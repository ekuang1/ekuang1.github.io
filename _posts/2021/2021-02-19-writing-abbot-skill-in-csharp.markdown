In my last post, I wrote about some of the interesting elements of C# we take advantage of to make [argument parsing in Abbot with C# nice](https://haacked.com/archive/2021/02/12/argument-parsing-with-abbot/).

In this post, I put it all together [in a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTkNraTGU8) that walks through writing a `sparkle` skill. This skill lets you give your friends and colleagues :sparkles:. It can track who gave the sparkle and how many sparkles a person received along with the reason for the sparkle. It's basically a kudos skill, but more sparkly!

Hope you enjoy the video and let me know if there's anything else you'd like to learn about or see with regards to Abbot.
