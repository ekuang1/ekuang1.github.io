message: "<p>@Mike: Same as with MVC4 :-) My understanding was that today we were supposed to get insight into the new stuff to come out with MVC4, but wasn't able to find anything really new. Nothing to justify almost a half a year since the last announcement, imo. Maybe there were big internal changes, but nothing was mentioned from what I could find. Am I missing something?</p>"
