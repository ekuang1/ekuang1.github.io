message: <p>Phil, are you working on automagically turning all JS and .NET Github repos into Nuget packages automatically in order to drive GitHub/OSS usage in the .NET community? Hope so, that would be awesome!<br>PPS I would be happy to be hired by GitHub to work on that if you are listening :)</p>
