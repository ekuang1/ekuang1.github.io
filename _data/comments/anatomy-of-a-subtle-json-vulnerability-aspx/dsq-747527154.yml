message: "<p>My suggestion to combat this (requires a bit of work obviously) is to encode a request key into every JSON url, like a one-time scratch pad. Perhaps an internal counter with a random starting seed that's SHA'd into the URL. Each JSON request would have to provide the next key to use, etc. Any invalid key would refuse access to the data.<br>URL example: <a href=\"https://haacked.com/demos/secret-info.json#f4c59b1e\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://haacked.com/demos/secret-info.json#f4c59b1e\">https://haacked.com/demos/secret-info.json#f4c59b1e</a></p>"
