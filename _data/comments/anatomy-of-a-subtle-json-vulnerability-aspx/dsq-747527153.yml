message: <p>thanks Phill for nice info (I wonder how are modern browsers stopping this attack), I've just read a security article about various web-attacks and this one was among them...this is but more to the point.<br>one question though, the attack only concerns "sensitive" data of particular (one) JSON request... so to say on most pages (that just show basic info) stealing the data wouldn't mean any harm, would it?<br>I mean things like credit cards info/goods price/private messages and things like that that exist, those are sensitive but I would not send them via JSON in the first place.<br>otherwise I am free to use JSON and AJAX on my page as I want, steal freely ;)</p>
