message: <p>@Saeed, I shall correct you then. :)<br>Here's a quote from the JSON spec:<br></p><blockquote>An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with [ (left bracket) and ends with ] (right bracket). Values are separated by , (comma).</blockquote><p><br>Thus if you send a JavaScript array it will be interpreted as valid JSON. Don't take my word for it. Try it yourself!</p>
