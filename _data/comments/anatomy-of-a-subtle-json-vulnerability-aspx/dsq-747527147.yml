message: <p>interesting post. yes, JSON is vulerable, but not in any way that is new. it's pretty easy for me to send sensitive data via XML, plain/text, etc. the patterns adopted by ASP.NET Ajax ("d:" and POST-only) are hurdles to ismple hacking, but they end up reducing useful interactions w/ other servers and clients not participating in these 'hacks.'<br><br></p>
