message: <p>Please no more dirty coding hacks or workarounds to deal with the ineptitude of HTML and javascript as an application platform. Either fix the platform, or better yet, put Silverlight, Flash (and *smirk* Java FX) into a CAGE DEATHMATCH until ONE comes out alive and we'll throw the whole HTML/Javascript/Ajax mess into an industrial strength car crusher (and if, while standing by looking on, Internet Explorer suspiciously trips and falls to it's death then so be it) and get on with our lives.</p>
