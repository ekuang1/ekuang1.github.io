message: <p>@Douglas technically, it's not a vulnerability *in* JSON. It's more of an issue with *using* JSON. If we could go back in time and redesign JSON, we'd probably make it such that the array would not be a valid javascript.<br>And it's really more of a CSRF attack combined with a reverse XSS attack. I say reverse XSS because in this case, you don't have to inject any scripts onto the good site. You just make a request for the good site's script and run it on <a href="http://evil.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="evil.com">evil.com</a>. Which is the opposite of the typical XSS attack. ;)</p>
