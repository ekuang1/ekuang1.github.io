message: <p>I have been struggling to get JQueryUI AutoComplete working with an ASMX web service. Yesterday, I got the round trip working and discovered the problem you describe in this article. I previously discovered that GET needed to be POST and a bunch of other small issues, but now I am trying to go the final mile to code-complete and I am stuck with the "d..." issue. I am not a JavaScript programmer, so I am not clear how to work around this. <br>Can you please post the last piece that shows how to remove the "d" prefix and restore the string to its proper state?<br>Thanks...</p>
