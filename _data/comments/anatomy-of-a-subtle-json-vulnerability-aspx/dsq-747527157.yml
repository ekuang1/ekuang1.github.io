message: <p>@Richard You are correct in that probably 99.9% of JSON services are unaffected. Not only would the service have to contain sensitive data for it to be a worry, but it would have to send the data as a pure array and not as a true JSON object. On top of that, it would have to allow for GET requests of that data.<br>However, it did hit GMail back in 2006. By now, I think it's *almost* a non-issue as far as I can tell, only FF 2.0 and earlier is succeptible. However, I could be totally wrong about that. You never know what other hijinks you can do with javascript. ;)</p>
