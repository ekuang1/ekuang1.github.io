message: <p>@Andy <br>The problem with your approach is what happens if the user ends up closing out the browser or browser tab before the event gets a chance to fire. You then have a disconnect between what the user expected to happen when the user clicked the delete button and what the software actually did. I generally consider that kind of situation to be a bug, even if the software is working exactly as intended.</p>
