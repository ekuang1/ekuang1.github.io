message: "<p>Nice job!<br>Suggestion: instead of having the a tags as :<br><code><a href=\"#1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"#1\">delete</a></code><br>I would like to see something like:<br><code><a href=\"/Controller/Action/1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"/Controller/Action/1\">delete</a></code><br>This way we don't have to specify the url option and the links will still work if javascript is disabled/unsupported/etc. (not that we should have Delete actions happening from a GET request...but that's a different topic) :)</p>"
