message: <p>Phil,<br>While I fully agree with the sentiment of this post, I don't really see how the jquery plugin has anything to do with 'undo' - it just seems like a wrapper around the AJAX calls to the server side actions that actually handle the delete/undo operations. Th implementations of the operations still need to be implemented by the user.<br>Or am I missing something?</p>
