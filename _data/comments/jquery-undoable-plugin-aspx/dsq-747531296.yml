message: "<p>Sorry, I didn't realize that a tag is also allowed, re-posting:<br>Nice job!<br>Suggestion: instead of having the a tags as :<br><code>a href=\"#1\" class=\"delete\"</code><br>I would like to see something like:<br><code>a href=\"Controller/Action/1\" class=\"delete\"</code><br>This way we don't have to specify the url option and the links will still work if javascript is disabled/unsupported/etc. (not that we should have Delete actions happening from a GET request...but that's a different topic) :)</p>"
