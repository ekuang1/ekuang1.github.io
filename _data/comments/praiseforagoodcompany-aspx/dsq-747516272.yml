message: <p>I was thinking the exact same thing yesterday when I had to call Cingular for a problem I had with my account getting billed for text messaging when I thought I had it covered<br>the guy just fixed the problem and they will credit me for the past two months, he gave information on the plans and explained why I wasn't covered and so on, I was really happy</p>
