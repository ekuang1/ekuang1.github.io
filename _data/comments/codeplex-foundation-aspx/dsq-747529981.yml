message: <p>Hey Phil, this is great news.<br>One thing that the codeplex foundation could to is to help create a system allowing developers to connect with projects and other developers with similar interests. The two biggest issues I see with OSS is the large entry barrier for new developers and the constant duplication of similar projects. Creating a kind of OSS dev meeting space could be a great way to help combat both of these issues. New developers could find projects that need help without going through codeplex project by project and potential project leaders could partner early on to merge ideas and prevent project duplication.<br>In fact, I would be happy to work on building a system to help do this if anybody is interested in working on it.</p>
