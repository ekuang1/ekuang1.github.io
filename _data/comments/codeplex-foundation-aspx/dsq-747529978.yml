message: "<p>I gotta say, I've been very impressed with Microsoft's recent transition into the realm of OSS. I've been arguing with my anti-MS colleagues that MS has been making a significant change of course as of late. <br>I've used you (phil) as an example of developers that MS has sought out to bridge the gap between .Net developers and the opensource world and I believe the approach is certainly working.<br>When I first started web development, I was drawn to C# as a language but disliked the framework (webforms) and the lack of opensource software was extremely limited. You, along with a number of other people, have at least fixed one of those issues for upcoming web developers with the release of Asp.Net MVC (thanks!). Now with a non-profit organization designed to further bridge the gap, I can only hope that more people will see the light and start developing open source applications (Paul Vencill and I are working on a CMS and hopefully we arent the only ones).<br>Thanks for your (and Microsoft's) efforts in making .Net a better ecosystem.<br>Quick question though: what will happen to <a href=\"http://codeplex.com?\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"codeplex.com?\">codeplex.com?</a></p>"
