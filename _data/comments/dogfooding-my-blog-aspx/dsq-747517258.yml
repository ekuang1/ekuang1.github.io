message: "<p>&amp;lt;strike&amp;gt;Ok, no problem, let's see do you have an interval queue rule? ;-)&amp;lt;/strike&amp;gt;<br>Yes, you have :-)<br>Phil,<br>Just two points: <br>1- After I got this error &amp;quot;Sorry, but there is a delay between allowing comments originating from the same source. Please wait for 5 minutes and try again.&amp;quot;, which I had to get, Live Comment Preview doesn't work anymore.<br>2- 5 minutes for interval is a long time.  I think one minute is good.  I use it on my site and it works very very well.</p>"
