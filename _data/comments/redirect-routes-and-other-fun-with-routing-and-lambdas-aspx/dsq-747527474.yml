message: <p>@Bryan you can actually use it that way. The reason I chose to implement another class was to use the DelegateRouteHandler directly, you need to pass a lambda, which itself takes in a lambda.<br>Nested lambdas are hard to format in such a way that your head doesn't spin in circles. :)</p>
