message: <p>Nice post, Phil!<br>I think one thing you've uncovered in this post is to make a clear distinction that Routing is something that the MVC framework uses, rather than being tightly coupled.<br>Another cool thing about the post is to show the flexibility of code that uses Func&lt;T,R&gt; as an implementation of a command pattern.</p>
