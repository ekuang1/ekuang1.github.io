message: "<p>I really like a tip I got from Scott Hanselman : Create a user on your laptop just for presentations, with all the setting already set.  <br>The other one which I see people ignoring all the time (which you hint at but don't expressly say):  In VS, auto-hide (unpin) all panels except for the source code.  (I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone try to show code by scrolling the window left/right/up/down while all the time they've got the Solution Explorer and Output panels open).<br></p>"
