message: "<p>I wanted the debugger mainly for debugging routes that don't work (meaning, error results: 404 or \"I couldn't find the view, and I searched everywhere\" type results). Routes that work are of little interest to me. The old debugger did this. The new one doesn't, or I have to configure stuff I don't know how to configure. I have gone back to the old debugger because of this.</p>"
