message: "<p>@Niel Knight: I found the same problem, my Javascript and CSS would have the route debugger html appended to the end of the response. I eventually found out it was the browser's cache persisting the route debugger as part of the response even after I disabled the route debugger, so I cleared my cache and everything was fine.</p>"
