message: <p>Hi All over there,<br>         Its really cool. I have started working with the control state. As you said i have followed all the steps. I have overridden those LoadControlState and SaveControlState methods to store the selected index of a dropdownlist.<br>Reason:<br>        I dont want the viewstate to be "ON". <br>Then it wont fire the SelectedIndexChange event.<br>So i used control state instead.<br>It Works fine. <br>Consider this scenario, where during every postback the selected index will be loaded and the same is retreived back. But when i change the selected index at the client side it will not be saved at the server. <br>Now this will not work right. Please tell me whether am i missing something.<br>Scenario explained <br>Let the selected index during post back is 4.<br>selected index in the control state = 4.<br>Change it in the JavaScript as 2.<br>Now change the selected index of the drop down back to 4 .. it will not fire the Selected Index change event.<br>Any suggestion would be graetly appreciated.<br><br><br><br></p>
