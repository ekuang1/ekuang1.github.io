message: <p>I'm finding it difficult to see the rational behind not allowing control state to be selectively disabled on the ListControl suite. Take a CheckBoxList that has a 100+ elements. <br>Why should the control state be pushed to the client if you're not interested in eventing? With the composite naming convention, we’re looking at 40K per trip for no reason…<br>The control should be able to re-apply post data without issue so long as we're binding it before LoadPostData is invoked?<br>More curiously, I'm finding that neither LoadControlState or SaveControlState are even called on a CheckBoxList override that includes no events! What a waste!!<br></p>
