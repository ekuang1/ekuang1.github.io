message: <p>Awesome! I'll be downloading this. What issues should I be aware of if I'm using a build that's several months old? I tried downloading the CVS source a couple weeks ago, and got an exception immediately, didn't really feel like debugging, and just reverted to my old build.<br><br><br><br>Thanks again!</p>
