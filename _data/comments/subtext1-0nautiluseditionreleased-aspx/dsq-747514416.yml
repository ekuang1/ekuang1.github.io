message: <p>If you've deployed an interim build of Subtext, then deploying the new build is a bit tricky as there may have been schema changes.<br><br><br><br>My recommendation is to use SQL Compare to compare the schemas.<br><br><br><br>If you are still runing .TEXT, then simply install Subtext following the installation guide.  You'll get to the point where you can select your .TEXT database to import from.</p>
