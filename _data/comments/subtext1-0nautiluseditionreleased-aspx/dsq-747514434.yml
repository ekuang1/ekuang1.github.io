message: <p>OK thanks, maybe I can downgrade my server until then, with my current solution (dasBlog)storing all the data in XML files was bad enough with one blog but needing to duplicate everything for a second blog is not what I consider an acceptible solution... I know the .NET stuff is backwards compatible, but alas the MSSQL isn't :(</p>
