message: <p>I agree that the enum does make the code more readable but  what happens when you are expecting a true (an enum with a value of 1) or false (an enum with a value of 2) value and someone sends your method a maybe (an enum with a value of 3)?<br>Wouldn't it make more sense if the variables fit together nicely to refactor it to a parameter object?</p>
