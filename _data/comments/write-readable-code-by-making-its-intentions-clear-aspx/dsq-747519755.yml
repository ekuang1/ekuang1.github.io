message: <p>"If you never use x, does it matter when it is GC'd?"<br>Only if x is a reference type that contains some references to resources (db connections, other ref types, etc...) that could tie up system resources. Maybe the called method always expected you to manually close a .connection object on x, or commit a transaction.<br>I've seen some executeSQL type statements that would return objects with properties that the calling method was expected to verify. If they verified, then the calling method had to call a "commit" method on the "x" type object.<br>That was some bad code.</p>
