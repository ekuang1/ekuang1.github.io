message: <p>Dr. Suess! Man you're gonna change your mind about this in 6 months or so when you're trying to read  Fox in Socks! <br>I still can't make my way through it, and I try to hide it from my kid but she still finds it and demands I read it. I don't know what Suess was trying to say with it and man if someone wrote "Fox in Sox Code" I would really have to freak like a geek and throw up in a cup<br>(Freak Geek in a Cup-thrower-upper)<br></p>
