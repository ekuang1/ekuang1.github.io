message: <p>Merry Christmas / Happy New Year to you as well.  That area is beautiful, When I was up there I stayed in some condo's just down from the main campus and remember getting up in the morning and seeing the lake (or at least I think it was a lake).  Its been 13 years since I was there, need to get back up there.</p>
