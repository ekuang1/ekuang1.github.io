message: <p>In 1924, the Austrian philosopher and scientist Rudolf Steiner gave eight lectures at Koberwitz, a private estate in Germany. During these small gatherings, he unwittingly created the foundations of biodynamic farming, an ideology that is, 80 years later, becoming more and more common a practice in vineyards around the world.<br><br><br><br>What does “biodynamic” mean? The crux of the method is the premise that a farm—or a vineyard—is a living, closed and self-sustaining ecosystem. This is an easy enough premise to accept, particularly for winemakers and enologists who think terroir the most essential ingredient of a great wine. (It’s no surprise, is it, that French winemakers are leading the biodynamism pack?) <br><br></p>
