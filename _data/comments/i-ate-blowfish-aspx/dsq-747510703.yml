message: <p>i used to have a porcupine blow fish at home. what a character! he was beautiful and always smiley and very sensitive n clever. danced whenever i wanted and followed me in his tank. used to do pirouettes! when he was dying he started to blow up and get really big. i held him in my hands and kissed him on the mouth! i cried for 2 weeks straight. i was heart broken! i didn't get poisoned or anything... his name was bebe!</p>
