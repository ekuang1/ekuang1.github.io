message: <p>Was stationed at Wakkanai, Japan, back in the 60's, and really enjoyed Japanese food. Never tried the fugu, but the sushi I did try was not to my taste. It was some kind of strong tasting fish, and the longer I chewed on it, the bigger it got. Never tried that again. Wakkanai is on the the northern end of Hokkaido, and it gets cold, very cold, up there. One thing I did eat was a rice and beef dish. At least I thought it was beef. Turns out it was dog . . . fortunately I didn't know that at the time. They also made a seafood soup with fish, squid, octopus, crab, noodles and seaweed (kelp) that was excellent, very hot and filling on a cold night.</p>
