message: <p>I actually tried blowfish before, at a restaurant in Ho Chi Minh when I came to visit and i could not think of any other word to describe it other than "tasteless" I've never had it fried before though and being a sushi lover, it was the first time eating sashimi that I didn't really favor</p>
