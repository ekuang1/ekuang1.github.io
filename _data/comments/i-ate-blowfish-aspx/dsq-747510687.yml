message: <p>Reminds me of my days working for Sony. We had to visit Japan a few times a year and they used to delight in taking us out to eat at some really strange joints. Ever had sashimi so fresh you actually pick it off the back of a live fish or the delicacy of the skin formed on top of warm soy milk? I used to take ceral bars with me to avoid starvation because eating this stuff was "dai-mondai desu" for me.<br><br><br><br>I do love sake though; served hot is best.</p>
