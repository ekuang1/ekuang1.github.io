message: <p>I've only been up to Stockton, but the drive is...really really bad.  I rank it up there on the 10 most boring road trips ever.  The highlight of the trip was the horrible cow smell somewhere in the middle.  I can't remember too much about that part as I'm able to blank out certain bad memories in my mind pretty effectively.<br>Geek dinners are always fun though.  Essentially my wife mainly puts up with it with the occasional "uh huh" and "oh that's neat".  If I go on too long though she tells me to go IM some other nerds to get out of her hair.</p>
