message: "<p>Probably the better way to do this is to map these files to the ASP.Net forbidden handler.<br>@Scott: I have no problem with the out of the box behaviour being that requests to those resources are denied, but I think you'd be giving responsibilities to the RoutingEngine that it ought not to have. The RoutingEngine's job is to turn a URL into :controller, :action, :params not authorize access to resources.</p>"
