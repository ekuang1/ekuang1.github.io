message: <p>Years ago, my father told me about an article he read where a student (now grown up) was recounting the best teacher he ever had. The story&lt;super&gt;*&lt;/super&gt; goes something like this:<br></p><blockquote><br>An elementary science teacher brought in a set of skeletal animal remains to class one day for the class to study. He spent two weeks showing the bones and talking about the prehistoric animal to which they belonged. He was very detailed about the animal from diet, habitation, and environment.<br>Eventually we were tested at the end of the two weeks, on what we had learned. Much to our dismay we all failed the test. The reasoning... They were cat bones! Our teacher had made the whole thing up. He stated that we all failed because not once did we ever attempt to question the information he presented. No one ever verified what he said, but blindly accepted it as truth.<br>Of course there was a small witch trial for the teacher and the parents were ready to crucify him over damaging their poor little innocent babies in such a cruel way. Being that this story took place decades ago in a much less politically correct environment, the school board upheld his decision.<br>The author went on to say that the entire class questioned everything from then on out. It was the greatest and most valuable lesson he ever learned.<br></blockquote><p><br>In the end I think we should always question answers, even our own.<br>&lt;super&gt;*&lt;/super&gt;<em>I don't have the original source, so this was all drawn from memory.</em></p>
