message: <p>I'm not so sure about your apparatus here in the U.S, but I went to school in Northern Canada.  It was quite possible to do an experiment 3 different times and get 3 different results based on faulty/outdated equipment. Confirmation bias saved us. ;)<br>There was also the other factor to alter your thinking about the experiment - peer pressure.  Many times we would do an experiment with clearly measurable results, but your partner would make you second guess or introduce confirmation bias.  It adds another dimension to steering away from Scientific method.<br>Great post Phil,<br></p>
