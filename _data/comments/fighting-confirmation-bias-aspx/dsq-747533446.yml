message: <p>Phil, thanks for posting this information. Very interesting to read.<br>One thing that's not usually covered in this topic is the benefits of bias.<br>One of my mentors tells the story of when he ran a research and development company. He'd have a group of around 15 people who would meet weekly to discuss developments they'd made and each week he'd tell them how he'd found a way to do x and for them to figure it out also.<br>Once they'd figured out how to do x they'd explain how they got the same result too. The important thing was that he hadn't figured out how to do x at all, he just wanted them to think it was possible and thus the 15 of them together would figure it out and teach him.<br>Sometimes when the bias is based on the plausibility and possibility of something being achievable, it becomes so.<br>A bit of food for thought.</p>
