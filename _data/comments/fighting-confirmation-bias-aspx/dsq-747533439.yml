message: <p>While I agree that science educators need to include more open-inquiry labs (which they are these days actually), in general it is far more likely that the student did actually bump the apparatus to cause the strange measurement rather than stumbling upon a strange result. Further, in science as a field, if you are going to report something that bucks the traditional understanding, you had better repeat and repeat and confirm and confirm what you are going to report. You are going to be tested and questioned by EVERYONE. Therefore, I do not think its a problem to teach scientists to be wary of strange results and be sure of what they think they've seen.</p>
