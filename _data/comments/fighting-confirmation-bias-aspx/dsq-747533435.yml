message: <p>I remember doing an experiment in high school physics (33 years ago) where we measured the position of a falling object.  We then had to fit a curve to the graph of position vs time.  Eveyone in the class dutifully found that the position was proportional to the square of the time.  In my report I said that the power of time could have been anywhere between 1.8 and 3 due to the estimated errors in the measurements.  The teacher marked this as wrong with the comment that the position is propotional to the square of the time.  Having been penalised for following the scientific method, I never did it again and always returned the 'correct' answer as the conclusion of an experimental report.<br>I did very well in science subjects at school because I knewn the answers that were required (and kept the correct answers to myself)</p>
