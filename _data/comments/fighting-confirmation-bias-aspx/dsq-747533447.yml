message: <p>Reminds me of a couple of examples in physics. <br>First, Rutherford's work on the atom c. 1910. He had an apparatus that would fire alpha particles (From either a radium or polonium source, cant remember) through a thin gold foil onto a scintillation screen. Rutherford was a great experimentalist and he had he insight to know what variations of the setup to try. So he had Ernest Marsden, an undergrad in his lab, put a scintillation screen *behind* the gold foil. Amazingly flashes were observed there and this lead to the hypothesis that the atom has a massive nucleus concentrated in a small space (Which then lead to Borh's early work in 1913 on quantum theory, etc, etc). The amazing thing is that Rutherford did not expect this setup to yield any results but wanted to eliminate other setups making sure he was covering all his bases. So he had a bias but choose to explore all possibilities despite that bias and it yielded results that lead to the quantum revolution and nuclear physics (And a TON of other stuff). <br>Another example is Michelson and his experiments to prove the existence of the aether (IE, Michelson &amp; Morley experiment, et al). This example goes along with what Chad was saying where its good to try to prove what you believe. In the end the experiments did not successfully prove that there was an aether. Unfortunately Michelson allowed his confirmation bias to prevail and did not allow the results of this experiment to shape his beliefs. Einstein's work on relativity showed that whether the aether existed or not was irrelevant. Throughout all this Michelson never budged on his belief of the aether and how it could unify physics. He allowed confirmation bias to prevail. <br>There are many other examples, like with Einstein &amp; quantum mechanics. In that case Einstein's bias towards a classical world picture (With explanations that can be understood classically) served him well with his development of relativity but lead him to largely disregard quantum mechanics (Ironically his 1905 work on the photo electric effect was part of the foundation of QM). Although as we've see throughout the last century that relativity and QM have both proven themselves to be solid theories. So can confirmation bias be a good thing sometimes? I guess if your bias yields good results. :)</p>
