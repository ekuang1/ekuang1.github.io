message: "<p>I remember a story my Dad used to tell about following the crowd while in the boy scouts: All the father/son scout teams were given the same objective, with the same clues, using compass, etc. At the end of the day they were left feeling pretty uncomfortable, since everyone had reached the same destination, and it was a long distance from theirs. However, in the end, they were the only team that got the challenge right.<br>In an age where we are all taught to question authority/the status quo, it's ironic that it has really only meant to adhere to a new status quo, but without ever asking why.<br>I find it rare to find an 'expert' that actually is.</p>"
