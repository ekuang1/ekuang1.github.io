message: <p>I always felt that computer scientists are very odd scientists in that they hardly concern themselves with issues in the other vistas of science that are not directly relevant to software and hardware. <br>This article is definitely an exception. There's hope that someday, we in CS will mature into a discipline that also pays attention to the philosophy of science.<br>And when you hear some folks wondering what the point of this blog post is, they probably can't directly relate it to much of compiling code ... lots of code. People, it's sufficient for it to be just a scientific discourse, ok?!</p>
