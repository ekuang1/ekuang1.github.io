message: <p>This cracks me up.  I am totally in agreement with Jim on the QA deal.  QA is also to verify that features meet the needs of the original story.  While users can verify it in Quick Agile meetings going over stories and showing progress, it's still good to have QA go over functionality as it relates to the story to make sure it meets requirements.  I've seen this in action, you definitely need QA but you need GOOD QA who know what they should be doing, not finding bugs but testing functionality, usability, etc. which is more important which I think you need both UX (a good UX person who focuses on usability not just creating graphics) and QA working together on that. If TDD is done well bugs are at a bare minimum and then QA should be more focused on story requirements and circling around to double check them.</p><p>I"m sorry I'm a developer and I can say not only I, but all developers don't know shit about a good UX and it's not our job anyway, I don't care what each developer may claim.  You need to have someone who knows UX in terms of "experience", "flow", "whitespace", etc. to make sure the experience makes sense and there are no part of the app that seem usable to you the developer but there might be flaws that even the business overlooked or improvements to the UX that might make a case to move x Story to a new iteration for the better.   </p><p>But in the end I wish our Trade would freaking move forward for Christ sakes and do what you should be doing TDD and I even say XP; we're only at about 10% in reality overall in this world which is just pathetic at this point.  Tired of those shops not doing TDD yet, there should be no tolerance for such amateur ways of engineering...that being without TDD.  Take a look at Cengage Learning's XP teams, and you'll see why XP and TDD is the only way to go.</p>
