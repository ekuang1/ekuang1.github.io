message: <p>I'm a tester. Not a developer. There, said it.</p><p>Quality Assurance is NOT testing code, QA is testing and *assuring* process. Whilst the developer may write 100% test covered code, if the test process is wrong or if the tests themselvesÂ  do not meet real world requirements then your 100% test covered code is worthless - the code works, the tests pass - it doesn't do what the client requires.</p><p>A dedicated QA tester will test methodology, requirements, UX and more. A developer will test code.</p>
