message: <p>"when I approach code I wrote yesterday, it’s almost as if I’m someone else approaching the code."</p><p>That's true for most developers including me except when I write code for UI and I tend to be more emotionally engaged so I remember "paths" or "user stories" for which I made that UI code. It must take years before I can sit and see this UI as fresh user and discover bugs. Yes, testing is definitely our job as developers but in some cases it's good to know about limitation. Okay, maybe it's all about experience. Later you tend to think about more and more those "unexpected paths". But still, there is always something on the corner, I think :-)</p>
