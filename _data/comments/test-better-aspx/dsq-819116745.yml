Part of them going to work is about doing the best job possible.</p><p>Others are developer prima-donnas and quite arrogant, and just don't have that enthusiasm to do a thorough job of testing it manually.</p><p>There's a lot more to in that, but I think motivation is a big factor. Glad you raised the topic Phil.</p>
