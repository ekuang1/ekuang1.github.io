message: <p>Good senior software engineers aren't cheap.  There has to be a balance.  For example, if I spent an hour testing the code I just wrote and found an obscure bug that a tester making less than half would have found in that same hour, was that really a win for the company?  I can tell you what my boss and CEO would say.</p><p>I'm in a SaaS situation.  It might be a different situation for independent contractors and consultants, when their customer really is another company and they can't rely on a dedicated team of testers to put their work through the ringer before hitting end users in production.</p>
