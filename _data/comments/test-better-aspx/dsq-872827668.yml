message: <p>Three words; Separation of Concerns. Developers should develop. Testers should test. Developer machine should be setup to develop applications productively. It is not a good test environment. Tester machine must be setup for testing and smoking out bugs productively. The keyword here is "productiveness". If you are busy switching role between being a developer and a tester, you waste a lot of valuable resources.</p>
