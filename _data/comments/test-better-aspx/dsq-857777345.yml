message: <p>Yea, and I had a manager who believed that we didn't need QA or PMs because Devs could do everything. Think about that, if we got rid of tester and PMs, we would need to hire a lot more Devs. But just like a Ford assembly line, people will work better and faster at the jobs they are good at. Can I test? Yep. Can I manage? Sure. But do I do those as well as I develop? Nope. Could I learn to do them as well? Maybe. Are there people who are better testers and PMs than devs? Of course! So why would I make devs do jobs that they are not as good at, when there are people who are actually good at those jobs? Why would I not hire people for their strengths where those jobs are needed instead of making a group of people learn something that they will be OK at?</p>
