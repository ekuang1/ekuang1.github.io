message: <p>I find myself having difficulty sometimes testing UI code, because I tend to do things "right" (as in, not in a way that would make it break). Because I wrote it, and know exactly what you are supposed to do to achieve a specific result, I often miss the "what if the end user is stupid?" bugs. In the business end of the code, I can imagine myriad possibilities where some dumb programmer misused my code and I need to defend myself from doing something wrong, but I can't always dream of the ways that end users have managed to mess things up.</p>
