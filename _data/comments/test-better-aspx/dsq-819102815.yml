message: <p>I guess developers denying their ability to test is a form of self preservation as well. It obviously it depends on the company you work for, but us developers can be portrayed as incapable for doing something as horrible as creating a bug.  When you say that developers can't test their own code you just shift the responsibility :)</p>
