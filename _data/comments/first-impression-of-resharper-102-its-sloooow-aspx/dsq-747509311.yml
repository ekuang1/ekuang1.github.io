message: <p>I've been using CodeRush from DevExpress (<a href="http://www.devexpress.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.devexpress.com">www.devexpress.com</a>) for the past several months and am really enjoying it. <br><br><br><br>While I haven't tried the released version of Resharper, the one area where CodeRush may NOT be as favorable is with refactoring. CodeRush's refactoring support is currently fairly minimal, though DevExpress has mentioned that more is in the works on that front. There are also a lot of capabilities that someone with regex skills could exploit for refactoring. <br><br><br><br>I can say that it's quite fast, has similar intellisense enhancements, auto-completion templates, and a bunch more. They have an eval you can download to compare it.<br><br><br><br>BTW - I'm not affiliated with DevExpress in any way other than being a customer.</p>
