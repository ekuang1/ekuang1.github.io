message: "<p>I disliked the slow and in my eyes ugly code completionwindow aswell. I got this reply from one of the resharper people:<br><br><br><br>- re-enable VS completion through Tools/Options/TextEditor/C#; you may stop after this just to see what you will loose if you proceed, but two completion lists are not nice, three lists are not too;<br><br>- uncheck boxes regulating completion list auto-popup in ReSharper/Options/Code Completion; I'd recommend to stop here: you'll get VS completion, but Ctrl+Space will toggle ReSharper code completion;<br><br>- remap ReSharper.CompleteCode command in Tools/Options/Environment/Keyboard to a shortcut different from Ctrl+Space and map VS Complete Co&amp;de to Ctrl+Space instead.</p>"
