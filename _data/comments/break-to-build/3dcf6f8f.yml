message: Great post, Phil.  I agree 100%.  Taking care of basic necessities via universal healthcare, universal education, and UBI would get a lot more talented people to the table who are otherwise occupied meeting the basic needs of their family.  Ranked choice voting would give us more options in our leadership.  We have all the brain power (and capital) that we need to solve our greatest problems.  In some areas we need more willpower, but for the most part, we just need to fix our systems.  They're buggy.
