  Very interesting post. This is now a global problem where politics has become so polarised, that it is hard to find someone who represents the more moderate views of the mass of the population.  You end up voting against candidates rather than for them. I like the idea of ranked choice voting.



  However, we need to be careful when talking about "best candidates" and "best ideas".  I've recently been in a discussion about this elsewhere. For me, democracy is not about the best candidates and ideas, it's about the most popular ones. It will not ensure that the best ideas win. They often don't. This is why many countries have a constitution that cannot be changed by a simple majority. It often needs a super majority or double majority approval in more than one chamber to be changed.
