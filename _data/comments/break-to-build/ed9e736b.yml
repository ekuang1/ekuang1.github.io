message: "If we actually had more than 2 parties much of our political system would be fixed.  A novel idea I heard once was make everyone serve in congress for 4 years just either in the senate or house and like jury duty no one can go back again, for the next term. The flood of new ideas and also get the money out of politics.  \r\n\r\nI think you  need to read the history of why we have an electoral college.  It's a brilliant way to make rural areas votes count as much as urban areas, and not have a serfdom to concentrated areas of the country.  That's why each state is separate and allowed to govern themselves.  If they do a bad job of it, then the voters of that state can fix it.  \r\n\r\nI wonder why we can't figure out virtual voting,  we have all this technology and almost everyone has a phone or computer, so why not allow voting that way?? Obviously with the security in place and verifications.  Then everyone could vote easily. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
