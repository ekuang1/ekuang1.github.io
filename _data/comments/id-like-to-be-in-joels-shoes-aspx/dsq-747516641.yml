message: "<p>First off, I love the Mark Wahlberg pic from <a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0202470/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0202470/\">Rock Star</a>, perfect for the subject. :)<br>There are a few top-notch developers in my aggregator that I enjoy reading and respect profusely as professional developers, but consider them to be arrogant a-holes with regard to their personality. In fact, I touch on the subject in <a href=\"http://dirtydogstink.com/blog/2006/08/07/IAmKarmasBitch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://dirtydogstink.com/blog/2006/08/07/IAmKarmasBitch.aspx\">this post</a>. Just to be clear, I don't even read Joel that frequently [only when someone points out a good article of his] so I'm not saying that he is included in this category.<br>What I like to see is the overall conversation from the different perspectives. That's something I, as a fairly new developer, can learn from. You, Joel, Jeff, Scott and many others are a perfect example of how that conversation can move forward to not only educate some of us, but to help our industry continue to grow in a positive direction.<br>ps: the Xanax comment had me rolling! :)</p>"
