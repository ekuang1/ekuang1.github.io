message: "<p>Well, I'm going to comment again because I haven't really been reading your blog, but lately I have ended up back here several times.  I always see the comments on Coding Horror and think to myself, I should add Haacked to my RSS list.  Done.<br>Your right, Joel is basically the rockstar of the software development industry.  He is also very arrogant.  Quite a bit of the time I get very frustrated and annoyed because Joel comes from the complete opposite background that I do (Ivy League, Microsoft, C).  I'm a programmer who is basically self taught, never worked in assembly language, and started in VB.<br>All that being said, Joel has some great knowledge that every programmer should read.  As far as a writer goes, Joel is my idle.  I started creating sites and blogs just so I could practice writing like Joel: comical and interesting.<br>I think what's going on is Joel is right so often that it's great to nail him when he makes a remark so arrogant and contrary to his own beliefs and statements.<br>I love Mike Gunderloy's comment: \"I think it's predictable that someone will be along momentarily to call BS on the notion that developers don't care about money.\"<br>I'll definitally continue to read JoelOnSoftware and I'll also be making a point to read Haacked in the future.</p>"
