message: "<p>Think I found a bug. There is apparently a known issue when you use the [Authorize] attribute on an action method or class, it redirects to \"Account/Login\" instead of deferring to config setting in web.config (see Sean Paul's comments @ <a href=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2010/10/06/asp-net-mvc-3-beta-released.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2010/10/06/asp-net-mvc-3-beta-released.aspx\">haacked.com/.../asp-net-mvc-3-beta-released.aspx</a>). The solution was to add &lt;add key=\"AutoFormsAuthentication\" value=\"false\" /&gt; to the &lt;appSettings&gt; of web.config. But that didn't work for me.<br>To recreate: Make new MVC website (with all default \"home\", \"about\" template stuff in there). Set [Authorize] attrib to Home controller class. Move the _ViewStart.cshtml to the root of the app (this is to have all Areas use the same layout page - instead of just the default/root area). Boom. Any other workarounds?</p>"
