message: <p>I would like to start learning <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc 3 (I'm windows programmer with few years experience). Is it a good idea to start reading a book about <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc 2 and then learn all changes from blogs/tutorials? or should I wait for a book about mvc 3? Thanks for answer.</p>
