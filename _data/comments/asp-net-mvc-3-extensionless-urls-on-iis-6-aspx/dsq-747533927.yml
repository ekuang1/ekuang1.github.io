message: <p>I tried IIS6 &amp; mvc2 on windows server 2003. It is easy to implement the extentionless url feature. The only problem is that it will eat up much more memory than a normal <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> web form application.  But that is ok since I like MVC.</p>
