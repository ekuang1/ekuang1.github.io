message: <p>I did Disney's itinerary out of Vancouver last month. Really loved it. Disney's adult areas, including the pool, are never crowded. Enjoyed the hot tub alone while navigating the inner passage. Also, their kids areas offer as much or little structure as they want, which seems solid for my kid.</p><p>Cruising is fantastic. Can't get enough.<br><a href="http://jeffputz.com/blog/our-alaska-adventure-on-the-disney-wonder-july-2016-part-1" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://jeffputz.com/blog/our-alaska-adventure-on-the-disney-wonder-july-2016-part-1">http://jeffputz.com/blog/ou...</a></p>
