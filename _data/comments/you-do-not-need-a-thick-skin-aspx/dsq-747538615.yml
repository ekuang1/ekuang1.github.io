message: "<p>I completely agree with this! As anyone who reads my blog is aware, I tend to have some strong opinions when it comes to things I like and dislike.<br>It hurts coming the other way, too - as you're saying. But I do think Sam's post missed a crucial point: most of the time people enjoy ripping apart the person, as well as the code.<br>For instance: when you read something that confuses you or you think is bad, a typical thought might be \"WHO WROTE THIS CRAP\". The \"WHO\" part doesn't matter - yet many people really want to know who because they can now make themselves feel better by identifying someone not as smart as them.<br>This is one of the reasons I've stopped blogging as much these days. I would write code to illuminate and understand things - and the amount of \"You just LOVE to chase new, fashionable things! I don't have time for all this cool kid stuff\".<br>The whole cycle has become boring. There comes a time when you thicken your skin so much you can't feel anything, including your desire to create. For me, open-sourcing the things I write is a pain vector. The podcast, which I love dearly, would probably have died were it not for Hanselman cheering me on.<br>I like well-thought our criticism. I crave it! When it comes it fires me and keeps me going because I *learn something*. Usually the other person does too. This seems the exception, however, and it's sad.</p>"
