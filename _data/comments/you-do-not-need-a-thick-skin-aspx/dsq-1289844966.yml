message: <p>Hi there! Good move on responding to the underlying emotion, not the words out of people's mouths. As a product owner who does support, I've learned most people are so used to being totally ignored, denied, corporatespeked, etc., into hell that if you do respond like a person, they feel quite a bit of shame at their original behavior.</p><p>One thing, thoughâ€¦ if one comment from a stranger makes you spiral into a pit of self-doubt, there is something wrong. It's not that you need a thicker skin, it's that you need to learn to dissociate the way people view you from the way you view yourself. Maybe you've been abused in the past or maybe you just abuse yourself by beating yourself up, silently, internally, when you do things wrong, and so the external voices are just familiar reminders. But that's not a healthy reaction, not for you or anyone. That's something to work on -- feeling good about yourself, no matter what people say. Because of your actions, not your image, not the way people think about you.</p>
