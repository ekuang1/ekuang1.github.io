message: <p>Within the limit of my experience, I totally agree with Mr. Haack. The cartoon also summarizes nicely how I feel with respect to positive vs. negative feedback on my cute little beginner type blog. <br>I learn to code on weekends and evenings. I am slow, and I will likely never be "caught up" sufficiently to write/blog/create some slick new wonder of coding. But I love what I do, and I write about it, for myself, and because someone else in my shoes may run across what I have done and find it useful. <br>To the Robs and Phils, and others who actually know what you are doing, and publish code/blogs etc, your content and code is what allows folks like myself to catch the fire, and learn. <br>This is a universal problem, not limited to programming. However, there are many parallels between what you propose here, and what Mr. Bailey discusses here:<br><a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/12/14/dear-open-source-project-leader-quit-being-a-jerk/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/12/14/dear-open-source-project-leader-quit-being-a-jerk/">lostechies.com/...</a><br>In particular, this observation seems relevant:<br></p><blockquote><em><br>"The worst part of this is knowing that some of these “OSS Elite” were the geeks and freaks and nerds in high school, that got picked on by the jocks and other popular kids. Apparently the new found success in the open source community has caused selective amnesia in these “leaders” and they either don’t remember or don’t care about how it felt to be trampled upon by the popular voice in the room. The victims are becoming the perpetrators, and we are often laughing right along side with them.</em></blockquote><p><br>Thanks for the great post. <br></p>
