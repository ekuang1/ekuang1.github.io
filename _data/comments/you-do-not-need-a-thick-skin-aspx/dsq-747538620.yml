message: <p>@Rob if you stop blogging, then the terrorists win. Or something like that. You bring up an interesting point though. Critiquing a blog post is a bit different because there's not a "I'm trying to use this and I'm frustrated" angle, but more of a "I disagree with you."<br>When someone says "You're just chasing the latest fashion.", perhaps there's a subtext there you can get to the bottom of. Why do they feel that way? Are they feeling threatened perhaps. Perhaps they feel so threatened they're missing the obvious benefits of this new thing and only focusing on the negatives. In any case, it's an opportunity for more insight. Or, just ignore it as trolling and move on. ;)<br>@Joe, yeah I think that's the big part. Even though I saw these as opportunities to help, I'd still let it affect my mood negatively. But now I look at it as a challenge to see if I can "turn that frown, upside down." ;)</p>
