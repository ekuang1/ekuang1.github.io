message: <p>"In just a few short years Prototype went from best practice to anti-pattern..."<br>That sentiment really strikes a chord for me. As software developers we will frequently spend so much time and effort on a single concept that when that magic moment happens when we've pulled it off...we feel proud and happy. *dust hands* Maybe put that code up on a shelf, admire it for a bit, and then move on.<br>However, the web is an archive of history while other technologies move so fast. I have received negative messages from people who were using something I wrote in 2004 as if it shipped right before they came across it. You know what? Things have improved. I've improved. Arg!<br>I'll be keeping "I am definitely not my code. But I am here to help you with it." in mind going forward.<br><br></p>
