message: <blockquote><br>When you sincerely address peopleâ€™s frustrations, they tend to respond very warmly.<br></blockquote><p><br>Negative criticism is always hard to take. The best thing you can do is roll with the punches. Or as some may say, "kill them with kindness" :-)<br>If you want to see a good example of sincere people, look at Rackspace's support team. Those guys are so damn nice. No matter what the issue is, I can never get mad at them. They have a very positive culture, and that's how I feel about your blogs as well.<br>At the end of the day, you just have to be the better person. Be the person you want to be and good will follow.</p>
