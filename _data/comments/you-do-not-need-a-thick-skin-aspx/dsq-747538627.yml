message: "<p>@Phil The subtext seems pretty clear and I think you hit it: Change Sucks. This is for many reasons but I find it's because when a person feels they've mastered a thing, they *know* it. Like the line from Fight Club where Edward Norton was lamenting his apartment being blown up and how he was almost complete.<br>\"I know thing X. It works - why do you need to go and suggest something new? You must have a habitual need to keep trying new things... try getting some work done for a change\".<br>I think it's healthy to challenge new ideas - it's how they become better ideas or get blown up for the bad ideas they apparently are. I'm not sure when this happened to me, personally - I think it's when I went to bat all those years trying to get people to try MVC and Rails (and duking it out with Brinkman if I recall correctly...) - that somewhere along the line it became a bit of a sideshow.<br>After seeing recent events unfold and losing it when my kids got off the bus on Friday - I think something inside me broke. I like writing code, I love making videos, I also like to write. I utterly abhor the discussion patterns that follow a public display of anything new.<br>I don't know. Maybe I'll move to Hong Kong and hang out with Karl :).</p>"
