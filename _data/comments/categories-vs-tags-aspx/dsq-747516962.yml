message: <p>It would be super groovy to be able to tag certian content within a blog (almost along the microformat, but this would be for readers). So users could highlite some text and "tag" it somehow. I've always wanted to do something like this since a post is really a bunch of taggable ideas. Then, if you want to search on a tag it's a lot more relevant.</p>
