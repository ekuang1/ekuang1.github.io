message: '<p>With C# code conventions I think that to a degree, coders who may have started with a dynamically typed language like javascript over a static typed language like C# would prefer coding conventions for example: curly brace with a space or without a space as opposed (seen often in javascript) to those who started with C# who would from my experience have a curly brace with a new-line, or is that just me...?</p>'
