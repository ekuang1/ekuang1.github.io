message: "<p>One thing I'd like to know (and one thing that would probably be difficult to measure) is how many developers prefer so-called \"smart tabs\":  basically, using tabs for indentation, and spaces for alignment.</p><p>For example, if I were declaring a class method, I would indent the function, and if the arguments continued on to the next line, I would tab to the indentation level of that function, and then put spaces to align the next arguments.  Similarly, if I'm aligning end-of-line comments, I would use spaces, and these would remain constant, regardless of tab size.</p><p>This format allows individuals to specify their tab sizes to their heart's content, while preserving alignment!  I also like how making tabs visual also illustrates the alignment of the code.</p><p>Now, having said this, I would also have to point out that this table should be taken with a grain of salt:  while I prefer \"smart tabs\", in practice, I usually use spaces, because that's what's required by the coding standards of the organization or project I'm working on.</p>"
