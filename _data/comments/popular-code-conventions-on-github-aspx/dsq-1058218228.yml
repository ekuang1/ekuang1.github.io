message: <p>For C#, StyleCop was the first thing that came to mind. My team uses it and I couldn't code without it anymore. It takes some time to get everybody on board, but it pays off. I think it also follows the 'Framework Design Guidelines'.</p><p>So we've got this great tool, but I don't know why not everyone is using it.<br>Maybe because it's a plugin (and only for Visual Studio) and most people don't know about it? (Although I can be added to the build process easily.)</p>
