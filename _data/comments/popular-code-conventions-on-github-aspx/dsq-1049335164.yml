message: <p>The problem with a lot of conventions is that they are adopted out of personal preferences, while the goal of all the conventions is a common language to increase the comprehensibility (is that a word?) of the code for the benefit of OTHER developers. And the only thing in any of these religious wars that actually can adapt to an individual's personal preferences is that tabs always look the way BOTH the reader and the writer of the code want. When looked at through the lens of coding style increasing readability, tabs wins the logical argument over spaces. Every. Single. Time.</p>
