message: <p>Thank you for this...<br>I had Amiga since 1990 (I am '83.), mostly for gaming :).<br>It would be nice to remember of those days and those old, but great games.<br>I remember the first game I played, but I cannot remember it's name though.<br>It's something like Warblade and Air Strike 3D combined together, with the objects on the ground who shoot at you and those who fly by, but it's not Galaga :).<br>You can play this with two players at the same time.<br>I would like to play this game over the emulator.<br>Great post.</p>
