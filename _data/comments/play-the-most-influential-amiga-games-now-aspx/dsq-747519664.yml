message: <p>Oh... those days... I really miss those days...<br>All of the weekends of my childhood (with my 3 brothers and one sister) was spent on my dad's Amiga 500 ...<br>My favorite games are:<br>* Prince of Persia<br>* Cannon Fodder<br>* International Karate (IK+)<br>* Twintris<br>* Super Frog<br>* Lotus 1 and 2<br>* Shadow of the Beast I, II and III<br>* Shadow Dancer<br>.... oh, a long list to mention...<br>And I loved RedSector demos, and a demo called "Living Colors" that I could never find its ADF.</p>
