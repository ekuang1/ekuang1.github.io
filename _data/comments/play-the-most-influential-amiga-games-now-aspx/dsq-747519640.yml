message: <p>What a lot of Amiga memories here, having had an A500 and then an A1200 (what a machine that was!)<br>Speedball 2 is always a big signature game for me, along with Civilization and Powermonger - which I preferred to the more popular Populous!<br>I may have to check out some of the emulation stuff now, thanks for the nostalgia!</p>
