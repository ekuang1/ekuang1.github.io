message: '<p>Hi,<br>This machine and the Atari 1024STF teach me how to code. Basic then assembly. The co-processors of the Amiga were amazing. I even owned an Amiga 1200: this was the end of an era of plain fun personal computers that just worked.<br>I miss these days a lot.<br>Something I loved and still love is the sound produced by the Commodore C64 and the Amiga. The SID processor was brilliant. It sounded like techno well ahead of its time.<br>Cheers.<br></p>'
