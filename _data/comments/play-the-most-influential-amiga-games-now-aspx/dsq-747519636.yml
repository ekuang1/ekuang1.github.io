message: <p>"As a lowly Commodore 128 owner, which was really just a glorified Commodore 64 in a beige case"<br>It is apparent that you are on crack. The question is, what KIND of crack are you on? ;)<br>The C-128 had 80-col RGB output, not to mention a built in machine language monitor for debugging and ... other activities. An entire CPU dedicated to emulating the CPM and C-64. Enhanced BASIC, which meant you didn't have to peek and poke as much. I ran a BBS off of my 128 for a few years.<br>Glorified C-64 indeed.<br>Don't forget the MyUAE for Palm <a href="http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jonash/palmos/palmos_free.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jonash/palmos/palmos_free.html">http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de...</a><br>The most fun I've had on a commute was playing M.U.L.E. on my c-64 emulator on my Palm.</p>
