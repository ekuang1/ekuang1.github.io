message: <p>You're experience of the Amiga mirrors mine in many ways! I went to a show and bought the Amiga 500, used it for an hour, and then the power brick went, I was devestated! But once I got it back, it was something else - ok I was upgrading from a Vic 20 ;)<br>I loved my Amiga for teachng about programming, I remember using Devpac and AMOS a lot, and also creating plug-ins for BBS'<br>You've inspired me to go dust off my Amiga too and get Speedball out again. In fact I think I have Lords of the rising sun somewhere too!!</p>
