message: <p>A list of the most influential Amiga games which doesn't include Populous?  Empire? Arkanoid?  Dungeon Master?  TV Sports Football?  Death Sword?<br>Ok, I added that last one cause it was fun to whack the guys head off and watch the little troll drag it from the screen.<br>My god, Dungeon Master is the precursor to Wolfenstein 3d, the precursor to the old first person shooter.  Not influential?  BAH!</p>
