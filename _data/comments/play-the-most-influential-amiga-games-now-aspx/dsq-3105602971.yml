message: <p>I also loved my Amiga. Some of the best games ever made were on that thing.</p><p>The one that stood out most for me was The Settlers! They still struggle even now to make real time city builders as good as that. I had the demo disk from Amiga Format. I knew I had to have the game. So for Christmas I asked for the game and also the 1Mb ram upgrade so I could play it with all the extra sound effects. What a Christmas that was!</p><p>How they fit all that on a few floppy disks, amazing.</p>
