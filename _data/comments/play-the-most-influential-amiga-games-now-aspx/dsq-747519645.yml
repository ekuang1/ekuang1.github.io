message: <p>Some of the best drive-em-ups and table top racers known to man,<br>along with many other classics. The pinball games were something else, nobody mentioned any of the great PD software or utilities like Protracker and Octamed or Cygnus editor, i really miss the dependability and lack of big blue UH-OH screen.<br>*Roadkill<br>*Overdrive<br>*Protracker<br>*Alien Breed<br>*Project X<br>all that Tean 17 stuff, Demos by Fairlight and the like.<br>There was such a feeling of community that you just dont get with the PC crowd of the present day.</p>
