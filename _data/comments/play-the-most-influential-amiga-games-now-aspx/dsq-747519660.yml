message: <p>WOW.. this really takes me back.. i was actually looking for infoon Heindal.. i played that on the amiga as a kid and was talking to my cuz about it today..  There are loads of great games.. Funny cos me my bro and my sis were all left handed, joysticks were all for right handed people so we became ambidextrous .. thank you amiga 500 PLUS lmao..  <br>Golden Axe, Cannon Fodder, Giana Sisters which were a Mario Bros rip off hahaha...  SPOT, kids gloves, kick off... Speed Ball that was one of my speciality games!  GODS was EPIC....  Prince of Persia...  James Pond was great fun too!! <br>My dad had the Comodore 64 and i have memories as a 2-3 years old of a black screen and white outline diamond and my dad looking like a big kid... He was a total elite freak!...  My brother and I followed in his God like foot prints hahahaha and still love gaming today.. my sis not so much! .. <br>GOD BLESS THE AMIGA!</p>
