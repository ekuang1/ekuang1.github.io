message: <p>Well, since Phil went and mentioned that it was my idea, I suppose now I have to defend it. :) <br><br><br><br>I do understand [and agree] that in an Open Source application, time is even more critical than in a "Work Project." As a result, the time lapse that it takes for a reviewer to look at the code, make comments, and then have the original author make any changes is too great. People are busy... believe me, I understand that! But who's to say that the reviewer will have the time to write up an email? What if they are reviewing several files...  they could have dozens of fixes to make. Are they necessarily going to remember where and what all of those changes were? Yes, they could do diffs in source control, but again, do they have time? Also, an email out the the original author doesn't help anyone else to learn anything. I'm a big believer in learning not only from my mistakes, but also from those of others.<br><br><br><br>I think that Haacked hit the nail on the head... what we really need is a hybrid approach. So, I'll simply re-iterate his request for ideas from you, the community.</p>
