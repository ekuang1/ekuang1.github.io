message: "<p>I think that using the VS Task List is a great idea. It is the first place that I am looking for any changes, if the code is properly commented and token list is up to date. <br><br><br><br>In Open Source projects though, collective ownership is a good practice if you are sure that the fix your are applying is actually fixing the code. If you are not sure you can always use REVIEW: task. You still need to properly comment out what you did with a date signature in the code.<br><br><br><br>So, fix if you can, put your initials, a date and a small description explaining why as a comment. Also I don't think it is necessary to create a bug record and attach your changes to this bug. The best thing would be to link the change to the bug as I explained here <a href=\"http://www.analystdeveloper.com/blogs/gurkaneng/archive/2005/09/20/1465.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.analystdeveloper.com/blogs/gurkaneng/archive/2005/09/20/1465.aspx\">http://www.analystdeveloper.com/blogs/gurkaneng/archive/2005/09/20/1465.aspx</a><br><br> using bugtraq properties. It is possible with Subversion, WebSVN and TortoiseSVN</p>"
