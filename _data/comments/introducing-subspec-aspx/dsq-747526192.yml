message: <p>@Scott<br>Having used xSpec style for a time I agree with most of what you are saying. <br>However I do remember in the past you have said that people were not "getting" BDD when they were actually following closely the ideas put forward by Dan North, and that you then said that they shouldn't be expressing their views publicly. <br>I know this is a different situation but I thought I should mention that.<br><br>@Phil<br>My view is its worth trying to understand the essence of something before trying to change it, especially something that people have put a lot of work into. Maybe you've just picked context/specification up really fast and identified issues with it, in which case great and all power to you.<br>However my experience has been that in general good ideas like BDD come out in a blaze of glory but they are then quickly watered down through misunderstandings and re-definition. I think this has held back good approaches in the past, TDD/DDD/REST come to mind, which is a real pity.<br>I'm hoping this doesn't happen with BDD but I have little confidence, particularly because it's quite subtle and there is already enough confusion about how to practice it. <br>So I do wonder whether yet another approach is a good idea. I guess my question is what do you think BDD is, and what do you think the context/specification style helps with? <br>I'd also be interested in knowing whether your ideas are consistent with those of Dave Astels (including his guidelines on the last page of the PDF), if not why do you think we need another approach?<br><br>@Mihai<br>If you managed to read Dan North's thoughts and this post and put them together then that's cool. I can't do that, but then I think in general context/spec is quite different from  the BDD approach Dan North originally wrote about (as I understand it Dave Astels and Dan North just came to different conclusions as to what BDD is, which has resulted in two different directions).</p>
