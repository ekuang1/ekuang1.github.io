message: <p>@Scott I would think they would want to reap the benefits of publishing on the web, which allows them to make corrections and improvements to content. I guess it depends on how old school they are regarding publishing. But consider the fact that their web publication probably has far more reach in the long run than their print publication due to Google.</p>
