message: "<p>Mel,<br>The scenarios where you need to lay eyes on object initialization code in set setup are fewer than you might think, and frequently this need is due to a psychological fixation than a technical or cognitive necessity.<br>Well-written Context/Specification classes document and describe intent and essence.<br>If within a context that describes funds transfers I presented you with the line of code:<br>fromAccount.Transfer(2m, toAccount);<br>...you should be able to immediately grok the essence of how the API works.<br>This is written for scanning rather than reading.  Most of the time, we're scanning code, and only part of the time time we're reading code.  Creating an interactive experience that takes advantage of a predisposition to scan is an essential bit of crafting artifacts for usability.<br>There's a reason why programmers are often the creators of horrible user experience: programmers believe that people are stopping to read the artifacts that they have beneficently left behind for the world to enjoy.<br>I don't really care to \"read\" all the code I come across in a given work day.  I'm more interested in finding the work site where I need to be, and I do that by scanning.  When I arrive at the work site, I may then take a detailed read, and I want that experience to be essential and rich in order to speed my understanding first from a general perspective, and then at a more detailed perspective if I choose.<br>When we don't code for usability, we're sucking productivity out of our team mates and generating significant waste.  It's subtle waste, but it's pervasive and thus - for me - a target for optimization.<br>When you need to sit down to work on context code that hides the language ceremony behind a base class, you *may* need to read that base class, but there's not much of a safari hunt for code here.  Finding the object initialization code - the little of it that there is - doesn't require much of a user in terms of interactions with a modern editor.<br>And ultimately, if you want to show the ceremonial code inline in a context class, there's no reason that you can't, but consider the possibility that our need to see the details is only active because we are presently sitting in that class and focusing on it.  At that point in time there are thousands of other classes that we may simply need to scan.<br>When object initialization is a key part of what is being documented, I write semantically-rich factory methods that describe this significance better than raw code does in effort to yet again improve the scanability of the code.<br>The point is to communicate the essence of the API so that scanning is unencumbered by programming language ceremony and noise that isn't essential to understanding how an API works.<br>Bringing usability practices to program code isn't easy, and it's utterly counter-intuitive to most programmers.  This issue for me is the next stage of progress in agility, and it means over-coming many of the presumptions that programmers have about what goes into a good user experience - an area where programmers are inherently challenged.</p>"
