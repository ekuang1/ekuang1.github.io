message: "<p>I came here looking for some BDD guidance. Ironically, I found Scott. Scott is the type of developer I have encountered in the higher levels of development. While he blesses us with his long descent from up-high, when he arrives in our lower-reaches, we learn nothing but: you are not enlightened, you are not ready, you still have much to learn from the master. These people tend to be the roadblocks on projects I work on. You can't work with them.<br>Now maybe I can go and find some useful BDD knowledge?<br></p>"
