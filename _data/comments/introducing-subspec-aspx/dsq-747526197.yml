message: "<p>Brian,<br>&gt; Our profession revolves around the ability to learn<br>&gt; and learn quickly.<br>Our profession may revolve around the belief that this is a good way to do things, but it's merely a common way to do things... such as a common belief that the world is flat, and the predisposition to hold onto this belief long afer explorers have returned from the new world.<br>&gt; It is discouraging to want to learn TDD/BDD/etc. best<br>&gt; practices but not find any good resources easily.<br>There are different kinds of resources for different kinds of practices.  Don't expect to be able to pick up TDD like you can pick up ASP .NET.  TDD skill and fluency isn't the same kind of knowledge acquisition.<br>TDD is a practice.  You have to practice is to understand it.  Something like ASP .NET is a framework; a tangible.  With something like ASP .NET that is mostly a material concern, you can \"pick it up\".  You can't just expect to \"pick up\" TDD like you can pick up a framework.<br>Understanding first that there are different kinds of knowledge goes a long way for balancing our expectations on how long these different things should take to learn.<br>&gt; Personally, I think the best way to learn something is just<br>&gt; as Phil is doing: dive in head first, play around with it,<br>&gt; blog it, and follow the advice and links that are given by his<br>&gt; fellow readers.<br>Yes.  But it ends there.  Phil is indulging a pathological drive to change the subject matter to find his pre-conceptions rather than to give his pre-conceptions an opportunity to be changed by practice.<br>&gt; As long as he makes it clear that he is no expert in BDD,<br>&gt; no one that is truly trying to learn BDD is going to take<br>&gt; his word for the gospel.<br>That's true up until the point where he proposes alternatives to a practice that he hasn't assimilated yet.<br>If a noname blogger posted proposed alternatives to the syntaxes, then it would likely go nowhere.  With these kinds of proposed changes posted by Phil, a younger or intermediate reader will feel more confident in using these alternatives.<br>Even through claims are issued with Phil's caveat emptor, the caveat emptor's effectiveness is undone by the weight of Phil's status.  That programmer then shares the ideas with other programmers under the aegis of, \"I got it from Phil Haack's blog,\" and then we've got a misrepresentation propagation current to fight while already fighting the pathological resistance to learning practices and technique already rife in .NET community.<br>This kind of thing has been a constant thorn in my side for a good number of years in the Microsoft community.  It's part of the Microsoft pathology.</p>"
