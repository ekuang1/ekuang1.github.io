message: <p>Once again, you duck answering the relevant questions, instead taking the opportunity to lecture me on what my learning style should be, as if you know how I learn better than I do.<br>You ascribe motivations to my experimentations that only reflect your own biases. This is starting to be a pattern I see with you.<br>This is an experiment. I haven't changed anything, I've proposed alternative approaches. The feedback from the experiment provides deeper knowledge. While at the same time I continue to dive into the topic. If you think I should keep my experiments to myself, you're entitled to your opinion.<br>I feel that publishing on the web offers immediate feedback that provides a diversity of insight I won't get studying on my own. Already I've received good feedback and learned more than from simply reading various posts on the topic and from trying it out on my own.<br>Now back to my original questions:<br>Are you suggesting there's no room for improvement? Are you saying there's absolutely no merit in anything I've presented here?<br>And a new question, What do you see as the weaknesses of the current approaches out there?</p>
