message: <p>I'm not a huge fan of the syntax myself, either, but I did it for two reasons:<br>1. to test the extensibility of the <a href="http://xUnit.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="xUnit.net">xUnit.net</a> APIs<br>2. to give Phil a starting point to experiment with his own APIs<br>I'm not a BDD/Context/Spec tester myself, so I won't make any claims about what's good or bad. This is mostly a learning exercise for me about the limitations of the testing framework.<br>I am planning to take the example syntax from Machine.Specifications and see what would be involved in getting something like that to run inside of <a href="http://xUnit.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="xUnit.net">xUnit.net</a> as well.<br>I don't think Jim and I are planning to commit to any one given syntax, and will probably continue to leave examples of everything in the Samples projects rather than integrate it into <a href="http://xUnit.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="xUnit.net">xUnit.net</a> itself (or as an extension), unless the community makes a very strong statement about wanting it in.<br>By the way, Phil, we do have a few of the "should" style extensions available in our xunitext35.dll project. You should take a look at them as your starting point for your should stuff.</p>
