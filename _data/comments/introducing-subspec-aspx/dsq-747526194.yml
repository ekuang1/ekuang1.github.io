message: "<p>I just wanted to chime in and say that I appreciate Phil's post. One of the difficulties of learning less practiced software methodologies is actually finding good resources. Learning C# isn't hard because everyone blogs about it. But I'm willing to bet that 80% of developers have never heard of BDD, and most of them not even TDD. <br>Phil has a point. Our profession revolves around the ability to learn and learn quickly. It is discouraging to want to learn TDD/BDD/etc. best practices but not find any good resources easily. Personally, I think the best way to learn something is just as Phil is doing: dive in head first, play around with it, blog it, and follow the advice and links that are given by his fellow readers. As long as he makes it clear that he is no expert in BDD, no one that is truly trying to learn BDD is going to take his word for the gospel.<br>What it does do is give me and others a great launching pad to start researching. I now have a list of BDD frameworks discussed by everyone above to start researching. Plus, he has just brought BDD into the community crosshairs to some degree. Isn't that what this is all about? Improving the community?</p>"
