message: <p>Phil,<br>&gt; Try to look beyond your own biases. I know you've<br>&gt; spent a lot of time with SpecUnit.NET and have a lot<br>&gt; invested in this area. Are you suggesting there's no<br>&gt; room for improvement? I doubt that fits the Kaizen way.<br>I've got almost nothing invested in SpecUnit.NET and looking beyond my own biases was what I was doing while working with Aaron on the MSpec experience.<br>&gt; a great way to learn a new concept is to dive right<br>&gt; in and try to improve it.<br>Why not just dive right in and learn to swim first rather than assuming that the path to understanding something that you've just connected with is to change it?<br>Continuous Improvement is about a pursuit of mastery, not an impetuous indulgence in a drive for immediate cerebral and social gratification.  First shu, then ha, then ri.<br>There's more to kaizen then learning how to spell it.</p>
