message: <p>Well, I've only just read that BDD exist yesterday by pure coincidence. And today you happen to write about it :D. Although Scott is pretty rough with you he does have a point, your readers do look up to what you have to say, otherwise they wouldn't read you blog posts. And examples that contradict the "purists" are not very helpful. But I do like what I saw and there where warning signs posted all over in the article in which you specified you are not an expert in any way on the practice of BDD.<br>Also the '_' thing might not have been so bad after all, but using "strings" is always better than the first example.<br>All in all it's better to see something like your examples ( well Brad Wilson's work &gt;:) ) than the underscore porn as you called it ( =)) so funny ) that we saw at first.</p>
