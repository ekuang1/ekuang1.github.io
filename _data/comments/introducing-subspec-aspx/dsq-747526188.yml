message: <p>&gt; Are you suggesting there's no room for improvement?<br>No, I'm saying there's lots of room for improvement.  That's the whole point to the Context/Specification and Solubility efforts, and demonstrably the effort to communicate these improvements over the past couple of years.<br>&gt; Are you saying there's absolutely no merit in anything I've<br>&gt; presented here?<br>I feel that you're doing more harm than good for putting your name behind premature speculation about a practice whose finer points you haven't begun to see yet.<br>&gt; What do you see as the weaknesses of the current approaches<br>&gt; out there?<br>Two weaknesses:<br>- Excessive programmer focus on API cleverness rather than a focused study of usability, cognition, and the economics of pervasive waste.<br>- Either you've got a good programming language for BDD and a crappy mocking framework, as is the case with Ruby, or a crappy programming language and a good mocking framework, as is the case with C#.  Tools are still constraining the practice.</p>
