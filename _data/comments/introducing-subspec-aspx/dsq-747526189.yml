message: <p>I've given BDD a try all day long. Reading dan north's thoughts and to be perfectly honest I find the Specification example provided in xUnit to be exquisite. I love it. Also I haven't done BDD before so I don't have any constraints in how it should or shouldn't be. It gets the job done, no porn involved, I don't see anything but benefits.<br>What's the problem with API cleverness? Isn't the hole point focused on writing better code? If you can write less and do more I think you're one step forward.<br>I'm sure you're more qualified to answer but honestly after trying it what made you so annoyed with it ?<br>Phil thank you for your post, it helped!<br>Also, I had a lot of "Aha!" moments yesterday, and I find BDD to be exactly what I found missing or poorly explained in TDD.</p>
