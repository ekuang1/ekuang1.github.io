message: "<p>I've been working on an NUnit extension that provides BDD support.  Inspired by Jasmine for BDD (as I don't know RSpec) its pretty close to the syntax you proposed to brad.  You can have multiple describe()s per test, even nesting them freely. It is pretty solid if you don't mind using NUnit 2.5.7.  Support for other versions of NUnit (and xUnit, R#, TD.Net) are things I'd like to do, when there is time :)   <a href=\"http://www.github.com/fschwiet/dreamnjasmine\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"www.github.com/fschwiet/dreamnjasmine\">www.github.com/fschwiet/dreamnjasmine</a><br>If anyone wants to help with this, hollar.<br>(here's hoping code in comments aren't mangled)<br>public class AccountTransferTests : NJasmineFixture<br>{<br>    public override Tests() <br>    {<br>        describe(\"when a transfer is made\", delegate<br>        {<br>            var fromAccount = new Account {Balance = 1m};   <br>            var toAccount = new Account {Balance = 1m};<br>            beforeEach(delegate<br>            {<br>                fromAccount.Transfer(1m, toAccount);<br>            });<br>            it(\"should debit from account by the amount transferred\", delegate   <br>            {   <br>                fromAccount.Balance.ShouldEqual(0m);   <br>            };   <br>  <br>            it(\"should credit the to account by the amount transferred\", delegate<br>            {   <br>                toAccount.Balance.ShouldEqual(2m);   <br>            }; <br>        }<br>    }<br>}<br></p>"
