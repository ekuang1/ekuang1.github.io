message: '<p>@anon<br>Just to be clear, Dan North is talking about something different from this. I mention this not because I think either approach is superior, I actually use both, but because I think recognising the differences is the key to avoiding confusion.<br>Anyway to me if an article mentions xBehave/Acceptance Testing then it is talking about the approach Dan North describes, if it discusses TDD/xSpec/context+specification (as here) then we are probaby talking more about the approach Dave Astels (and in .NET land Scott) have been pushing for. As I say I think both are useful. <br>You might also want to look at the BDD group: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/behaviordrivendevelopment" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://groups.google.com/group/behaviordrivendevelopment">groups.google.com/group/behaviordrivendevelopment</a></p>'
