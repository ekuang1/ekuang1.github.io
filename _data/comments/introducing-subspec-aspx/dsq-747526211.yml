message: <p>While I'm killing Phil's bandwidth, I wanted to go ahead and say one more thing to demonstrate how leadership through active involvement helps others learn. <br>When MVC's preview was released, I immediately added an RSS feed to iGoogle for the MVC forums on <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a>. A poster above, tgmdbm, has been actively involved in those forums since day one - his name appeared in every other topic I read. He has influenced a lot of my learning of MVC. I can't tell you his first name, where he works, or even provide a blog (which is a shame), but the majority of what he said resonated with me. <br>I didn't follow his advice blindly, but rather prototyped a few things he discussed. Through his leadership, I picked up MVC in no time and while I still have many things to learn, his involvement has helped at least one member of the community use better practices.<br>He's not famous at all to my knowledge (yet ;) ), but he is an example of what is right with the Microsoft community. It is all about learning and sharing and nothing about status.<br>I don't think I'm alone (I hope not), and I know that the majority of the people reading this blog are intelligent enough to understand a disclaimer and not accept everything said as best practice.</p>
