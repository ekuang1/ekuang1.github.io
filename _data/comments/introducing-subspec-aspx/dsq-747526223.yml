message: <p>Scott, you must be the most opinionated person I have ever read. The most annoying thing is that you are a smart opinionated person, which means you just keep coming back with more opinion no matter what the reply... you're just making a loud buzzing sound now which is annoying. This short foray out of your ivory tower must have exhausted you by now, so go back there now. Thanks.<br>Microsoft is now involved in the community and we love it. There is immense value in what Phil is doing here, it encourages the sort of feedback which is difficult to get going otherwise, and that benefits ALL.</p>
