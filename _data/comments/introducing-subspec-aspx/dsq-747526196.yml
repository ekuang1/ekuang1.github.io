message: <p>Mihai,<br>&gt; What's the problem with API cleverness? Isn't the hole<br>&gt; point focused on writing better code?<br>No.  It's actually a common antipattern that often leads to an incredible amount of waste.<br>&gt; If you can write<br>&gt; less and do more I think you're one step forward.<br>Only under the right conditions.  Reduction of lines of code isn't a stable indicator or cause of productivity or effectiveness.</p>
