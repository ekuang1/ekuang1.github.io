message: <p>@Scott<br>"I look forward to talking with Dan in person more about this, and I hope that he makes it to the Continuous Improvement conference and that we get a chance to have a high bandwidth dialog."<br>If he does you'll have to tape it, will make good viewing. Kinda a pity the discussions on the BDD group have calmed down recently, hopefully it'll all kick off again at some point.<br><br>"In respect to Dan, I call the specific practice that I'm using and teaching, "Context/Specification" so as to try to not collude the namespace and obstruct learning."<br>Yeah I like that a lot, makes a big difference.</p>
