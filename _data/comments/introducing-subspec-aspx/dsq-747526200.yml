message: <p>Colin,<br>&gt; However I do remember in the past you have said that people<br>&gt; were not "getting" BDD when they were actually following<br>&gt; closely the ideas put forward by Dan North, and that you<br>&gt; then said that they shouldn't be expressing their views publicly.<br>My disagreement with Dan North's proposal is in the clear and public.  I don't agree with the ceremony of the grammars that he proposed, but I agree with the methodology, expect for the belief that BDD should be restrictively applied at the outer layers of an app.<br>I believe that what Dan came up with represents a watershed moment and a tipping point, but I believe that his perspective on specifics in implementation is influenced by an attachment to a particular framework.<br>I look forward to talking with Dan in person more about this, and I hope that he makes it to the Continuous Improvement conference and that we get a chance to have a high bandwidth dialog.<br>In respect to Dan, I call the specific practice that I'm using and  teaching, "Context/Specification" so as to try to not collude the namespace and obstruct learning.</p>
