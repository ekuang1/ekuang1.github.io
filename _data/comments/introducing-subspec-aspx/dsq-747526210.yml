message: <p>@Scott<br>Funny thing... I went to your blog just to read up on what you are posting these days, and I realized that you don't allow comments? Maybe I just couldn't find them easily. At any rate, not allowing comments on your blog *combined* with the way you have been coming off on this post presents the notion that you are the authority on X technology (BDD) and that no one knows as much as yourself. I feel as though you want to prevent learning through discussion, and quite honestly it is a big turn off for me personally. <br>I know for a fact that you are much more experienced than I in programming as a whole. Instead of blasting others for not understanding the technologies well enough, why not step up to the plate and show us the light. What resources do you recommend for adventurous developers? <br>To me, there is no reason that Phil as a Microsoft employee, or Rob Connery, or anyone else considered "famous" shouldn't be allowed to express their ideas freely on the internet. I mean, go back and re-read this post. It is absolutely littered with disclaimers and there are 20+ comments below stating their opinions (disagreements) on his direction.<br>I find it ironic that Microsoft is blasted for lack of community involvement when I feel that Phil, Rob, etc. are doing their damnedest to be involved. One of the things that I really dig about these guys is that they are <strong>modest</strong> and don't claim to be the authority on much really, but rather that they are trying to learn new technologies and methodologies like the rest of us - helping the Microsoft community learn in the process. That is leadership. Banning people from carrying an open discussion on your own blog is not.<br>I think we as a community need to find ways to lower the barrier to entry into new methodologies instead of just saying "you can't just 'pick it up'". IMO, blogging about your learning is a logical step. The more blogs about BDD that are out there, the easier it will be for others to learn it. Sure, there are going to be some bad practices blogged about, but typically the comments section of the blog is where you can read the community's thoughts on your views.<br>/catches breath<br>While I partially understand your point of view about Phil possibly leading others in the wrong direction, I disagree wholeheartedly... and this is why:<br>If no-name blogger decides to write a post about BDD and I, average Joe, stumble upon it, odds are he doesn't have much viewership and certainly not many comments on his approach. This may lead me and others I'm close to down the wrong path.<br>On the other hand, if Phil writes a blog about the same topic and others disagree, his massive viewership will reflect their disagreement in the comments... you know, offering other view points, other resources, etc.<br>Come on man, lighten up. Let's figure out how we, as a community, can move forward in sharing methodologies that make our jobs easier and <em>get us home sooner</em>.</p>
