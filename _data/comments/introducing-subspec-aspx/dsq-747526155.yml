message: <p>Phill,<br>Good to see you picking up some of the Context/Specification stuff.<br>It looks like you've begun to make changes to things that you haven't quite yet got a good understanding of yet.<br>Your examples are representative of biases of the Fixture per Class xUnit pattern.  You haven't given yourself enough time to see Context/Specification without the powerful influence of these long-healed biases influencing your perception.<br>I don't think that it's such a positive thing to express these alternatives yet as your obvious leadership position in the community can be taken by your readers to mean that experience and insight into Context/Specification is in play here.<br>I understand that you've stated clearly that you're proposing theoretical syntax and grammars, but having published alternate syntax and grammar as Phill Haack will inevitably mean that others who have not yet invested enough time to grok the reason for the grammar may by diverted from a course of practice that will lead to more readily to understanding.<br>Why not practice the forms, gain some fluency in them, and THEN innovate?  You don't have to behave like a Microsoft Program Manager all the time :)<br>P.S.  That RSpec spec is a clusterf*ck.  I wouldn't propose it as a good example of Context/Specification as much as it is an example of the RSpec API.  It's still legal and functional RSpec, but it's not representative of the intentions of Context/Specification.</p>
