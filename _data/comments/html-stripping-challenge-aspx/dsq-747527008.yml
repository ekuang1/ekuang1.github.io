message: <p>Anyone care to extend this regex to include support for excluding tags from being stripped?<br><code><br>public static string StripHtml(string html, params string[] exclusions)<br></code><br>...would be the signature. This would return the string with all tags stripped <strong>except</strong> those defined in the exclusions array.<br>Been trying to work on this one and it's giving me a bit of trouble.</p>
