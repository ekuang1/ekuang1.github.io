message: <p>I've been thinking about this for what ever reason.  I still going to recommend doing it yourself.  Here's why.  For software developers there is nothing more important then your code repository.  It is your life blood.<br><br><br><br>Because of this, no matter who you go with, you'll probably want to do your own backups, just to be sure.  If you've already gone that far, you might as well host the box as well, which in the long run will be far cheaper, and faster.  <br><br><br><br>I think the decision to use Vault or some other system is really secondary to the hosting decision.  <br><br><br><br>The only way I would allow someone else to manage my repository is if I knew them personally, and could meet them face to face if they lost my data.  <br><br><br><br></p>
