message: <p>I've had bad experience with <a href="http://1and1.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="1and1.com">1and1.com</a> support. I've called them in the past regarding SSL certificates and to ask them about certain directive settings in their PHP support and they don't seem to know their product very well. The connection was pretty bad on the phone too (probably outsourced support). On the plus side they're cheap and have lots of features so if you're a computer techie by nature you can usually get by without support.</p>
