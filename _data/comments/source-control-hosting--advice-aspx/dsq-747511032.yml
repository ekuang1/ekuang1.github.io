message: <p>I'm using a colo service up here in Reno called <a href="http://www.hostrack.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.hostrack.net/">http://www.hostrack.net/</a>.  They are fairly cheap, but their service is only mediocre.  <br><br><br><br>A friend of mine was just pricing out hosting in SF.  I can't remember what he came up with though.  Seemed like it was on par price was.</p>
