message: <p>I'm personally a huge fan of Subversion.  I reviewed Vault, and even tried to get Eric to drop his price, but in the end I went with subversion, and I couldn't be happier.  It works with windows and Unix equally well.  Support is awesome.  One time I wanted a script written in python, and I got one of the developers to write it for a very fair price.  It was far less than what Eric would have charged I'm sure.  <br><br><br><br>We also seriously considered using Vault at work, but ended up going with Perforce, but that is probably overkill unless you have 5+ developers on the project.<br><br><br><br>As far as hosting it.  If you are serious about going your own, I would recommend getting a colo box.  I messed around with a bunch of shared hosting environments, but I think in the end doing it yourself is the best way to go.</p>
