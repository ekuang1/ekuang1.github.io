message: <p>Hi Phil,<br><br><br><br>I'd like to chime in on hosting providers. I just started a project with a couple of remote colleagues, and we went with 1and1 (<a href="http://1and1.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="1and1.com">1and1.com</a>). I just siged up for a dedicated server solution for $129/month and got a 3GHz box, 1GB memory, 120GB disk space and the ability to RDP to the box and manage anything I want.<br><br><br><br>I have several friends who are professional developers who have gone with these guys for this solution and have been very pleased. They also respond very quickly to email when you need assistance, which is rare these days.<br><br><br><br>Good luck!<br><br><br><br>Chris</p>
