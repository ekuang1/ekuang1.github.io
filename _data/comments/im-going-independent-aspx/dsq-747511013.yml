This one sucks for you. You need to get a couple of people under your coporation and do it a group insurance.  If you don't you will probably get screwed.  If you don't do a Group insurance and if you have had ANY problems with your health (even ear aches), they will deny you health insurance.  They will provide you an alternate plan that is twice as much.<br><br><br><br>If you need a person to help you get insurance I can forward you our guy.  He is great.  He also set up our Pension plan.<br><br><br><br>Niels</p>
