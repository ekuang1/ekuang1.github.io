message: <p>I noticed an extremely similar article this week in Harvard<br>Business Review. That forum is just the simplest of articles for struggling mid-level managers who are hungry for outside inspiration. If you work for a modern, distributed, multinational, multi-timezone, information management organization whose productivity is not measured by the time of the email response, than good for you.  The HBR article does not address your organization.</p><p>In my opinion, both you and the HBR author failed to see the<br>bigger problem.</p><p>I take issue with your idea that managers are just "one of the guys"; we are just like you; cut us some slack; we are trying our<br>best; letâ€™s all cooperate and graduate! Management has its own skills (mostly communication), just like programming, database management, heart surgery, brick laying.  I don't care what you used to do, you took the job and the paycheck. I expect managers to be able to communicate integrated, organized concepts, with disciplined explanations of task, purpose, method, and endstate. Explain to me in clear language, diagrams and calendars, what the organization needs. If it is not worth your time to take the 12 seconds for a word processor's grammar check, I get the awkward feeling that your 11 pm, 15 word email from your cell phone redirecting next week's meeting was not deliberative; maybe you had multiple beers and a conversation with your brother-in-law.  I work for an organization where managers are chosen based upon their knowledge of the task at hand, their familiarity with the organization, their ability to get along with other managers, their previous good conduct, and their "general character". I would so much rather work for the unapproachable grumps from a previous organization who organized their thoughts before communicating, and who held other managers to that standard.</p>
