message: <p>As a manager myself, I want to share a different side of things. When I send and email off-hours, it is usually because I'm catching up on things and need to get either a question sent out or info provided while I'm thinking about it so people will see it when they normally come online, NOT to ask for an immediate reply. Email is NOT a medium for immediate turnaround at all hours.</p>
