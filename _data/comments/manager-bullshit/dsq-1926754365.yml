message: <p>Unfortunately not all teams are the same, and not all companies are the same..<br>The advice applies especially where 20 developers and one 'big' manager (read boss/company owner) work in the same physical office, often 10-12 hours/day, but the manager sends an "urgent" email at 23:00 o'clock just because.. :)</p>
