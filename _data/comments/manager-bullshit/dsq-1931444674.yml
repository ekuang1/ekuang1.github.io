message: <p>I think most management advice treats symptoms and not diseases.  If your people feel anxiety about receiving late night emails, then you're not creating the right team dynamic.</p><p>I'm not saying that your employees should expect to be dragged into a work discussion anytime and anywhere.  I'm saying that you have to ask yourself why your employees are feeling anxiety.  If you have created a culture where employees are admonished for not responding to bone-headed late-night emails, then you are the problem... not your emails.</p><p>I get late-night emails and I send some, too.  But, I try to preface them with, "Here's a thought I had to jot down, let's talk about this tomorrow."    And then the next day I will make it clear that my late-night ramblings are not priorities... and real priorities would have been made over the phone.</p><p>If people understand their value and that they are appreciated, it's not hard to keep them from feeling job-related anxiety.</p>
