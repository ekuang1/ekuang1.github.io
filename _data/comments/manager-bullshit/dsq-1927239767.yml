message: <p>I think it's a great point. If you're a good manager, then this isn't a problem and your staff will understand that an email sent at midnight (their time) can wait until some time more proximate to working hours.</p><p>Sadly, the reason you see this advice has nothing to do with good managers being seen as demigods, but is given as a reaction to those managers who DO feel like the email they sent you at midnight, or 9 pm on a Saturday, merits an immediate response and then chews you butt out when you come in on Monday.</p><p>Luckily, I've not had any of these, but my friends have, and I just shake my head.</p>
