message: <p>Indeed. What it boils down to is the notion that the manager "deserves" on-call status for free. Sort of like refusing to buy a warranty and then complaining when you have to cover repair costs when something breaks. I have noticed the managers that do this are indignant and dismissive if you point out that what they are expecting is a paid status.</p>
