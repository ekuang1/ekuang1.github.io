message: <p>Yep, that's the best strategy for work life balance. Unfortunately, too many will pressure employees to break the work life balance, such as asking why someone doesn't set up work email on their personal phone. I had a supervisor pull that on a coworker and get told, very reasonably, that since she wasn't going to be reimbursed for the internet use or after hours responses, she didn't want to. He kept bringing it up until she eventually gave in. He was a particularly poor supervisor, but most managers in professional fields push for it in some way. </p>
