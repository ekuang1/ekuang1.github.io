message: <p>I like the idea that my manager will be active on email all day long. I don't feel like that obligates me to be online all the time. But I do know that if I am working at weird hours (and since my manager and I are three time zones apart, that's reasonably likely), he'll be able to help me if I need him for something.</p><p>Not that I expect him to, but when he does I see it as a good thing.</p><p>The problem isn't when managers send emails. The problem is the culture and expectations set by the manager. If the manager is setting explicit positive expectations, things like the 10pm email fit into that framework. But if the manager is not setting expectations or setting negative ones (like it's more about attendance than consistent baseline productivity), then the 10pm email feeds into that negativity or ambiguity.</p>
