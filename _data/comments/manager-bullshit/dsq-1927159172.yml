message: <p>The advice doesn't fit your specific case, but the majority of English speaking managers who might read such advice are managing people who they are within the same time zone, and mostly in the same building. Even in the modern era, non-local teams are the exception, not the rule.</p><p>And the advice is accurate. When I get an email from my supervisor or the director, my expectation is that they are wanting me to drop what I'm doing and do something about the email immediately. It becomes a clear breech of work life balance when that is reinforced by comments or complaints when I don't get the email for a while.</p><p>There is also a problem with the date you give. Email at home was a non issue until the mid 2000s when cell phones with email capability became common. The issue of email after hours arises from the expectations of immediacy.</p><p>Finally, advice isn't an expectation that you be perfect, it's an optional thing you can try to improve how you do your job. There are managers who pay attention to the time zone of their employees with no issues, but that doesn't mean you have to, just because it works for other people. </p>
