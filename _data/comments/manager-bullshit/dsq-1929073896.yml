message: <p>I think most of this general management advice isn't really geared toward our industry... otherwise it would have the word 'agile', 'mobile', or 'cloud' somewhere in it ;-).  I think software developers aren't upset when they get an e-mail from their boss late at night in the same way that a non-software person might be.  In our world, it's sort of implied that we should prioritize what just came in with whatever else we're working on.  In other fields it's not always as clear cut.</p>
