message: <p>Even so, I think Dennett's approach works well. At least you can quickly determine using this approach if the other person is interested in a good argument.</p><p>Often, I find what when I characterize the other person as someone who's not interested in logic, *I'm* the one who's lost out because I've already given up on learning anything from the other person. Characterizing the other person as illogical should only happen after going through the process.</p>
