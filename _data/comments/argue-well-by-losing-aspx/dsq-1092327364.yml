message: <p>Great write-up. I agree that most arguments boil down to value preferences, such as prioritizing fairness vs equality (they are different), loyalty vs pragmatism, community vs self... I've found that people are rarely willing/able to alter their values after a single argument/discussion (myself included). Values are things that we carry with us for years if not decades. We continually, almost unconsciously, rely on them on decisions big and small. We credit them with our successes to constantly revalidate and reinforce our belief in them (thanks you, confirmation bias). A logical argument about a particular decision cannot unearth decades of "evidence" supporting a foundational belief; cognitive dissonance can be resolved by simply rationalizing the immediate evidence/case as a fluke, an exception to the rule.</p><p>Still, logical, patient argument is worthwhile for immediate decisions. And, when sustained, can unseat strongly-held foundational beliefs. I think the best one can hope for in an argument that collegially escalates to a values discussion is for one (or both) sides to signal open-mindedness, "Hmm, well, I'll think about it."</p><p>But I could be wrong. I'll think about it.</p>
