message: "<p>Your 3 points of difference are rather interesting, but in my experience the first 2 are transient: i.e. if they are the root of the difference of opinion then if the argument stays rational long enough then the unknown will become apparent and the opinions will become conditional or the logic error will become clear then be dealt with.</p><p>The third possibility (a value difference) on the other hand is more permanent. I've been in a few good arguments (ironical, the one that comes to mind was a tangent from gender equality) that bottomed out on that sort of issue and the term \"axiomatic\" came to mind as a good way to describe the difference.</p>"
