message: <p>There is something fundamentally wrong with this line of reasoning, the shyness away from truth.  The argument has sidestepped this by mentioning a third party called "the facts" which is never explained, just assumed.</p><p>The facts assume a foundation of truth formed by ones belief on what gives authority to the facts. If two people stand on different foundations, then the "three reasons reasonably smart people would argue" will not hold in its entirety.</p><p>What makes an argument interesting is to lead one another into breaking down each other's reasoning and revealing that foundation.</p>
