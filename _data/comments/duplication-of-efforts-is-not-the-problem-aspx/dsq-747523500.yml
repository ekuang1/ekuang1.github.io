message: <p>"For example, whether we like it or not, some companies wonâ€™t use open source software."<br>Man, I hate hearing that from softies - yep, you get all the blame now too, Phil ;)<br>Microsoft created the FUD within those companies that caused them to take that stance. <br>All it would take for those companies to use open source software would be Microsoft saying (via all literature, consultants, etc) something like "We STRONGLY recommend you use a DI framework. We do not offer a DI framework ourselves, but both StructureMap and Windsor are very good tools that we use (we dont endorse one specifically, but will leave it up to your evaluation)." I bet every one of those companies would use a piece of open source software.</p>
