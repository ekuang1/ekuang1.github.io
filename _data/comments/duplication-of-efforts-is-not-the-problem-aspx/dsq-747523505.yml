message: "<p>&gt; we're all hoping that the path that the MVC framework team took <br>&gt; is not the exception, and it becomes the rule<br>Heh heh. Me too. Right now, the MVC framework is in my \"sphere of influence\" so I can't speak for other teams. But my hope is that the success of it and the attention it draws is noticed by other teams.<br>I understand the frustration that Microsoft doesn't seem to mention other frameworks. It <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/04/ExtremeProgramming/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"Testing article covers NUnit\">has happened before</a>, so it's not a case that OSS is *never* mentioned. Of course, the example I provided is by an OSS perso hired by MS. ;)<br>At least with the MVC framework, a key goal is to highlight alternatives. We point out that you can swap out any piece you don't like. We have and will continue to make mention of alternative template engines: NVelocity, Brails, etc...<br>Also, we don't ship a DI container with MVC, instead suggesting people try the perfectly good ones out there: Spring.NET, StructureMap, Castle Windsor. I've seen samples built with all three.<br>I think we'll continue to see improvement in this area. Also, be sure to check out the <a href=\"http://port25.technet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"Port 25 at MS\">Port 25</a>. That's a group at Microsoft dedicated to promoting .NET OSS and interoperability with non-.NET OSS, which I think has been a force in this change.<br>So while many complain that Microsoft never mentions OSS alternatives, Port 25 has been preaching the gospel. Help a brotha out by contributing to their message. Get involved, tell them when they're wrong or right, etc... Comment on their posts so they get involved in the right places.</p>"
