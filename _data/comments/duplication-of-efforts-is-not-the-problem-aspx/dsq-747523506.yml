message: <p>Port 25 is part of the problem that I was raising. Why does there have to be an "open source ghetto" in the form of Port 25? Why can't all Microsoft content, evangelists, consultants, etc speak the good word?<br>"If you want Microsoft's guidance, go to MSDN."<br>"If you want Microsoft's other guidance geared specifically to satisfy people that like open source software, go to Port 25"</p>
