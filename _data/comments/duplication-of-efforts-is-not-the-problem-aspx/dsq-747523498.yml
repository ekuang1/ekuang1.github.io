message: <p>I think Oren's explanation made it clear that it wasn't just the duplication of effort that was the problem (even if that is how he originally stated it).<br>For those justifying it as capitalism - why would Microsoft want to treat their most active members of their community as competition that needs to be defeated? Remember, these are the people that are volunteering their free time to make your (Microsoft's) development platform more livable.<br></p>
