message: <p>I think the primary justification is simply that many companies will not install or use OSS software or software that does not look mature. One of the aspects of OSS projects that also makes it hard to justify to the stakeholders are the versioning schedules used by OOS projects. You do not know when the next update is coming or what will be included with it. I also find that many OSS projects do not have great documentation which hurts adoption.<br>As far as duplication of effort, that point seems to now be a secondary concern. But to put it into a larger context, consider that .NET was created because MS could not reshape Java to suit their needs. And other projects like Parrot have been created to provide a runtime for multiple languages much like the .NET runtime.<br><a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.parrotcode.org/">http://www.parrotcode.org/</a><br>These are duplicate efforts to a degree but they serve a specific purpose. What I do hope that MS/.NET avoids is a fragmentation where there are 15 web frameworks for .NET like there is for Java which makes it very hard to maintain any expertise with that platform for web development. One aspect that I have liked about MSTest, NUnit, and MBunit is the fact that they all essentially have the same interface so switching between them has not been hard. I just change the using/imports statements and rename the attributes and I am back up and running. We should be so lucky for switching out projects like Monorail and ASP.NET for MVC, but the complexity there may be too much to make it possible.<br>This is a good discussion regardless. The focus should be kept on how the OSS community and MS can collaborate to improve the .NET development experience.</p>
