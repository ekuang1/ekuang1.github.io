message: <p>Well wouldn't that make Port 25 a symptom of the problem and not part of the problem? It's like saying a band-aid is part of the problem. No, the fact I need a band-aid is a problem. It means I probably have a cut. But a band-aid is part of the solution. If I could avoid getting cut in the first place, that's even better.</p>
