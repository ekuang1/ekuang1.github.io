message: "<p>I don't have that much problem with duplication, what I *DO* have a problem with is that Microsoft makes no mention -- does not even acknowledge the existence -- of any of these other options.  By way of comparison, you/SubText, DasBlog, Rhino.Mocks, etc all make references to other frameworks in their documentation or on their blog.  Microsoft, as far as I've seen, NEVER does this. If I didn't read blogs, I would have no idea that most of these things even exist.<br>It's concerning that Microsoft created .NET and opened it up considerably and encouraged people to build things on it, but then snubs the things built on it unless you're from one of the Big Customers (Dell, etc).  I would think that Microsoft would want to PROMOTE things like Mono, Rhino.Mocks, NUnit, Spring.NET, etc as examples of how Open and Developer-Friendly (yes, even smelly basement-dweller Open Source developers!) .NET is.<br>If Microsoft chooses to create Yet Another IoC Container (because some of their customers can't use OSS or whatever reason), that's fine. But do so HUMBLY and with ACKNOWLEDGMENT that there are several other, more mature, frameworks out there already that might be better at the current time.<br>Give people the choice by making them aware of the alternatives. Microsoft isn't going to lose money by promoting the wonderful ecosystem of development they have helped create in the .NET world.<br>One last point: I love Microsoft for creating .NET. I just wish they'd give it more of a chance because it seems they're hell-bent on ruining it with marketing and snuffing out the light of innovation that .NET has sparked!</p>"
