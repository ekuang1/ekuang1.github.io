message: <p>@Joshua, I don't see it that way. Change doesn't happen overnight. Port 25 is a foot in the door. An agent of change. Hopefully, with support, change spreads.<br>But bashing them and saying "why doesn't everybody get it?!" doesn't help the situation. Everybody doesn't get it yet. So we need to get and support footholds and spread the love, rather than scorning those who do get it and are trying to change their organization from within because their organization doesn't get it.<br>It's like any project, keep the end goal in mind, but focus on the next milestone.</p>
