message: <p>Let me clarify - I was not trying to bash the good people at Port 25. They are doing good work, and I definitely appreciate the challenges of trying to change a large organization from within.<br>When I said "Port 25 is part of the problem", I meant "the fact that Microsoft needs to pigeonhole people with those ideas" is the problem - not the actual work they are doing.</p>
