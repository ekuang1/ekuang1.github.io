message: <p>What about the GPL and other license requirements on disclosing code when redistributing software using OSS? Companies shouldn't feel obligated to reveal proprietary source because they want to use OSS, and MS gives them that comfort.<br>If Microsoft is promoting and recommending software, their customers might take that as a cue that it's ok to include it in their projects without upholding their end of the bargain when they decided to incorporate open source.</p>
