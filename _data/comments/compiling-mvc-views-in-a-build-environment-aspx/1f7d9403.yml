message: 'People may find it confusing that MvcBuildViews does not actually compile views. What it actually does is add views to the build process in order to find compile-time mistakes. There is no build output. To actually precompile views, you should set PrecompileBeforePublish to true in your publish profile. Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49042868/825011'
