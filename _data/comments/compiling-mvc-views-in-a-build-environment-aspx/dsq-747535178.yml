message: <p>This is the area which is somehow neglected - automated builds. You have created many awesome tools recently - MVC Scaffolding, Web Publishing mechanisms, etc., but they all so Visual Studio IDE-centric! (Scott Guthrie promised a post about automation but never did one). How can I leverage all this goodness in the Continuous Integration (and not only TFS, but Team City/NAnt for example)?</p>
