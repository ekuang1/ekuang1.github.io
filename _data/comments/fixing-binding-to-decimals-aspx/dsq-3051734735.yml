message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Regarding this note:</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>In general, we recommend folks don’t write custom model binders because they’re difficult to get right and they’re rarely needed. The issue I’m discussing in this post might be one of those cases where it’s warranted.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Have you changed your mind about this one? or do you still think in the same way after 5 years of software evolution?</p><p>Please, I'm being constructive, don't get me wrong, I think now days this is changing, right? if so, maybe it's time to put a note behind,</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Manuel</p>
