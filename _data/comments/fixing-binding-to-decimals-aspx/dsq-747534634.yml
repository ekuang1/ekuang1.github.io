message: <p>I'm working on a website that has two cultures (en-GB and nl-NL) and I don't have any problems with Decimal Model Binding. <br>Maybe it's because I set the Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  and Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture to the culture that is used for the form input?<br>When the form is Dutch (nl-NL) they are set to {nl} and {nl-NL}, and when the form is English they are set to {en} and {en-GB}.</p>
