message: <p>Great April Fools Post!! <br>All kidding aside, the MIT license is just such an OSS license where open source can find its way to closed source/proprietary projects. It's precisely why jQuery is dual licensed under the MIT and the GPL. It facilitates companies like Telerik to issue proprietary licenses on their MVC extensions. It also makes open source feasable to those companies who wish to remain on a closed source track.</p>
