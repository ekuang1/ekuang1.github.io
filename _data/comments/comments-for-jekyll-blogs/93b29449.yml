  i had tried integrating twitter discussions on my blog, but then someone deleted a reply and then i deleted a root tweet (by accident) and it broke the whole discussion. i think there may be a hybrid version as balance, using a twitter integration as a temporary discussion, and then once-a-week automatically convert all of them into static comments for your site.





  im still not convinced twitter is the best platform to host a conversation for a blog post, but it's worth exploring
