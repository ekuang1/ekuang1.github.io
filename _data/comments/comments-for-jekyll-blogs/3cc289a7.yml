message: Phil, nice to run into you again. I have been a silent follower of your content back in my .NET days. I had to double check to see if was the same person but how many Haacks are there? Anyhow, I'm investigating the same solution for my Hugo blog which led me to your article. I do like the pull-request idea of Staticman but wish it was more comprehensive and supported Bitbucket. I'm seriously thinking about scratching this itch myself. How big do you believe the need is out there?
