  This seems like a big security hole. You're creating pull-requests out of user data and as evidenced by a pull-request currently there it will display pictures embedded in the post. I can already think of a couple ways to make this go badly.



  At the very least the Pull Request comment should not include the message. Although now I think about it I should go find the repo for the comment system and post that there.
