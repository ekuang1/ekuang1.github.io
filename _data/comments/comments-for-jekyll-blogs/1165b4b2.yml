  I've evaluated a lot of different comment systems for static blogs: https://darekkay.com/blog/static-site-comments/



  As you want to utilize GitHub, you might also want to try StaticMan or Gitment. But if you stick to your solution instead, feel free to make a quick update in a few months about your lessons learned (how well does it work? is the spam really manageable? etc.)
