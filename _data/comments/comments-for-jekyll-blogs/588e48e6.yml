  The whole point of having the comment and avatar in the PR comment is so I can review it before I merge it into my blog. I could omit the comment from the PR, but it's still visible in a direct link to the yml file.

  I think a lot of folks who implement such a comment system will have their blog repositories be private. I think the issue I'm running into is I _want_ my blog repository to be public so people can submit fixes.



  One thing I could do is have comments go to a private fork of my repo and then I merge in comments after reviewing them.
