  @grok I haven't added any automatic filtering. Right now, it's moderated by the fact that every comment becomes a pull request on the GitHub repository that hosts my Jekyll based blog.



  For example, here's the pull request for your comment: https://github.com/Haacked/haacked.com/pull/419



  So it is moderated because if a comment is spam, I just close it instead of merging it.
