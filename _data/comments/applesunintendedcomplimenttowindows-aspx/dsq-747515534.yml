message: <p>Funny.<br>I agree Seth's article in Slate [ <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2143810" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2143810">http://www.slate.com/id/214...</a> ] - this particular ad is takes some credibility from the campaign. Anyone who's slightly computer saavy would know that in general Windows supports more hardware than Mac. That's a blessing and a curse - it's part of the reason that Microsoft takes so much longer to ship new versions of Windows, and often the cause of crashes in Windows.<br>Also, that hip slacker guy bugs me. He seems like a guy that would screw up my latte order and claim it was my fault. They should have picked a less likable nerd than John Hodgman.</p>
