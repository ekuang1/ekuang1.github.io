message: <p>Even though I know PC is the term for common ibm based personal computers... this commercial is technically wrong.<br>PC = Personal Computer<br>The Apple //c was a personal computer...<br>and now more than ever Apple sells PCs (Intel architecture)<br>They should've gone right ahead and said it...<br>"I am Windows"<br>The fault of a machine getting viruses, being slow, and buggy as hell is not the hardware, it's windows, otherwise they wouldn't have gone with intel.<br></p>
