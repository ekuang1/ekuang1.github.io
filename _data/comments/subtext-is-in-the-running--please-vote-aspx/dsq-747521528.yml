message: <p>Well, you can have my vote in theory. Unfortunately I, and probably <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000881.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000881.html">Jeff</a>, will not be among those actually casting votes.<br>If I get a little more time later, I will probably go through the whole Forgot Password-&gt;Reset Password-&gt;Forget Password Again cycle.<br>I think it's probably right that only registered members can cast votes, but I visit Sourceforge so infrequently (as infrequently as I can possibly manage, tbh) that I wouldn't even begin to guess at my password.<br>Good luck, though!<br>Carl</p>
