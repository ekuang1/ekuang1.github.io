message: <p>Sadly, this problem (the client banning OS) is entirely due to ignorance and generalizations made about Open Source that are usually only attributable to the GPL specifically. The GPL and its variants and the paranoid reading of these licenses by "in-house counsel" (read, "can't make it practicing law on my own, so I work at a company who wants cheap advice and doesn't want to pay for anything else"). Blame this scenario on the GPL and stupid lawyers.</p>
