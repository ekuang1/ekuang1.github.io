message: <p>The licenses used by Microsoft are usually BSD/Apache/MIT style, that enable commercial derived works. Take the library, re-release it under a commercial license (which the original license allows, if I'm not mistaken), sell them for an outrageous price what they could have for free. In other words, make them pay for their stupidity. Problem solved.</p>
