message: <p>I think you're right in focusing on the licensing issues. The major fears I've seen organisations have with open source, is fear of doing something wrong in the licensing jungle and the fear of the project getting abandoned. The licensing thing I can definitely understand - I have used open source for more than 10 years and do not even know the details of the different licenses. And even more, there has been some FUD-campaigning that said "if you use open source, youhave to open source your own project" - and risking losing control of your expensive software can keep any CIO awake at night I guess. The other problem with the risk of abandon-ware exists even for payware, and payware does not allow you to keep maintaining it yourself. So perhaps the "clients" in Phils post should be educated more to help them overcome (most of) the fears they have with open source software.</p>
