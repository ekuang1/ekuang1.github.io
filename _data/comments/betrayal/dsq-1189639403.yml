message: <p>Love the points you expound on here Phil. I would extend it further to say that betrayal is driven by a change. As you say, this change can be "bad" or "good" and most folks feel betrayed when they feel that the change affects them negatively. I personally think that the steps Microsoft are taking are good and moving Microsoft in a positive and exciting direction.</p><p>Like it or not we're in an industry of constant flux and it's my opinion that if you have time to get hung up on changes you feel affect you negatively rather than adapting to them you will fall behind very quickly. Technology's half-life is short enough that if you feel like you were betrayed by a change it won't be too long before you can influence the next one. It's one of the great things about being in the industry we're in.</p>
