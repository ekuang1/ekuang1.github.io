message: <p>Well said Phil.</p><p>There's an odd implication in the developer's message that the client feels that changing the license from closed to open source somehow changes the quality, reliability or security of the software. If that is indeed true, it's often the case that these things change for the _better_ when made open source, especially when things are loved as much as Rx is.</p><p>Let's hope these devs are able to educate their clients or find others that aren't quite so "stuck in their ways".</p>
