message: <p>Thank you, Judah, for pointing out "the myth."  Galileo wasn't wrong in his science but his work was incomplete, certainly far short of the threshold required to invoke the Augustinian reference to which Pope John Paul II was making reference.  Galileo ran afoul of the Church because he was trying to dictate theology.  Chapter 5 of this book by Tom Woods -- <a href="http://amzn.com/1596983280" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://amzn.com/1596983280">http://amzn.com/1596983280</a> -- goes into great detail (more so than any other book I've seen) on this topic.</p>
