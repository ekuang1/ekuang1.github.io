message: <p>I don't know if you have realised this, but software engineering is a competitive sport. So, if we don't do what the customer wants, then the customer will go elsewhere, and I, with my high progressive principles and modern viewpoint and education, will be out of a job. JDT in the original comment wants some assurance that there will be some consultation and notice before he is placed in such a legally vulnerable position, is what I got from it.</p>
