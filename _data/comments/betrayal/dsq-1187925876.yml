message: <p>I think It's has nothing to do with quality or progress.<br>It's just that before you could use product X in your application and now you can't.<br>Think about this case:<br>You have been using an open source product from company X and then suddenly they changed the license and now you can't use it. <br>I know would feel betrayed...<br>And as for 'educating the client'.. my client (i.e. the IT person in the department that ordered my product) agrees the guidelines are stupid but unfortunately they have to follow guidelines set by the government and good luck trying to educate them...<br>And as for billing the for changing client (a many figure estimate, no less) for changing the libraries... as far as my client is concerned - why should he pay extra if the libraries I picked no longer fit is requirements? I wish I had customers that would pay for extra work like this...<br>So yes, I will adapt, but don't expect me to like it when other companies decide for me when and what to adapt...<br>Just because a framework or license is better does not mean that I want or CAN change my application to use it right now...</p>
