message: <p>Hmm, that seems like revisionist history to me considering the Vatican banned his books (later lifted in 1835) and the Church itself recanted <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/world/after-350-years-vatican-says-galileo-was-right-it-moves.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/world/after-350-years-vatican-says-galileo-was-right-it-moves.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1992...</a></p><p>Also, if this narrative were true, why would a Pope say this?</p><p>&gt; Thanks to his intuition as a brilliant physicist and by relying on different arguments, Galileo, who practically invented the experimental method, understood why only the sun could function as the centre of the world, as it was then known, that is to say, as a planetary system. The error of the theologians of the time, when they maintained the centrality of the Earth, was to think that our understanding of the physical world's structure was, in some way, imposed by the literal sense of Sacred Scripture.... - Pope John Paul II</p>
