message: <p>I, respectfully, disagree with some of this. I agree that good teams are built on respect, empathy, and diversity. I also agree that too many "superstars" (or just one egotistical one) can be fatally toxic to a team and collaboration. You've done well to point that out in this post.</p><p>However, I don't think it's accurate to claim that it's a myth that great results come from solitary people. History contains a number of counter-examples to that claim. Personally, I think a team can take ideas and expand them and grow them in many ways, but often the spark of creation lies initially in just one mind.</p><p>Time alone to think and ponder and tinker is incredibly valuable. I think there is this developing myth that everyone must be doing all their work in the open, that everyone must be best friends with their work partners, that everyone must be in ceaseless communication. Supposedly half the world is introverted, which means that half the population feels energy drain by too much outward interaction. I think it's unreasonable to say that those introverted people haven't contributed and can't contribute in ways that work well for them, too.</p><p>There is a balance to be had between the team and the individual.</p><p>In conclusion, while perhaps too extreme:</p><p>"Our species is the only creative species, and it has only one creative instrument, the individual mind and spirit of man. Nothing was ever created by two men. There are no good collaborations, whether in music, in art, in poetry, in mathematics, in philosophy. Once the miracle of creation has taken place, the group can build and extend it, but the group never invents anything. The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man." ~ John Steinbeck in East of Eden.</p>
