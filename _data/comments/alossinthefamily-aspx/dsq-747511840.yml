message: <p>Phil,<br><br><br><br>I only recently started reading your blog, so I know you don't know me, but please accept my condolences from our family. It really does sound like he had a great life and I don't think there is anything to feel sad about it. He is in a better place now. Take care and please be there for your wife.<br><br><br><br>Carlos<br><br></p>
