message: <p>Ah man. It just gave me a really qeazy feeling in my stomach when I began to read this. I'm so very sorry o hear about your loss.  <br><br><br><br>A father has a very important role in a girls life and it sounds as though Akumi had a good relationship with him. Just hang in there. It'll be rough going for you as well. My prayers are with you both. <br><br><br><br>All the best. <br><br>Thomas</p>
