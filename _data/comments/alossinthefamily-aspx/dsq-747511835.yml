message: <p>Phil,<br><br>   I am terribly sorry for your loss, and for your wife's loss. Please extend my condolences to your wife.<br><br>How fortunate that you saw him so recently. From personal experience, I know that it blunts some of the pain of a loss like this. For me, it was my grandfather.<br><br>From the picture of him, your father-in-law looks like he was a happy person. He has the crinkles from smiling a lot. And, from your short tale of the trip to Japan, he knew how to enjoy life.<br><br>I am sure he will be deeply missed.</p>
