message: <p>Check out <a href="http://travelpost.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="travelpost.com">travelpost.com</a> to find cheap hotels.  And bring your lice repellent if you pay under $40 a night.  My fav is the Rio- if you PriceLine a 3.5 star hotel in Vegas there's a good chance you'll end up at the Rio.</p>
