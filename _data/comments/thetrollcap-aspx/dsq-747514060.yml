message: <p>The best way to deal with trolls is ignoring them. I've always wanted to implement a system where users who troll are marked as such by the admin. Future posts, due to security restrictions, allow the troll to read his or her own, but it marked as "READ:DENIED" for everyone else. Therefore, the troll will wonder why no one is responding and simply go away.<br><br><br><br>And I'm actually all for logging in to comment. I've seen some larger sites do it and actually improved their comment sections. Me? I've got 30 regular readers, so requiring sign up would kill the 2 comments a week I get (on par with posts, I guess).<br><br><br><br>The whole anonymity online thing is what breeds trolls and trollish behavior. That's why I use my name when posting - keeps me somewhat honest.</p>
