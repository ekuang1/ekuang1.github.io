message: <p>TortoiseGitMerge (included in TortoiseGit) can help ease this pain in the short term if you set it as your git mergetool.  If you choose "Include theirs before mine" (or more before theirs) in TortoiseGitMerge, it'll be the right solution almost all of the time.  (If I had a dime for every time I've clicked that...)</p>
