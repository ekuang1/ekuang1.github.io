message: "<p>First, I agree this decision the right direction - a break is absolutely what I want to happen here.</p><p>I pitched the .csproj sorting in Visual Studio on user voice a while ago: <a href=\"http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/4130464\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/4130464\">http://visualstudio.uservoi...</a></p><p>While I agree it doesn't eliminate the problem in your example: that neighbor addition; for our large projects, it's a very minority case.  The simple sorting would help tremendously: it would not change the format, yet almost always eliminate the same-point-in-the-list insertion behavior we always see. I'd argue that you're far more likely to have more developers, more branches, and commit conflicts as the project grows larger. Also not directly in the fix, but if the elements were in a known order (simple alphabetical as in the IDE I'd say) then merge tools have the option of making some more intelligent decisions.</p><p>I honestly don't know why this hasn't been implemented yet; I assume it's just lack of being noticed and a programmer assigned to do the work. I can't think of a technical reason it can't be implemented, but as always maybe there's a deep, dark rabbit hole in that code. If there is no rabbit hole, I wish the team would address something as fundamental as these constant conflicts. The addition of a new file picking the same spot in the .csproj almost every time actively generates more merge conflicts. I think fixing that while breaking nothing is a reasonable request.</p><p>An IDE experience isn't awesome if you immediately have to clean up after it. I'm really hoping this simple fix for a large number of our merge cases will land in a future update.</p>"
