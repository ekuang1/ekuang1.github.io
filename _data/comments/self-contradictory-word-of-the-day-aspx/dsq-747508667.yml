message: <p>There's an expression in Hebrew that goes "Haval Al Hazman" (KHäväl äl häzmän [1]). It originally meant "Waste of time", when describing anything. Modern slang also added another interpretation for it which means the exact opposite - "must be done", "must have", etc. (mostly spoken with excitement).<br><br>Another example in modern day English could be "bad", which means the exact opposite of the original term in slang.<br><br><br><br>And I never did know what moot really stood for. Thanks :)<br><br><br><br>[1] <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/help/ahd4/pronkey.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/help/ahd4/pronkey.html">http://dictionary.reference.com/help/ahd4/pronkey.html</a></p>
