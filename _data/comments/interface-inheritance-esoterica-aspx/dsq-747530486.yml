message: <p>Brian,<br>The difference is that classes define an is-a relationship, whereas interfaces don't (it's more like a can-do relationship). So An ISuperHero can do "Alias", and to obey the contract of ISuperHero, you must also implement IPerson (which can do "Name"), but that doesn't meant that ISuperHero is-a IPerson.<br>If you want the is-a relationship, you should use abstract classes instead.</p>
