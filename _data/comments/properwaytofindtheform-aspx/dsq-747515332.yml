message: <p>Well sort of.  With the HtmlForm and ASP.NET, you can generally be assured there is only one HtmlForm instance.  <br>But there might be multiple instances of a given control type. So a method like:<br></p><blockquote>public static string GetControlId(Type controlType, Control page)</blockquote><p><br>Would only return the first id.  Probably better to make it <br>public static string[] GetControlIds(Type controlType, Control page)</p>
