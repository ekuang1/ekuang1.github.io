message: <p>Do you know what your average daily page views are?  Do you think that has gone down as well?  I recall that you had some political posts before the election.  Now that people are not so interested in poltics as the moment, could that be where the decline is coming from? <br><br><br><br>I am around a 3 myself.  I think a lot helped when one of my posts was added to a couple apple sites and got over 5,000 new page views in one day.<br><br><br><br></p>
