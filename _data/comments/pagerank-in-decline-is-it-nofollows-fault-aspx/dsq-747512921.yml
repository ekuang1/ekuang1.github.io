message: <p>I've got a similar problem. Earlier this year I was up to 6 in some places, but mostly it's been hovering between 4 and 5.<br><br><br><br>But now about a month ago I noticed my root address of <a href="http://custom.softwarefor.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://custom.softwarefor.net/">http://custom.softwarefor.net/</a> is 0, but if I go to <a href="http://custom.softwarefor.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://custom.softwarefor.net/">http://custom.softwarefor.net/</a>default.aspx then it's 3. And oddly enough my contact page is 4, but some of my more highly linked articles are lower. I think someone or something is asleep at the switch at Google.<br><br><br><br>I linked to you, from my link section (pr 3). Hope that helps.</p>
