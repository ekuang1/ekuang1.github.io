message: <p>I've noticed some strangeness on my site as well:<br><br><br><br>-Homepage (<a href="http://jaysonknight.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="jaysonknight.com">jaysonknight.com</a>) is a 4, yet the traffic to that page is abysmal to say the least.<br><br>-Blog is a n/a (<a href="http://jaysonknight.com/blog)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="jaysonknight.com/blog)">jaysonknight.com/blog)</a>, and it's got some pretty decent traffic coming in.<br><br>-Gallery is a 3, and has more traffic than my homepage but not as much as the blog page.<br><br><br><br>Overall since moving to CS (which also makes use of nofollow) my site traffic has dropped drastically and I haven't been able to crawl back up to a 5.  In all, there are just too many variables on my end to try and figure out wtf is going on, though I also agree that something strange is going on over at Google.<br><br><br><br>When I was on .Text I was receiving roughly 15x as much traffic, most of it Google generated, whereas my new site simply doesn't seem to be Google friendly whatsoever.  But I digress.</p>
