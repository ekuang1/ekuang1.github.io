message: <p>I bet if you just ignore the problem it won't be a big deal.  Viruses that target Visual Studio users?  Isn't it easier to just target Windows users?  You have a much larger target with well-known attack vectors.  And it's too easy to have malicious extensions or nuget packages removed from their respective galleries.</p><p>I appreciate the nod toward safety.  I appreciate that you are concerned about the NuGet community.  I'm just not seeing the benefit.  Wouldn't a simple voting system accomplish much the same purpose?  Or you know, put it on the developer to safeguard their machines.  We spend at least $50/yr per developer on security-related software (Antivirus, anti-malware, sandboxes, etc).  How about letting those guys do their job of keeping us safe and you you guys focus on making the best darn nuget you can.</p><p>In conclusion, I guess the point I'm trying to express is that I don't see it as NuGet's responsibility to keep me safe.  It's my responsibility.  I don't ask that <a href="http://Terminal.app" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Terminal.app">Terminal.app</a> keep me from shooting myself in the foot.  Or my chat apps.  Or my development environments.  In fact, I dislike it when I'm told I can't do something that someone else considers high-risk (like emailing myself an exe in a zip file).</p>
