message: <p>Hi, i made some inflammatory comment on nuget a while back, probably discrediting my self,  none the less my issue with nuget is one of trust too but an aspect you did not cover.<br>Let's say im interested in a oss proj, these days more and more people only release compiled code via nuget. So i get the package and next thing i know it has altered my web.config,  added a few classes and god knows what else. Elmah does this. Totally benign. Actually a convenience.  However, if i want to repeat this installation on an other branch ir proj, i have no idea what was done, or say on qa or prod where i leave the web.config be. <br>Worse yet what if you try to remove the installation manually and miss stuff, your proj is now got all manner of cruft in it. <br>I know the short answer is do everything through nuget and everything will be wonderful, and/or only add nuget packs to some test proj till you know what they do.  <br>I would like to know exactly what a nuget pack plans to do and an alternate manual route before i install. <br>None the less everyone seems to be on board, perhaps i should just drink up. <br></p>
