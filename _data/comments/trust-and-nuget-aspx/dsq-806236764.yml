message: <p>Thanks for chiming in! I wouldn't say I'm entrenched against them, I just think the reality is they hold more promise than they deliver.</p><p>For example, you mention that they're relatively cheap at $50-$100. But the cost is not just monetary. It's in the hassle to get one.</p><p>And as small as that cost+hassle is to you, it's clearly a barrier. Otherwise everybody would be signing their projects!Â So it's not that I don't think it's a great idea for everyone to do this. I do! I just don't think they will no matter how much you try to convince them. I think the VS Extension Gallery is evidence of this. They support signing and surface it in the UI, but apart from the ones shipped by MS, very few are signed.</p><p>Another way to look at it is I'm not being prescriptive against signing, I'm being descriptive of developers existing attitudes towards it.</p><p>A lot of the libraries in NuGet are small little libraries by one person working alone on a pet OSS project. Chances are they threw it up quickly and don't care to get the cert.</p><p>If we support signing, I would definitely want to surface that information in the UI. That's a no-brainer and a good idea.</p><p>I think the main point is, even if we did everything you suggested, I guarantee so few projects would do it that we'd have to still provide another mechanism to help people establish trust that's essentially "free" to developers.</p><p>Ultimately, I want to do it all! But I think we'll get more bang for the buck by the simple OAuth approaches to establishing identity first.</p><p>Again, thanks for the comment. It does make me think harder about the value of certs.</p>
