message: <p>I prefer the days when the standard approach was to pull down raw source code, review it myself, and then compile it myself. Then, I knew it was safe, and I knew what the dependencies were, and I could manage it myself. I may be old-school, but I am highly concerned about security these days and about tracking dependencies and version compatibility.</p>
