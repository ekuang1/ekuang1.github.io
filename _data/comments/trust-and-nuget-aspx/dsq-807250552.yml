message: <p>True but I can verify that the package hasn't changed since creation by a particular individual or organization. Additionally, I know that an update to a package actually came from the same individual that created the original. It's not a panacea but it creates some trust. In some cases, verifying that my update came from a vendor like Microsoft instead of someone saying they're Microsoft is pretty important.</p><p>Again, I think the biggest problem is that the tools are just awful for signing and verifying signatures.</p>
