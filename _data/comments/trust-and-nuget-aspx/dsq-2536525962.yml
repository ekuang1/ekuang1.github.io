message: <p>I had been using random authors packages due to popular authors not keeping their packages up-to-date, and then realized the huge security risk that comes with that.</p><p>I am in the process of trying out the gx package manager (<a href="https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx)">https://github.com/whyrusle...</a> as an alternative to nuget. Its not language specific, it supports any language.</p><p>It uses IPFS under the hood to reference the package as a hash of its content, this way the contents can be verified once either by a deterministic compilation by many or by a trusted author and if the hashes match we are good to go.  You cant change the content without the hash changing.</p><p>The other benefit is no central server like <a href="http://nuget.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="nuget.org">nuget.org</a> to get hacked, basically each author sets up their own mini repo, if my project uses bootstrap and pgsql I would add both of those authors as mini repos and then receive future updates as they happen from the authors.</p><p>For package updates I would check github changelog to make sure a new update has related commits, otherwise the mini repo owner could have been hacked and I shouldn't download the latest version until confirmation.</p><p>It seems like this might be the way to go.</p>
