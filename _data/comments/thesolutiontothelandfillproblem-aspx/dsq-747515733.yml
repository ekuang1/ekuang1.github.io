Thatâ€™s less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the land in the U.S. (cite: <a href=\"http://www.cei.org/gencon/005,04527.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.cei.org/gencon/005,04527.cfm\">Competitive Enterprise Intstitute</a>) <br>However, I totally agree with you about collectibles. In fact, it seems the tea industry is leading the way, I noticed <a href=\"http://pomwonderful.com/pomTeaBlack.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://pomwonderful.com/pomTeaBlack.html\">POM Wonderful teas</a> are also sold in an attractive \"keepsake glass\".</p>"
