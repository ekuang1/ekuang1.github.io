message: <p>Recycle everything you can, on a regular bases to avoid trash build-up and attracting critters.  I avoid perchasing unrecyclable products but I have gotten better reusing, reducing and finally recycling everything since I do not even have space for a compost:(  So I use cloth napkins instead of paper.  And get all my office and household paper products made 100% recycled when I can.</p>
