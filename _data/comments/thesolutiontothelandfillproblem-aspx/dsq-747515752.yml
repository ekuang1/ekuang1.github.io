message: <p>I really do, truely believe that recycling collectables is a value irreplaceable in today's world.  So much is thrown away these days. It is a crime.  I fully agree with the prospect of collecting tins and the such.  I have been doing that for 60 years.  Thank you for letting the world (via internet) know of such wonderful ideas! :)</p>
