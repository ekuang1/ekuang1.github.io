message: <p>I meant to comment about this before and never got around to it. You are one of the most diligent TDD devs that I know in the .NET world. A place where a lot of people don't even know where to start with TDD. Which TDD framework should I use.... how do I deal with data or databases. Are there different ways to address some core problems. Should I write a test first? etc etc etc. <br>Can I recommend that time permitting you write down your own experience in a how-to series. I think it would be tremendously useful to a lot of people and really draws on one of your strengths.</p>
