message: <p>@Aaron Ah! I see what you're saying. So it seems to me that you're suggesting we put another service in between Controller and IViewFactory. Is that right?<br>Yes, I could have mocked IViewFactory, but after the IView is returned from the factory, the RenderView method also creates a ViewContext which is passed to the view when rendering which requires other dependencies I need to mock.<br>It ends up being seriously less code than just overriding RenderView. Perhaps that's a code smell. Perhaps it's saying I should just override RenderView and go home. ;)<br>Once the bits are out, I'd love to hear about your TDD experience and see how we can improve it.</p>
