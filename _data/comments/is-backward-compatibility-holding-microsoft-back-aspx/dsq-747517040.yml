message: <p>The primary complaint I'm hearing about using a VM is from mobile device developers and people doing low-level, driver development. Virtual PC/VMWare do not do a very good job virtualizing USB and other device ports apparently and it means they have to try and migrate all of their projects to VS 2005. <br>My only option for the single VS 2003 web site I have to support is a re-write. It was badly architected and porting it to ASP.NET 2.0 will require about as much time as a full re-write.</p>
