message: <p>Let's not forget, less than a year ago VS 2003 was the premier development environment from Microsoft. Not supporting it on their new OS conflicts with their own lifecycle support policy, and in my opinion isn't a reasonable position to take. <br>It doesn't help that they so far haven't told us *what* won't work - only nebulous comments about "advanced" scenarios. Give us the details, it'll probably make people feel better. <br>But at the same time, I think they need to step and commit to a service pack in the future to address the major issues. We're not talking about a 10 year piece of software here. MS is proud to trot out Visicalc from time to time to show that it still runs. Who cares? We need the tools that we use on a daily basis to work.<br>Speaking of Vsicalc, I wonder how much code exists in Windows to make that sucker still run. Maybe they could start their source cleanup by trimming THAT code out ;).<br></p>
