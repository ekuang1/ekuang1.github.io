message: <p>I agree with you, but from my understanding, only limited scenarios don't work with VS.NET 2003.  From a cost/benefit perspective, it might make sense to bite the bullet, install VPC for those few scenarios and feel free to upgrade to Vista.  Nobody's forcing you *not* to upgrade either. ;)<br>I guess my point is I think VPC is a decent enough compromise.  But not everyone agrees and I understand that.  <br>What remains to be seen is if this really bites Microsoft in the foot.  Maybe the next time we see Ballmer speak, he'll have to reduce the number of times he says "Developers!".</p>
