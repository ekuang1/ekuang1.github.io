message: "<p>The issue that I still haven't heard addressed by anyone is licensing.<br>Is Microsoft going to let me use my OEM license key from an ancient machine so that I can run Windows XP in a virtual machine on Vista to test and debug in VS 2003?<br>I think not.<br>I recently wrote microsoft with detailed questions about virtual machine licensing issues and here is the response I got back:<br>\"If you need information about using a Microsoft product, please refer to the product's End User License Agreement (EULA), which describes the permissible uses of that software. To find and review the EULA for your product, visit the following Web site: <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/legal/useterms/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.microsoft.com/legal/useterms/\">http://www.microsoft.com/le...</a>.\"<br>The complete copout response from a cut and paste set of text.  Let's face it, the reason they couldn't answer the question is because they still haven't figured it out themselves.<br>They are telling use to use a virtual machine to solve a problem they should have done natively, but have not yet presented us with any kind of licensing scheme<br>Want to develop in VS 2003 on Vista? No problem - just give us another $189 for an additional license of XP Pro to run in a virtual machine.  That's weak.  It just screams \"STEAL ME!\"</p>"
