message: <p>I can only speak for myself, but I think a lot of developers feel the same way I do. We move to a different platform, at least in our day-to-day work, when our deployment target moves to a different platform. I didn't move to XP Pro until last year, after I was satisfied that all of the projects I'm responsible for would compile and work the same under XP as they did under Win2K. It's in Microsofts best interests to make sure we ALL upgrade, both from a mindshare and a security POV. So for the last...FIVE...years, they've been beating the security drum and trumpeting that as THE reason to upgrade (developers were given other reasons, Avalon, WinFS, etc... which changed along the way).<br>So what happens when my users move to Vista, as part of a large enterprise upgrade "encouraged" by Microsoft through our vendors and support plans, and I can't upgrade because I have to support .Net 1.1 projects? It sounds like they've changed a lot wrt memory manangement, how can I be sure that my old apps will perform well under Vista? What kind of dependency bugs will creep in by compiling on one platform and deploying to another? Fear! Uncertainty! Doubt!<br>Trust me, Microsoft is going to start "encouraging" people to move to Vista harder and harder in the coming year. They can't be satisfied with waiting for people to upgrade their computers. Vista has to be a success right out of the gate.</p>
