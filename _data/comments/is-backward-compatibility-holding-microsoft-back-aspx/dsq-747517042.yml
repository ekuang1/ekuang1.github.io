It's very true that Microsoft needs some strategies facilitate the immense amount of refactoring they'll need to do, and I'm hoping that the VPC is not their lead strategy.<br>On the \"design debt caused the Vista slip\" thing, I posted a comment along those lines on Jeff's infamous Joel Spoelsky Jumped The Shark post. Mike Dimmick had some interesting counterpoints, though:<br>\"@Jon Galloway: I repeatedly hear the argument that Vista was delayed because of backwards compatibility constraints. Far from it. The problem was in the other direction: that various teams in user mode were trying to write their new components (e.g. Explorer, Sidebar) on top of Avalon, which was in itself on top of .NET 2.0. These components were never stable enough to know whether a bug was in your code or in your dependencies. Eventually a halt was called to this morass of shifting sands. This isn't a reflection on the quality of .NET at all - just that trying to develop on top of a developing runtime is practically impossible. Microsoft may use new C++ compilers with new releases of Windows, but they've got literally twenty years of working code in there and can revert to an older version if there's a problem.<br>In the two years since then, they've tried to get what features they can implemented on top of the old Win32 API so they have something to ship.
