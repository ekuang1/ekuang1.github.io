message: "<p>After reading Dave's actual post, I find it hard to understand the amount of commentary posted here.  He hasn't even seen the movie.  For the most part the post looks like a lot of hastily-strewn-together, jingoist rhetoric.<br><br><br><br>“I’m an American before I’m a member of any political party…”<br><br><br><br>We could pick this apart, but I suppose we can give him the benefit of the doubt and translate this as, “I’m a patriotic American and don’t like our government criticized.”<br><br><br><br>“…I have more invested in the intelligence of our decision-making process than in any one decision.  I'd rather re-elect Bush than elect a president based on Moore's politics.”<br><br><br><br>What this “one decision” that he speaks of might be, we can only guess.  However, I find it rather difficult to understand how one could be so comforted by the ability of our intelligence capabilities that we need not question our government.  Granted, Moore is no substitute for a functioning Central Intelligence Agency, but a flawed CIA is no substitute for an informed, inquisitive electorate.  And, finally…<br><br><br><br>“[Moore] confronts members of Congress and asks if they would send their children to fight in Iraq. What a ridiculous question. No parent will say yes to that question.”<br><br><br><br>This is simply untrue.  Plenty of people would be proud to serve and have their children serve in the military.  Many would be proud to give their lives for their country.  Perhaps after Dave sees the film he’ll revise his comments. <br><br><br><br>(I’m not even going to go into Dave’s claims of Moore being “the worst of American politics, an opportunist,” and “an anti-intellectual.”  But, one quick question:  If Michael Moore and George W. Bush collide, will they annihilate in a flash of light and energy?)</p>"
