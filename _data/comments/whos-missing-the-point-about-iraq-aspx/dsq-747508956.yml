message: "<p>It's disgusting when people disparage the military with lies about the socio-economic and ethnic make up of the armed services. It's the same old anti Vietnam war rhetoric, and it's as wrong now as it is now. <br><br><br><br>--88.4% of the men who actually served in Vietnam were Caucasian; 10.6% (275,000) were black; 1% belonged to other races.<br><br>--76% of the men sent to Vietnam were from lower middle/working class backgrounds.<br><br>--Thee-fourths had family incomes above the poverty level; 50% were from middle income backgrounds.<br><br>--Some 23% of Vietnam vets had fathers with professional, managerial or technical occupations.<br><br><br><br>--I wasn't able to quickly find anything on current socio-economic statistics, but 64.7% of current service members are white, 18.8% black, and 9% Hispanic.<br><br><br><br>Reasons for going to war should always be debated, but it's horrible to lie (or parrot a party line) about the military just to serve some political end.<br><br><br><br>Sources: <a href=\"http://www.hqda.army.mil/library/statistics.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.hqda.army.mil/library/statistics.htm\">http://www.hqda.army.mil/library/statistics.htm</a><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>"
