message: <p>Well said Niels!  I agree that we can't just pull out now.  I'm just hoping we as a people and our government learns from this.  However, there is nothing learned if we don't recognize the mistakes.  It infuriates me how Bush will sit there and not just own up to having made any mistakes at all.  Certainly Clinton made mistakes.  Moore's made mistakes.  I made mistakes.  But no not Bush and his precious staff.</p>
