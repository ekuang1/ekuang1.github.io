message: <p>Come on!  Moore's movie is not a documentary!  It's a complete ANTI-BUSH film.  He has every right to say what he wants!  <br><br><br><br>Watch this movie and go in with an honest mind.  You will see some truths and some lies.  You have a mind, don't make it up because your a Democratic and that you are supposed to hate Bush, or a Republican who takes everything Bush says as the gospel.<br><br><br><br>I used to be a Republican but I also can't call my self a Democratic either because both parties have been hijacked by either the Reglious right or the extremely hateful left.  I am embrassed for both parties these days.<br><br><br><br>I agreed on the war on Iraqi to get rid of the WMD but I did not sign on to bring democracy to the world.  People of a nation have to do this for themselves for it to mean anything.  <br><br><br><br>Knowing what we know now I would not have supported the war.  (Which I believe most people would agree with now)  But we have to clean up the mess we made.  We can't fuck up the place, then pull out.  If we did that now we would be doing so much worse than just invading them.  We need to accept the fact that we screwed up and try to fix the problem.<br><br><br><br>Goverment on the most part freaks me out matter what party is in power.  There is a goup of people that control the rest of us.  It's not one party or the other.  It's both.  Power corrupts people.  It's been like that from the beginning of time and it will be like this to the end of time.<br><br><br><br>That's all I have to say about that!<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
