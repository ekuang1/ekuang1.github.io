Intravenous drug formulations, in 2005 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval : tigecycline for the treatment of patients aged 18 and older infections caused by susceptible strains , indications include : complicated intra-abdominal infections ( such as complicated appendicitis ,<a href="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Tigecycline-mesylate.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Tigecycline-mesylate.html">Tigecycline mesylate</a>， burns infections, intra-abdominal abscesses, deep soft tissue infections and infected ulcers ) and complicated skin and soft tissue infections. The drug can overcome the limitations of many two main resistance mechanisms of antimicrobial drug use : efflux pumps and ribosomal protection. 1 shows a lot of old literature : the drug can be used to treat multi-drug resistant , such as MRSA, VRE, producing extended-spectrum 13 -lactamase bacterial infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae .<a href="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Ofloxacin.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Ofloxacin.html">Ofloxacin</a><br>To understand the in vitro antibacterial activity of the drug , the trial of the 2009 and 2010 clinical isolates from the Ministry of Health, Beijing Hospital, 400 clinical MIC common bacteria were measured to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of the drug .</p><p>Medchemexpress Can provide the above product,its website:<a href="http://www.medchemexpress.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.medchemexpress.com">www.medchemexpress.com</a></p>'
