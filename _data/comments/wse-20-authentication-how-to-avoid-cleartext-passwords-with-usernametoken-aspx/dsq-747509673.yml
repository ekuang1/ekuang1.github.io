message: <p>Hi, I am up against this same problem with the password hashed in a database. No offence because I cannot offer a better solution than your's but here is the problems I see with it.<br><br><br><br>The beauty of WSE is the ability to say to fellow developer here is the service authenticate by WSE using your credentials. You should not have to explain how to Hash the password before sending and using web services to grab the salt etc.<br><br><br><br>But most importantly the password is hashed in the database to make it useless to a potential hacker who actually happens to find it. With the above solution if a hacker is able to grab the password from your database he is able to authenticate to your service directly, without the hashing and salt requesting above (it is already hashed for him) <br><br><br><br>So in effect it is easier for a hacker with a hash of the password stolen from your DB in his possesion to authenticate to your service than it is a legitimate developer with the original password.<br><br><br><br>From what I can see the only soltions appear to be to have the password unhashed in the DB and protect it with SQL encryption and SQL security, or only accept plain text passwords from WSE.</p>
