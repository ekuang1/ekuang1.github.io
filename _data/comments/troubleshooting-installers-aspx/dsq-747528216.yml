message: <p>I'm stuck at the ngen part of the process.  I've been contacted by Jacques and I have sent him my ngen logs.<br>It seems that ngen is stuck and choking on something.  It always throws the 'Catastrophic Failure' message.  Not really something one wants to hear from an important computer LOL.<br>I did manage to install <a href="http://ASP.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="ASP.net">ASP.net</a> MVC RC2 via the Orca hack.  I will keep looking out for a solution to this problem.  I'm starting to feel like a system rebuild is on the horizon.  not great.</p>
