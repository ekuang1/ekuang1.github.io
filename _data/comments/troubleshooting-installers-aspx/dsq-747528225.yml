message: <p>I'm copying a comment here that I posted on Rob's blog:<br>Hi Rob, perhaps I should have added more disclaimers to my post. :) <br>One thing I want to make clear is that we did *NOT* wait until the last second to focus on the installer.<br>We've had installer testing all along the whole process. With every release, we've tested the installer.<br>However, we've also had to change the installer with nearly every release as we find certain assumptions change.<br>For example, with the very first release, we were part of the System.Web.Extensions MSI. Then we decided to split MVC into its own installer, which caused ownership of the installer to change hands to a different developer.<br>More recently, we decided to add in the silent install with server-only options. Finally, we very recently learned that shipping System.Web.Routing and System.Web.Abstractions with MVC would be a problem as they are now part of .NET 3.5 SP1. So we needed to remove those assemblies and add a check to the installer that ensures that SP1 check was on the machine.<br>I wish I had the foresight to see all these changes ahead of time, but I did not anticipate them. Partly because I'm still learning my way around existing release processes at Microsoft, and partly because we're cutting new ground with how we release software with ASP.NET MVC.<br>Again, my point here is we *have* been testing all along AND working with the Visual Studio team/CLR team regarding these issues. I wish we had them all resolved already, but we don't.<br>The troubleshooting guide was just a way to give people more insight into what's going on, at their own risk. I think your feedback is right-on regarding how I ordered MSIZap. It really is the nuclear option and I should maybe put radioactive signs around that paragraph. ;)</p>
