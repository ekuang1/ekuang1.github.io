message: <p>As it may just yesterday I posted the article on <a href="http://devcomponents.com/blog/?p=54" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://devcomponents.com/blog/?p=54">How to prepare for hard-disk catastrophic failures</a>. The crashes happen more often than you think and after seeing number of emails from people writing to request backup of their serial numbers and software from us, I decided to write down my processes and procedures for backup.<br>It is a lengthy piece but I try to outline what worked for me and hope that other people find it useful. <br>BTW, I use Mozy and works great for me. However, it is online backup system and I recommend using any online backup system for critical data that are not too large. I do not think that backing up 1-2 Gigs is really practical over Internet.<br>Hope this helps...</p>
