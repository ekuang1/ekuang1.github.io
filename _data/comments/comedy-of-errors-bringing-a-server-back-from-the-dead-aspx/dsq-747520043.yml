message: <p>I did one of those os reloads just the other day on a costumers laptop that he had four boot choices of xp pro that all were dead. so I popped in my trusty os reload disk I had ordered from Microsoft and rebooted when i got to the hdd setup screen. I saw about ten partitions on his drive so I started deleting them. I FORGOT to pull my 2gig thumb drive out of the laptop, well I lost about $2500 worth of system tools on it! you ask about the backups, well the owner dropped the 250gig ext. drive off our 3 foot high work bench while it was running. it made a loud screech and only clicked ofter that. double ouch!!! Don't ask what that cost him.</p>
