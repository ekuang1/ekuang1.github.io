message: <p>I fell your pain. I remember when i spent 3 hours backing all my stuff to another hard drive in my computer, started the xp install, formatted the partition, went and got a drink, sat down, sighed...... OMG. what hard drive did i pick??????<br>in the end i just went back to my trusty <a href="http://www.ontrack.com/easyrecoveryprofessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.ontrack.com/easyrecoveryprofessional/">ontrack backup</a>. got about 90% of the data :S.<br>The lesson i learned? don't just format the drive you think you should format based on the drive letter that it has in the setup process...</p>
