message: <p>This reminds me of a time when I had to fix my mums printer. I plugged into my machine and it didn't work. I figured it might be the cable and so I tried another one. When that didn't work I tried a third.<br>Eventually I replaced the printer only to find out that <strong>all of the printer cables I'd tried were bad</strong>.<br>It had not occurred to me that that might happen.</p>
