message: <p>Krenn has a good point. I had a bit of a hard time understanding which devices I could have connected at the same time and on which channels. My mobo has connectors for 4 PATA drives and 4 SATA drives but I cannot have all of those at the same time. <br>But, of course, it can still be fried anyway.</p>
