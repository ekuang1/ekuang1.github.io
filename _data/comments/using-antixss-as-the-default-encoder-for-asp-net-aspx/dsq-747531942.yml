message: <p>Heh. So as the lead developer on AntiXSS/WPL I can say that the next public release will have its own class for this. Actually, it'll have its own assembly for this, as it's a NET 4.0 only function.<br>The main difference between the two sets of encoders is the approach. The .NET encoder uses a small blacklist for its encoding, AntiXSS uses a large whitelist. While this is safer it does have a performance cost which some folks may find hard to swallow. We publish performance states for the WPL, but I don't think we've ever published stats for the raw encoders - I'll take a look at doing that.<br>Note that you don't need to use the WPL to use AntiXSS - you can manually encode to your heart's content and the next release will separate out the encoding classes into their own assembly again.</p>
