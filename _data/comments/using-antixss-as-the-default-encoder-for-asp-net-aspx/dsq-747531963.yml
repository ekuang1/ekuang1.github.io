message: <p>Hello Phil,<br>I tried using the code given for creating AntiXss encoder. It works fine for my most of the pages. But, on some of my pages I am using Google recaptcha, after using AntiXss encoder, the captcha is not working. Can u tell teh reason for that?<br>Is there any way to know if a string is already encoded, so as to avoid double encoding?<br>Thanks<br>Ashwani<br></p>
