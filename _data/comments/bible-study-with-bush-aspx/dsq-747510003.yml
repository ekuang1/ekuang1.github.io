message: "<p>The seperation of church and state is a tough one. Remember, I grew up in Germany so I have a different perspective on religion. Somehow I cant help but to think it has something to do with fear. I'm not nearly the theologian that you need to answer that question but I have learned one thing: people either act out of a basis of love or a basis of fear. So if you have some very conservative folks advocating the erection of these plaques its probably because they are afraid. America is a strange country sometimes. But there is no place like it in the world and that makes it very special (faults and all) .</p>"
