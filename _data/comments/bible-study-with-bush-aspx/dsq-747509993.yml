message: "<p>You're right about not wanting to get into a spirituality discussion.  Those discussions generally run in circles like this (paraphrased):<br><br><br><br>\"Believe in the Bible\"<br><br>\"No\"<br><br>\"Yes\"<br><br>\"No\"<br><br>\"Yes\"<br><br>\"No\"...<br><br><br><br>Nobody is going to convince anyone else to switch sides.  Belief (or lack thereof) comes from within.  It didn't take someone to convince me to give up my belief, it came from an epiphany and serious study.<br><br><br><br>Though once in a while I like to poke a few ribs.  I've posted something like this before: <br><br><br><br><a href=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2004/02/27/214.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2004/02/27/214.aspx\">https://haacked.com/archive/2004/02/27/214.aspx</a><br><br><a href=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2004/03/22/267.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2004/03/22/267.aspx\">https://haacked.com/archive/2004/03/22/267.aspx</a><br><br><br><br>However, I was surprised that you pounced on this one before my little brother did.  He's got a pretty good grasp of the Bible.  He's in England saving the British right now.  Believe me, I have a pretty good understanding of theology and the Bible, though I no longer subscribe to it in any way.  That's a loooong story.<br><br><br><br>And you're right. I don't think faith based initiatives and gay amendments have any place in our government.  The obvious problem is which faith?  As the list points out, why not choose to base our laws on the Torah?<br><br><br><br>At the same time, I don't have a problem with public figures expressing their faith.  It's a part of who they are.  But imposing it on others, that's where the line needs to drawn.<br><br><br><br>In any case, most of my close friends are true believers and have a similar philosophy to yours.  I appreciate the open mindedness and tolerance.  Too bad that you're the minority (in my view) when it comes to Republicans.  ;)<br><br><br><br>And thanks for the kind words about the blog.  I hope to keep it as a good read.</p>"
