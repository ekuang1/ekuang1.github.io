message: '<p>Most of the laws in the Old Testament were done away with when Jesus took us out from under the Law and brought us under Grace.  However, certain laws were in place for more than just guiding daily living.  Some laws existed because breaking them was sin.  The ten commandments are among those.  Jesus spoke about the specifics of how different laws apply in this day.  Homosexuality, though Jesus does not address it, is addressed by Paul in a letter to the Romans.  The ban of homosexuality is an excellent example of a law that was more than law.  It is an abomination to God.  It is contrary to His very being.  God created Man male and female.  He set it up thus: a man should leave his parents, and a woman hers, to be joined together as one.  God did not intend for two men, or two women, to try to bond in such a way.  We live under Grace, not the Law, but sin is still sin.</p>'
