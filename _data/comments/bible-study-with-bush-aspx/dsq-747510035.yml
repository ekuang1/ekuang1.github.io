message: <p>Wow, I think reading the comments section was even funnier than reading the original post.<br>That was so not even about Bush at all.  I'm not even sure why it mentioned his name.  In fact, I would be willing to bet this was originally written as a fake letter to a priest or pastor or something, and some overzealous liberal decided to change it to Bush's name.<br>You people who respond to this with "HAHA AWESOME POST OMG BUSH SUX THIS IS SOOOOO FUNNEH!!" are pretty much exactly what is wrong with America right now.  People are so focused on being anti-Bush (because it's apparently "cool" and "hip" to hate Bush nowadays) that they don't even care about the issues, they just want to get rid of him.  Their answer to every political issue is "Bush sucks!  Impeach him!"  Bush didn't act alone, there were plenty of people in the government - Democrats, Independents, AND Republicans - who initiated, enabled, and supported a lot of the things that have screwed up America over the years.  What we need is widespread change, a complete overhaul.. We need to get rid of the stupid party system so we can start electing candidates who represent the people, rather than representing one of two radical, self-interested parties that the vast majority of Americans don't agree with.<br>Wow I can't believe I just launched into a huge political argument in the comments section of a blog.. I feel like a loser..<br>Anyway, funny post.  I enjoyed it :)</p>
