message: '<p>I find this hilarious and true on so many levels! Remember all you bible-beating monkeys: God exists in the here and now. Not just in the Bible days of Old. If God has shown us one obvious truth it is that life is always changing. Cell are constantly changing, seasons change, we breathe. One second changes to the next. With life always changin then, how do you ever try to impose laws that are over 2000 years old???!!</p>'
