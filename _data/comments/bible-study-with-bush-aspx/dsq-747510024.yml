message: <p>You are all right. According to the Bible, whether you are believing in only the Old Testament or believing that the New Testament superceded and voided that which was said in the Old Testament, homosexuality is not allowed. Of course, if you are going by the Old Testament it is the homosexual act which is not allowed, and I am guessing that by the New Testament it is thought as well, but that is besides the point.<br><br><br><br>The point of the matter is simply that we do not live in Vatican City, we do not live in Davidic Israel, we do not live an a theological society. The point of the government is not to decide what and what not is G-d's law. That is the job of the holy men of the religious practice that you happen to follow. The United States is not a religious entity and while the country is mostly populated by Christians, the country is not ruled by Christianity. If it were, and Chrisitians began to force their laws upon the rest of the society, we are in violating of the First Amendment, freedom of religion.<br><br><br><br>I hope you all realize the implications of this. You see all the women being oppressed in Iran, Saudi Arabia and other Muslim run countries? It has nothing to do with the fact that the countries are not democratic. It has to do with the fact that they are run by laws that are based off of the Koran. And you know what, don't start up by saying that the Koran is wrong (I know it is spelled with a Qu, but I don't know its exact spelling. I apologize to any muslim readers if I am offending, I am trying to make a point. Please take no offense) really has nothing to do with that fact. It is just as valid a belief as any other religion. So what is to make the difference then between our country and the countries that Bush is so fervently trying to oppose?<br><br><br><br>Anywho. The point of the article, I imagine, is to show Bush's hypocracy in the religious sense. I found it quite amusing. But if you are going to argue against an article, CLEARLY written only as a humor piece, then consider the above. Maybe he is not being hypocratic in that place, but in another. <br><br><br><br>But we'd better get used to it. 3.75 more years. Here's to hoping we don't start adopting all the laws of the Puritans.<br><br><br><br>-Jer</p>
