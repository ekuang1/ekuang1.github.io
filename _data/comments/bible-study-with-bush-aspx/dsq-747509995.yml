message: <p>Phil - I know its hard to believe but yes you are correct. The ten commandments do not apply anymore. It may sound crazy to anyone other than theologians - and even there you may get into some debates about it. But really, they have been superceded by Jesus' teachings, which are really much much harder to follow. Can you imagine "loving thy enemeny as thyself" - and he wasn't kidding. He meant it. So tell me whats easier - not killing your enemy or loving him as you love yourself. <br><br><br><br>I really got a big kick out of the post and I am a Christian. Still it was hilarious to me. I think I had heard a few of these arguments in an installment of West Wing - when Aaron Sorkin was still writing the show. What a talent that guy had</p>
