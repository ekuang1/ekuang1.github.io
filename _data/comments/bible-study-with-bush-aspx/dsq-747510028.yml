message: <p>I usually don't get involved in these type of things, they always seem to turn into a contest of conversion.  It is not my intention to change anyone's mind about anything, but as a follower of Christ I do feel a need to point something out.<br><br><br><br>     Contrary to what has been said before, the law, including the 10 commandments, are still in effect.  Saying that Jesus came to fulfill the law as an excuse to abolish it is untrue.  Jesus stated several times that he did not come to take away the law.  He stated that not a jot or tittle would be removed from the law, (jot being the smallest letter and tittle being the smallest punctuation in the Hebrew alphabet.)<br><br><br><br>     In comparing the Old and New Testament, and the validity of the laws of Moses it's important to define sin.  Sin literally means "to miss the mark", in this case the mark is God's perfection.  Breaking the laws was to sin.  Jesus took it a step further to include sins of the heart.  (i.e. looking on a woman with lust being adultery of the heart).<br><br><br><br>     Without getting into a long theological debate, the law is good for one thing and one thing only, convicting man of his sin.  No one, outside of Christ, can keep all the laws of God.  No one can reach God's perfection.  After all if you break down the original sin, Adam put us in this boat by eating a piece of fruit.  It wasn't the act of eating the fruit, it was the choice of Adam to defy God's will, to sin, (to miss the mark).<br><br><br><br>     So the question is, does Christ's sacrifice free us from the law?  The answer is no it does not.  It frees us from the penalty that comes from breaking it.  To clarify, it frees those who accept him as their savior.  Those who do not remain under the condemnation of the law.<br><br><br><br>     The saved and the lost have one thing in common, we continue to sin.  If a Christian tells you they don't, they have just lied and sinned again.  The perfect, righteous, glory of God is something no person can attain.  Christ is our intercessor, his perfection makes the difference.<br><br><br><br>     The obvious question then is, if a Christian is saved can they do anything they want?  Live anyway they want?  Break any law they want?  Paul anticipated this question in his letter to the Romans.  Take 15 minutes out of your day and read Romans 6,7 and 8.<br><br><br><br>     Since homosexuality seems to have become a catalyst for this string of comments let me say this.  I do believe it is an abomination.  Just like adultery, murder, lies, hate, bigotry, immorality, pride, lust, etc. etc.  I have fit into more than one of these groups in my lifetime, how about you.<br><br><br><br>     I will admit that Christians can often times come across as sanctimonious.  It's a fault that many Christians have but we all get labeled with it.  If you turn that mirror around, I've found that many who have no place for God come across as arrogant and uniformed.  I would be gravely mistaken to label everyone that way.<br><br><br><br>     Since the stakes are as high as they are I do sincerely pray for those who ignore God's voice and remain under the condemnation of the law.  There are really only two fundamental thoughts here, God or no God.  If the latter is true then everyone has just wasted about 5 minutes listening to one of those crazy Christians rattle on.  If the former is true however......     <br><br></p>
