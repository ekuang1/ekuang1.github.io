message: <p>Phil -<br><br>First, I don't believe that your point in posting this article was to get drawn into a dialog / argument with a religious nutcase. I don't believe that was the intention of the person who originally wrote it, either. I think both of you were expressing frustration with the intolerant, hypocritical religious right.<br><br><br><br>I completely agree with you on that. I'm fed up with religious people trying to impose their morals on others.<br><br><br><br>I'll reply to your questions with my personal beliefs. Since this is a humor post and my comments are way off topic, feel free to delete both my comments if you'd like.<br><br>1. The entire Bible tells a story. Just as one sentence out of context may not convey the whole meaning, the first half of the story without the second doesn't make sense. The Old Testament is like the first half of a cliffhanger.<br><br>2. The requirements of the Old Testament law were fulfilled by the New Testament. In some ways, the requirements and enforcers of the Old Testament law are the villains of the New Testament story.<br><br>3. The stringent legalistic requirements of the Old Testament law were replaced by something a lot more difficult to follow (e.g. love your enemies, turn the other cheek, etc.). The New Testament law, in a nutshell, requires us to love others more than ourselves. No one honestly wants to do that, so we try to change the subject back to moralism.<br><br>4. Jesus lived a perfect life and died to fulfil the requirements of the law. He wasn't an example, he was _the_ sacrifice to end all sacrifices.<br><br>5. Most modern religious people selectively use portions of the Bible to force others to adhere to their religious moralism rather than focus on following the hard laws themselves.<br><br>6. Jesus didn't waste much time condemning immoral people. He spent most of his time attacking the heartless, moralistic, religious leadership of the time. He wasn't killed for telling people to try harder when it comes to following the rules, he was killed by the religious rulers for attacking religion.<br><br>7. Religious people throughout history do their best to bend Jesus' message into a moralistic set of rules they can use to control others and justify their own actions. This in no way tarnishes or changes the original message.<br><br><br><br>It would be ridiculous of me to assume I've got this stuff all figured out. The above is where I'm personally at right now. I know that a spirituality that that focuses on treating others with love and respect really resonates with me. I think it might be a little more welcome in the world than more moralistic hypocracy. <br><br><br><br>Again, though, I'm assuming you probably didn't post this because you wanted to discuss spirituality; you wanted to criticize the moralism that seeks to impose empty legalism on a country that's outgrown it years ago. I'm completely with you on that.<br><br><br><br>Two references on the beliefs I expressed above:<br><br><a href="http://shrinkster.com/1k1" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://shrinkster.com/1k1">http://shrinkster.com/1k1</a> - Brief discussion on Old Testament law in the New Testament<br><br><a href="http://shrinkster.com/1k2" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://shrinkster.com/1k2">http://shrinkster.com/1k2</a> - The book of Galatians (&lt;3100 words )<br><br><br><br>BTW, thanks for running such a great blog.
