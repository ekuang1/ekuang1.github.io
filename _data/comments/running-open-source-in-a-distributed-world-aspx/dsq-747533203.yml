message: <p>@Jakub Thanks! Yeah, I pointed that out, though after reading what I said, it sounds like I was saying the opposite. My point was that the reason Linux scales is that they moved to this hierarchical model you described. I doubt having a completely flat model would scale, and I think Linux is perhaps evidence of that.</p>
