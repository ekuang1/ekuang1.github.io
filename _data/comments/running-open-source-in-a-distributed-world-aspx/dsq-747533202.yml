message: "<p>Actually nowadays Linux kernel development scales quite well, thanks to the fact that with distributed version control system such as Git you can set up a <strong>network of trust</strong>, or in other words <em>hierarchical structure of repositories</em>.  For Linux kernel development it means Linus' <strong><em>lieutienants</em></strong> and <strong><em>subsystem repositories</em></strong> (and also repositories such as kernel janitors project with trivial patches).  Though there was LWN article about how said hierarchy of repositories in Linux development isquite shallow, and should be deeper to scale better.<br>Besides many OSS project accept not only pull requests (be it via email, or e.g. via GitHub message/notification system) or (rarely) pushes, but also sending patches (be it via email, or putting in issue tracker, or patch review board).  With distributed version control system a leaf / accidental / new contributor can clone a full repository and do his/her work with all the advantages of version control system, even if development of a feature takes more than one commit.  All that without need to contact main developers / maintainer / leader of said project.  The he/she can update his/her work to be on top of latest changes (in Git: <em>rebase</em>) and send <strong>series of patches</strong> to be reviewed, and ultimately (if they are accepted) applied.</p>"
