message: <p>I agree totally with your statement.  I think we have all fell into the design pattern trap.  We've all have also done the same thing when we first learned to use inheritance and threads!   <br><br><br><br>I think its a human behavior to abuse new ideas and things.  <br><br><br><br>Patterns are very good but when your forcing a pattern into something that may not need it make no sense.  I constantly have to remind my team of this when they are developing a new piece of code.  Since we get paid when things are delivered I have to make it very clear that the most important thing is to deliver high quality software on time.  If we do a good job and its delveried on time there is usually a good chance we will get repeat business and then can refactor in a pattern based on new requirements.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
