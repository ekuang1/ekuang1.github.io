message: <p>I completely agree.  In fact, I think the best way I use design patters is by writing my application without consciously thinking about patters, but more about just making it work.  Then I focus on implementing patters in the refactoring stage.  This is just but one reason why I love Joshua Kerievsky's book "Refactoring to Patterns".</p>
