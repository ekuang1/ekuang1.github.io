message: <p>Ah! At last! Thanks! This article put a bit of light in todays frustration at work.<br>I work with another developer who has this "Patterns always and everywhere" mentality, and damn it I could not explain my idea, which is exactly what you describe.<br>The result is that we have a myriad of classes to describe every single things, and a system that will never do even the simplest things just because it's too complex.<br>I started thinking I was completely wrong and did not understand anything in OO design, luckily enough I found your article.<br>I can go home happy now.</p>
