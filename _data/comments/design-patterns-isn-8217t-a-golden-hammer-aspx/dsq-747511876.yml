message: <p>I wouldn't go confusing patterns with principles. Coding to interfaces is a principle that doesn't cost much and can mean all the difference down the track. Just think of it as a natural part of design. For more details and justification you could refer to Item 16 of Josh Bloch's Effective Java.<br><br><br><br>Patterns are another matter, and should only be used where a demonstrated need exists. By all means hold back on them until refactoring.</p>
