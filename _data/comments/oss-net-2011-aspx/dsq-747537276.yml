message: <p>The open source fest at Mix was a blast, even if I wasn't eligible to win. Would love to bring POP Forums back next year (any volunteers for translating the resx files?), but it's looking like there won't be a Mix 2012. Bummer. I went to most of them, and it was a fantastic conference.</p>
