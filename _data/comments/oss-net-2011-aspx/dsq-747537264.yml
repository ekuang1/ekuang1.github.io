message: <p>@haacked <br>You haven't mentioned any of the other .NET web frameworks (i.e. OWIN-related) or any of the .NET NoSQL solutions, and only hand-picked a few of the Micro ORMs rather than pointing to a comparative lists like:<br><a href="http://yobriefca.se/blog/2011/06/21/microorms-for-dotnet-inserts-updates-deletes/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://yobriefca.se/blog/2011/06/21/microorms-for-dotnet-inserts-updates-deletes/">yobriefca.se/...</a><br>Granted you can't list everything or may not know these other .NET frameworks exist and are aware of their respective communities, which is why it's a better strategy to change the title of this post to reflect that it's "your" highlights.</p>
