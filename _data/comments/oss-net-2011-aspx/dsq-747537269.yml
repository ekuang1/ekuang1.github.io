message: <p>@Demis thanks for the links! Makes the post that much more valuable. I added a note in my introduction to this post that these are highlights in my opinion. At the same time, I did include your suggestions.<br>@Paul thanks, I added Nancy as well as mentions of Kayak, Manos de Mano, FubuMVC, etc.! Even better, I found a comparison of the various micro web framework with source code samples.<br>@Miguel I added some notes on that. Thanks!</p>
