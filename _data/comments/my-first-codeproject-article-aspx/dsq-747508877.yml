message: "<p>Welcome to CodeProject, you article is very nice and might even be using it in MbUnit :):)<br><br><br><br>Be aware, that CodeProject has gotten so big that it has become very noisy: lots of crap article tend to lower it's value (Although Chirs and his team has putten up the \"purgatory\"). <br><br><br><br>In fact, if your article stays on the homepage for long, you will get a lot of hits on it (not to mention google ranking).  When you submit an article and it has less than 10 votes, it is in a critical stage. If any codeproject user votes negatively, it's ranking with dive and boom, it's forgotten...<br><br><br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Jonathan</p>"
