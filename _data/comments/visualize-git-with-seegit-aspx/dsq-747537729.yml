message: <p>Ha! This was one of the ideas someone submitted to us to do as a Code 52 project, and we hadn't gotten that far down the list yet - I was just pointing it out to the guys in the room yesterday (I stumbled across it checking out some of the Githubbers on Coderwall).<br>Looks great, and thanks for pointing out the Graph nugets - I've never done that sort of visualisation with WPF, and I was interested in seeing how it was done.</p>
