message: <p>I pushed my raw TODO list up there as well, hopefully there's something of value there. <br>One of the more ambitious ideas I had was to keep a copy of every displayed graph (effectively every repo update) so that you could step back and forth whilst demoing. <br>Rebases seems to take a while to get a grasp of so with this you could do the rebase, at which point the viewer show the after-the-fact graph and then you could use arrow keys or a slider to toggle between the before- and after graph.<br>Oh, and PS. Very nicely done Phil! I yield :) DS</p>
