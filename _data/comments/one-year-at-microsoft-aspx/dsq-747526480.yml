message: <p>congrats.  I was just thinking about the really good "industry hires" MS has brought in recently.  You're getting quite a lot of heavy weights there.<br>On the OT.. I was just in a small farm town in Ohio, and saw a sign for "Haack Farms".  Must have passed it 6 times while I was there, and each I said I'd take a pic. never did.  I thought it was interesting, but prolly noone else would.</p>
