message: <p>Putting on my "user" hat and not "project maintainer" hat, codeplex is way, way, way more user friendly to use than github.<br>Codeplex actually has a usable interface that looks good and has links to useful content -&gt; documentation, discussions, issue tracker, downloads, source code, etc - gihub doesn't.  Also you actually land at a frickin home page!  I can find out what the hell is up with the project, what it is, usage, etc.  Github dumps me at the code page which usually has little or no info.<br>Every time I have to use a github site I groan as it is so stark and usually bereft of any content at all regarding what the project is.  The design is so minimalist it might as well have been done by a blind unix programmer.<br>OK rant, over.<br>If the development side of github is so much better hopefully github can get its act together on the usage/community side - currently it sucks.  Conversely, what specifically does codeplex need to do on the project developer side?</p>
