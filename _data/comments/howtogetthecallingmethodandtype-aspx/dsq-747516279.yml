message: "<p><b>Pop Quiz</b>: Because reusing the code in that way would modify the stack and give you the wrong return (it would return whatever type contains the GetCallingType() method).<br>In physics this would fall under the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle where the act of measuring an electron's location actually modifies it's location.</p>"
