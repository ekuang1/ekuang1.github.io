message: <p>I think a bigger problem in the hiring process is just getting past HR to even get an interview. I've applied for positions and heard nothing. I've also reapplied at positions through a recruiter and at least got a phone interview. Resume writing has truly become a master out form. And recruiters have a job because you need someone to sweet talk you past HR because you have no idea what buzzwords they are keying of in resumes and cover letters.</p><p>But good post and I do think the interview hiring landscape is changing.</p>
