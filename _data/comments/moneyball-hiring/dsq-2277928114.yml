message: <p>I owned a software firm in the 80's.  Same problem.  We solved it by screening what we thought was the best, then sending them to a full afternoon with an outside psychologist.</p><p>He screened them for aptitude and personality fit.  Turnover went to zero and productivity soared.  Why? We ended up with a fairly homogeneous group of workers well suited to their jobs.  People wanted to be there and were capable of performing.</p><p>I remember one female candidate who he believed would be a poor fit because the support department she was applying for was all male and she had an underlying "hates men" personality trait. The doc was convinced the department would be at war within a week.</p><p>Best money we ever spent.</p>
