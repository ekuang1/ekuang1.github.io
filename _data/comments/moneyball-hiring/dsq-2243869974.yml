message: <p>saber works in the closed system of MLB because all the employers (MLB teams) are trying to achieve the same goals in roughly the same way with a very strict rule set (9 players, etc).  Thus they can come up with analysis that makes sense for each candidate.</p><p>Also baseball the sport, even though it's a team game, is largely made up of individual plays, especially on offense. Applying advanced statistical analysis to more team oriented sports (especially football &amp; basketball) has proven rather difficult, thought it's an evolving field.</p><p> Companies are so drastically different from sports with their rather stringent ruleset, and employee success mirrors the complex team dynamics of the other (non-mlb) team sports where success and failure are VERY hard to measure on an individual level (outside of absolute edge cases good or bad).  The same person at the same company solving the same problem the same way can (will?) have completely different outcomes just by altering the membership of the team they work with.</p><p>in short, noble effort, but damn good luck!  (also it's a famous saying that moneyball gets you to the playoffs, but not through them)</p>
