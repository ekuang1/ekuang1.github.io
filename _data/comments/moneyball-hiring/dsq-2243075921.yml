message: <p>I think the problem is that we don't really know how to "score" employees, so I'm not sure if the data would be useful. Stack ranking obviously doesn't work (as you want to stick hot pokers in your ears when you hear about "visibility" and "high potential"). In my experience, all of the brain teaser nonsense and white boarding is in fact useless, but purely as a gut check, I like to sit someone in front of a computer with real tools, Google available, and just see how they solve a problem. I mean, that's how we work, right? Beyond that, it's more important to understand if they play well with others.</p>
