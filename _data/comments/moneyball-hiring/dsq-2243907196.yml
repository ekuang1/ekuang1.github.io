message: <p>I really enjoyed this article. I would, however, caution against the using the logic in this quote to say that the questions were ineffective - because it doesn't prove so:</p><p>"Years ago, we did a study to determine whether anyone at Google is <br>particularly good at hiring. We looked at tens of thousands of <br>interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they <br>scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their <br>job. We found zero relationship."</p><p>There is a huge survivorship bias in this statement. The people who got hired *may* have hugely outperformed those who were rejected, but we'll never know because they didn't get hired.</p>
