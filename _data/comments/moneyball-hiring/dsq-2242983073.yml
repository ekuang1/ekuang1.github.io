message: "<p>I failed both onsite interviews with Microsoft and Google. Indeed, I can't \Pfind the path between\Pnodes \Pin \Pa \Pbinary tree on a whiteboard. I pretty much gave up my aspirations to work on one of those behemoths. It was very hard and I felt like a total failure, but now I acknowledge that those companies hire only the top of the top, and I am not on that tier (in all honestly, I feel like the only reason I made it that far on the interview process is because I am Hispanic, and they are desperate to pad their diversity numbers up. Realistically I don't think I ever had a chance to receive an offer). I like what you wrote, it always felt to me like they are interested in hiring the dogs that know how to perform certain tricks in certain way, because it is after all, the status quo. They hit and miss a lot, but at least it is a framework that gives them something to work with, even if they still miss the occasional fat catcher that gets on base a lot, because he doesn't fit their vision of what a true googler (or softie) should say at those interviews.</p>"
