message: <p>&gt; I think the problem is that we don't really know how to "score" employees, so I'm not sure if the data would be useful.</p><p>This can never be an exact science, and I don't claim it to be. But we can do better than what we do today.</p><p>We can make multiple hypotheses and then collect data, analyze the result, and see what we learn.</p><p>For example, the statement that data can't improve the hiring process is itself a hypothesis. Ok, so prove it! Let's do a study.</p><p>You say that brain teasers and white boarding is useless. The data agrees with you.</p><p>So far, the data seems to indicate that having people do the actual work they would in the job they're interviewing for is effective. That's promising, but we need more studies.</p><p>The point I'm advocating is that a lot of companies have a lot of data on this. We could take this shared data, categorize it, and look for any universal trends, and report on what we learn.</p><p>Maybe we learn that you're better off throwing a dart at a wall full of resumes. Maybe we learn a few things that work, and a few things that don't. Until then, we're mostly working with conjecture.</p>
