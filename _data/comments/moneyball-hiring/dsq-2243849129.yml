message: <p>I agree with the spirit, and I guess ultimate aim, of what your are saying. The crystal ball/tea leaf gazing practices are damaging or useless at best, but I'm having a hard time imagining the data which would solve this.</p><p>Can you give some concrete examples of the data points you would collect?</p><p>I'm not sure the analogy with baseball holds so well. Baseball is a highly constrained environment with very specific inputs (the actions you can take within the rules of the game) and desired outcomes (winning games). This doesn't describe software development very well.<br></p>
