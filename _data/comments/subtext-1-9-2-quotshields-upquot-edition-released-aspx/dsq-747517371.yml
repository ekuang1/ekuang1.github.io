message: <p>I ran the upgrade to 1.9.2 this morning and it worked flawlessly.  Thanks so much for this release, as I was getting bombarded with spam, which amazingly enough, all was coming from accounts with <a href="http://yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a>.<br><a href="http://Yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Yahoo.com">Yahoo.com</a> really needs to crack down on their services being used for spam.  <br>Again, thank you so much for this release.  You made my day.  :)<br>Best -<br>Braden</p>
