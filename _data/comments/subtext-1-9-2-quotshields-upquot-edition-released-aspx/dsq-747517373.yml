message: <p>@Simo, well in theory it can be cracked, but I haven't seen comment spammers using it in the wild.  The real problem with CAPTCHA is that it doesn't make sense to use them to filter trackbacks, since trackbacks are by definition automated.  Thus if you use CAPTCHA, you'll want to end up disabling trackbacks.<br>With Akismet, you can pretty much enable trackbacks.</p>
