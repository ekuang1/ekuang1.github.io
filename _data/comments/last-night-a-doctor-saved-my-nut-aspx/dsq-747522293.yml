message: <p>Ouch! Glad it was ok, less time on the stair master huh ;-)<br>I once read a story about a guy who needed operating on with this and I guess if the docs twist had not worked you would have been under the knife. I don't think this is likey to occur and any lasting damage has been done but do take it easy mate.</p>
