message: <p>Guys have got to take their Boys more seriously.<br>A serious medical condition is not something to laugh about. Articles like this, aim to inform men about their health, and it really isn't taken in the vein its intended.<br>When a guy's testicles are involved, everything becomes a big joke. A medical emergency, because it's related to a man's penis is a laughing matter.<br>Seems strange.<br>Now, lets all have a good laugh about Ovarian Cysts.</p>
