message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>one of my best friends also experienced the same thing last year but in his case he couldn't walk again so his girlfriend had to drive him to the hospital. He also had to be operated on his testicals so no twisting for him. Just to let you know, he recovered fully of it.<br>Grz, Kris.</p>
