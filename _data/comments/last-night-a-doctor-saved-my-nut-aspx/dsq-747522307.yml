message: <p>I had that when I was 15.  Woke up in the middle of the night with agonizing pain in my left nut.  Parents drove me to the hospital, where a nurse smeared my sack with cold blue goo for an ultrasound (not the first experience a man should have with a woman touching his balls), and an hour later I was unconscious while a doc cut it open and stitched the apparently free-spinning testicle in place (they're supposed to have an anchor to the scrotum to keep this sort of thing from happening, guess I lost the genetic lottery on that one).</p>
