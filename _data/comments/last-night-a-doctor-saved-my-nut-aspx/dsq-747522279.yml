message: <p>I know how you felt. Some months ago I had something like this, called 'Hydrocele Testis'. Well, to say truth I had this for about 6 years and in the months before I went to doctor it became really uncomfortable for me. So I went to an Urologist and he removed the water - three times I had to come back because it re-filled. The pain I had after this was the worst I ever had (9 from 10 on a scale). So I went to hospital and they said to me that it was time to come because the doctor maybe didnt see the infection inside that has build from his 'playing around'. Yeah, great eh? Well, I got operated and now everything is in normal size again and alive. <br>Well, the person who initially debugged me - it seems he had not really experience with it - maybe he should try to find a new version of brain to extend his 'debugging' functionalities. ;)<br></p>
