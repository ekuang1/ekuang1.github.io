message: <p>That's too funny Phil!   It's one thing if you were slashdotted or Wired did a piece.  But who the hell is Rockstar?? <br><br><br><br>Honestly, you probably sent him/her more traffic from your site today than he probably had all month!  I think it's him who should be paying you!  Considering the only person who ever left a comment on their blog is you!!!   <br><br><br><br>Maybe I should do a write about you also and get more people commenting on my blog besides you as well :)<br><br><br><br>Oh well we all can't be a famous as our pal Phil!!!<br><br><br><br>Rock on Dude!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
