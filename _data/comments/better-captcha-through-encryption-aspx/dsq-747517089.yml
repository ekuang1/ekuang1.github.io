message: <p>Pardon my ignorance, but I am new to .net. I didn't examine the source code closely enough to see it was a property.<br>I don't think I understand how I should be using this. I add the dll as a reference to my web site, then I import Subtext.Web.Controls.InvisibleCaptcha, then I am at a loss. I was able to use the encrypt and decrypt methods, but I am missing a great deal of the functionality of this great tool.</p>
