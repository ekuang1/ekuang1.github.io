message: <p>excellent and awesome news! I am so exicted with this new technology and I have already had a chance to play it out. My current host (<a href="http://asphostcentral.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asphostcentral.com">asphostcentral.com</a>) does support it and honestly speaking, I was amazed the the capability of MVC Framework.<br>I do not have to spend times to redirect my pages anymore as MVC provides a way to route all hte 404 Error Pages. This is just one of the fantastic feature in MVC Framework!!!</p>
