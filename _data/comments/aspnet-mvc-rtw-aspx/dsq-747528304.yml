message: <p>Congratulations guys! I've been a huge fan of the MVC Framework since the first 07 release and I gotta say - you guys never disappointed me once. From what I can tell, you revolutionized the way MS put out a product. By going grass-roots and bringing in the community for advise, you in essence truly let us help shape the next evolution to web development.<br>Thanks, and I look forward to watching it explode across the scene even more than it already has.<br>Chance</p>
