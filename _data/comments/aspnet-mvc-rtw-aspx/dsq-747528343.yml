message: <p>congratulation Phil Haack and all the team involved, Great Job!<br>it feels like it has been just yesterday when I was reading a "dark blog" with many many pictures (and many more comments) of one enthustiastic coder (not a noble Vice-President at that time;-) known as "Scott" all around the ASP.NET community and saying "seperation of concerns" at least 1000 times a minute;)<br>now we have a real metal but in our hands but somehow I fell I'll miss the betas, new ideas, developement cycle/changes/infos and so on (and so forth), strange...<br>still, it's great to have it, and forward to ASP.NET Futures!</p>
