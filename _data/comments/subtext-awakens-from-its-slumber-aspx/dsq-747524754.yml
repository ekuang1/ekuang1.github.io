message: <p>@joe brinkman I appreciate your perspective. I think I have identified people who can carry the banner in my absense. Simo, Steve, etc... Unfortunately, we all were slammed at the same time. :(<br>Since I do this for fun, I'm not bothered too much by people leaving. It'll be a fun goal to try and bring people back. :)</p>
