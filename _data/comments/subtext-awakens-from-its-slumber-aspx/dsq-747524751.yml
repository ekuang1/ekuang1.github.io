message: <p>Glad to hear that development has resumed.  Unfortunately I made the decision a week ago to switch to BlogEnging.Net.  One thing that is tough in Open Source is that if a project appears to go dormant then users will eventually leave.  While I certainly appreciate the desire, I fear the reality of Redmond will kick in again and SubText will once again run silent and deep.  I would suggest that the best thing you could do for the project is to focus on identifying a team that can carry on in your absense.</p>
