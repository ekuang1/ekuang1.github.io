message: "<p>Phil: Interesting point.  Hopefully my handle is quite obviously innocent.  Doesn't everybody want a comment from \"Haacked\"?  Hmmm... that might scare some people. I may have to start using \"Haacked aka Phil\".<br><br><br><br>Chris: Sir Jack, trust me, I've had my share of nicknames.  In college and highschool, my soccer teammates addressed me by clearing their throats as if they were going to \"Haack\" up a loogie.</p>"
