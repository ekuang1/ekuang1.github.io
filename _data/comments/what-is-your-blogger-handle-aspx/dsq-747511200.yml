message: <p>I was NEVER good about making up names. My BBS handle was Jer, a nickname I got from someone in high school. That stuck for a short while until I tried to come up with something decent for IRC (since Jer was taken a million times by a million other Jeremys). <br><br><br><br>I know it's you when you sign Haacked, but some people could percieve that as a spam bot misspelling a word to try to trick various spam catching techniques. When I first saw it I thought "hrm, possible spammer?" Then when I realized you had a blog and what haacked actually means to you, it became a little more clear. <br><br><br><br>I guess it's good to know I'm not the only one who came up with a handle based upon parts of a first/last name. I'm not the only un-original bastage in this world, hurray!</p>
