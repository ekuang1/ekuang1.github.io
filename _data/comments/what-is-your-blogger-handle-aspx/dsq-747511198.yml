message: <p>Mine was the Computer Kid.  Yeah it was stupid but at the time I was only 12 and I had my 300 Baud modem for my Commodore 64 called the Pocket Modem.  This openned a whole new world fo me.  I was living up in Edmonton, Canada and I found this monthly newspaper in the city on computers called CompuRun.  It had a list of BBS's on the back.  There was over 50 at the time and I would be on them all day when I could. <br><br><br><br> I even had my own BBS that I wrote the software for it.  Back then I got a book on Modems and figure out how to write to the Modem.  In Basic for the Commodore 64/128 you would use Print#15 to send data to the modem (Don't ask me how I remember this but I still do because I probably did 1 million print#15 lines)<br><br><br><br>Those were the days! I'm not sure if I consider BBSs the same as blogging but its pretty close.  Newsgroups felt more like the BBS days.</p>
