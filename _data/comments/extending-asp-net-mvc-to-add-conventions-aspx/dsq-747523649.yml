message: <p>Phil,<br>This post was EXACTLY what I personally was looking for. I must admit that I haven't looked at the framework enough yet and I should have dove deeper before I made a post asking questions. Next time I will be sure to do my research first.<br>Now that you have described that this is very easy to accomplish I personally am satisfied. I don't think there is any point of talking about the matter any further. I'm sure once the CTP comes out I'll have many more things to pick at =)<br>@David<br>This type of thinking and labeling people as part of a particular community is hurting more then it is helping. We really need to get past this mindset if we want to progress and move forward. In addition, I really feel we should not be labeling people as "morts" anymore. This is very counter-productive and doesn't help anyone as a whole. Call me what you will but let's try to keep the sweeping stereotype's to a minimum please. This will help everyone out =)</p>
