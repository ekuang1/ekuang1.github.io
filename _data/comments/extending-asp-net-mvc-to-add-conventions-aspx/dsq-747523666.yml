message: <p>Yes, it is nice that you have the flexibility to do that. On the other hand, the attribute makes it safe and is consistent with the rest of the framework, which are IMO good reasons to have it there.<br>Also, great flexibility and 'convention over configuration' are somewhat contradictive.<br>cheers<br>Florian</p>
