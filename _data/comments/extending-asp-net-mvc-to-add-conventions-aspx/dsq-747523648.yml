message: <p>Personally I don't find the attribute thing to be a big deal, and it seems a surprising thing to get bent over.  Don't you run into the same sort of thing with AOP in various places?  (This is a serious question, not rhetorical)<br><br>"It adds a lot of extra typing for no real benefit."<br>I do think this coming from the ALT.NETinati is pretty funny, in line of the "roll eyes" attitude when Mort says the same of DI.  (and yes, that is a completely unfair apples and oranges comparison but I still find it hilarious)<br>One other thing:<br>Controller is going to be in System.Web.Extensions right?</p>
