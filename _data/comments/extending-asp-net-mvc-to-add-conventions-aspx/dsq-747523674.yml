message: <p>OK, let me observe.<br>I mean really, don't most developers out there have any sort of life?  Not even 10%? Go have some "guacamole" and watch a football game and get away from code for once in your life and quit bitching about such stupid sh**.  Who cares about this lousy attribute!  Just use it and go home and enjoy your life!!!  Find a girlfriend, get married, go to a strip bar, start a side business.  You only live once...I'm sure there is far better use of your time everyone then debating a simple requirement such as this.  If you have that much time, do what Phil says, go and reinvent MVC every weekend.  Just use it and maybe improved it but damn, I mean really.  I have far better things to do with my time.<br>- Dave</p>
