message: <p>@Sean I appreciate you being civil and apologizing Sean. It really elevates the level of discourse. It's funny, as we get closer to the CTP, I've noticed better discourse in several forums I'm in. ;)<br>As for the exact date, I'm afraid to say anything in case some last minute thing comes up again. How's "sometime soon" for an answer?</p>
