message: <p>"Call me what you will..."<br>I just used your quote since it was the best one-line representation of what I've perceived as a general attitude, no need to martyr yourself. :) <br>It was just something I thought was funny (although completely unfair, as I pointed out), and was trying to use "domain language" to get across my meaning.  Anyway, the post-mortem will reveal that I made a low-content post that ultimately did more harm than good.  Sorry about that, I plead boredom while waiting on the ctp and now return you to productive discussion.<br></p>
