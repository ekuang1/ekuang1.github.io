message: <p>This worked great, however I am running into an issue with dependencies. Using the package explorer I added a dependency to jquery. (Actually it happens with any dependency) <br>I see the package fine in visual studio, however when I go to install I get "unable to resolve dependency".<br>If I remove the dependencies the package installs fine.</p>
