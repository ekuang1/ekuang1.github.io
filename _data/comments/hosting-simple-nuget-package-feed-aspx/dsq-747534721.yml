message: <p>I realy like this solution, but I don't get it. Keep getting the 404 error. I made sure having the  &lt;modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true"&gt; entry in web.config. <br>Published the site to IIS 7 and added the mimetype as suggested by haacked. <br>Anyone any other suggestion?       please....</p>
