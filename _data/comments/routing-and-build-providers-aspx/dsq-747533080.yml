message: "<p>This seems like a lot of work to just remove the .svc extension. Ron Jacobs has a better example on his website (<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rjacobs/archive/2010/04/05/using-system-web-routing-with-data-services-odata.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rjacobs/archive/2010/04/05/using-system-web-routing-with-data-services-odata.aspx\">blogs.msdn.com/...</a>). The beauty is it's only 2 lines of code and you don't even need the .svc file! Check out this post on how to remove the file (<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rjacobs/archive/2010/04/08/wcf-data-services-odata-and-eliminating-the-svc-file.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rjacobs/archive/2010/04/08/wcf-data-services-odata-and-eliminating-the-svc-file.aspx\">blogs.msdn.com/...</a>).<br>Note: I'm not sure this applies to every instance but I've definitely been using it for WCF Data Services.</p>"
