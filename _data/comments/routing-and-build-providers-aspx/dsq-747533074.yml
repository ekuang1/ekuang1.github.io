message: "<p>I had a similar approach list week; I was having trouble registering an asset.axd httphandler from web.config. It should be straight forward, but you know, I was using MVC2, Telerik MVC extensions for MVC and all was running on Linux, apache2 with mod_mono. <br>As much as I think it ____ROCKS____ that all this works, I was prepared to accept the idea that a few minor incompatibilities might exist in the web server configuration area... and I wasn't prepared to switch to bleeding edge versions to see whether it was fixed. So.... I removed the items in web config and instead added the following bit of gunk in my MVC application routing table:<br><code><br>routes.Add(new Route(\"asset.axd\", new RouteAssetHttpHandler()));<br></code><br>with RouteAssetHttpHandler defined as a simple wrapper around the httpHandler<br><code><br>public class RouteAssetHttpHandler : IRouteHandler<br>{<br>IHttpHandler IRouteHandler.GetHttpHandler (RequestContext requestContext)<br>{<br>return new Telerik.Web.Mvc.WebAssetHttpHandler();<br>}<br>}<br></code><br>Worked like a charm!<br>(no preview, so please don't hit me if the formatting is screwed up)</p>"
