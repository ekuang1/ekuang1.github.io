message: <p>I think RTFM is the most difficult and interesting part in a developers life. Every day something new is coming and you have to remain updated while working on it. one gathers only that much information what ever is needed to make a piece of code working or to make use of that tool.<br>I have found that people who read a little more becomes so called technically fundoo people and rest becomes managers. <br>So its always a confusion how to RTFM.</p>
