message: <p>After working on the original DotNetNuke book, I thought that I would spend some time reading it.  Over a year later I still find things in that book that I never knew about the software.  Just a couple of weeks ago I was explaining to Shaun about a certain feature, finally I just gave him a page reference back to the book.  Even though we both are active on the project it is not possible to know all the ins-and-outs of such a large product.  Writing the book helped solidify my knowledge in a few areas while highlighting my total lack of knowledge in others.<br>Whatever you do, have fun during the writing, and just remember that your publisher will always want your chapter "yesterday", but is always willing to accept it "tomorrow".</p>
