message: <p>Hmmm...<br>I tend to view UML in the same light as design patterns.  <br>Developers implement the standard GoF or PoEAA design patterns every day.  But most developers don't know that they've implemented the patterns.  Similarly, developers and designers probably use a crude form of UML every day (whiteboard sessions) but probably don't know that they're speaking (crudely) the language of UML.<br>This causes a problem only in communication of what has been designed/implemented.  It's much easier to communicate ideas with a simple, standard set of abstractions ("I implemented Table Data Gateway for persisting Orders" or "I'm using a Memento to maintain state for the Cart") than to try explain exactly what you implemented with all of the gory details.<br>Similarly, it's easier to make good use of UML as a standard modelling language.  To you and your team, a squiggly line might mean inheritance; to the new contractor on your team, the squiggly line means "WTH?" :D<br>As with design patterns, I feel that you can only derive value from UML if you learn the "language".  I simply think that no one wants to learn UML.  More importantly, *everyone* on your team has to learn UML for it to make any impact, which can also be said of design patterns.<br>As for why people don't want to learn UML?  That, I have a harder time answering :D<br>** By the way, the live comment preview feature is nice, but terribly slow in FireFox.  Perhaps you should only render a buffered delta using the position of the cursor as a sync point?</p>
