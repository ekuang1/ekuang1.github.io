message: <p>I think that one of the reasons that leads to this difference is the distance between the details of implementaion in a circuit and a software.<br>If you draw UML diagrams just paid time and have strucutre but this is aproximately nothing because you should code this and most of work is this.<br>But in a circuit when you draw the diagram don't need to work hard to implement details. Just you should do it and it doesn't seem to be complicated.<br>So at the end for a software after drawing your diagrams, you have nothing except a schema but for circuits you did at least half of work!<br>On the other hand the process of drawing UML diagrams is harder than circuit diagrams, I think.<br>And I'm agree that UML is not obvious and you can't teach it easily.</p>
