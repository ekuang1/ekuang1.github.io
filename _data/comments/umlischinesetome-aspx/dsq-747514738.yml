message: <p>Right. UML seems divided into two paths. Either it is useful for high level architecture <em>sketches</em> in which case it needs to shed alot of weight.<br>Or it will become a language in and of itself (albeit a symbol based rather than text based), in which case it will grow immensely and become just another executable programming language.  <br>This would solve the round tripping problem, but introduce brand new issues.<br></p>
