message: <p>Seriously MS needs to slow down the release cycles just a tad.  <br>As soon as MVC3 is released (March 2011?) it will only be out in the wild for a year then there's a newer version to contest with in 2012.  Why don't you have longer release cycles?  With a longer release cycle maybe you can fit more features into each release rather than creating smaller and more frequent releases.<br>Just like the iPhone, buy a new one today then it will be out of date come this time next year.<br>How can anyone ever keep up!</p>
