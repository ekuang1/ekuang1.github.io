message: <p>Although I like the OutputCache attribute one way it could be improved would be to be able to programatically remove entries from the cache by using a key generated by the UrlHelper instead of the LocalPath of an actual Uri. <br>HttpResponse.RemoveOutputCacheItem(Url.Action(...)) would simplyfy working with the OutputCache a lot.</p>
