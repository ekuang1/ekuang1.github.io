message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>We have a problem with DRY and Anti-Forgery token in ASP.NET MVC . Good description could be found here <br><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/srkirkland/archive/2010/04/14/guarding-against-csrf-attacks-in-asp-net-mvc2.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://weblogs.asp.net/srkirkland/archive/2010/04/14/guarding-against-csrf-attacks-in-asp-net-mvc2.aspx">weblogs.asp.net/...</a><br>   <br>but as one commenter said - "To me, I see no reason for this. You still have to remember to put the &lt;%= Html.AntiForgeryToken() %&gt; in the form. I guess if you forget, you will get an error since it will check for it by default... but in this case, I'd rather have it automatically added to my form as well. Also, I think I'd rather see each action explicitly have the [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute, just so I (or another developer) know what's going on. Less DRY? Sure. Easier to understand? Yes!<br>Adding the one extra attribute isn't enough to make me want to DRY it up. Even if it is on every POST. But, again, I'd rather have the option to just use it by default in the form and controller - this is how Rails works."<br>Would be really cool to fix this really annoying issue in future releases.<br>Thanks</p>
