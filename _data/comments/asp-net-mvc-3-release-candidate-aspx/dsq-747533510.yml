message: <p>@CubanX, @BluCoder<br>Hey guys, I think I found the issue.. You have to uninstall the MVC 3 and Web Pages from your machine, but one thing I missed is the NuPack. The Beta 1 installer also installed it, and it has since been renamed to NuGet. Once I uninstalled NuPack, I managed to install the hotpatch without a hitch ^_^</p>
