message: <p>Hi,<br>I think syntax hilite/intellisense is great Razor, but some work needs to be done on speeding it up. I have a file with just 800 lines of declarative @helpers, and you can feel already this is a very heavy job for the real-time parser/hiliter. The delay between the keystrokes can reach 2 seconds.</p>
