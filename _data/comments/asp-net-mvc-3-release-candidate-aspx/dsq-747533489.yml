message: '<p>Love the idea of MVC and am looking forward to installing the RC.<br>One suggestion, if I may: before concentrating on MVC4, have the team concentrate on building some killer documentation / tutorials and updating the MVC site to contain them. I think it will help bridge the gap between devs focused on standard .NET development, and it certainly would make picking it up for new folks new to MVC (like mysef) a lot easier.<br>With that said though, very excited for MVC 3!</p>'
