message: <p>Haven't seen the movie, but there's a Twilight Zone episode where a man has a similar watch and he uses it to stop time and rob a bank. As he's wheeling the money out of the bank, the watch falls and breaks and he's forever stuck in the world in between seconds.</p><p>That episode really bothered me and I've thought about it once or twice per month for the past few years. Thanks for bringing up bad memories :D</p>
