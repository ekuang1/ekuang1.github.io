message: <p>Phil,</p><p>If you're goal was to not worry about hosting and so forth, what made you choose GitHub Pages over say <a href="http://wordpress.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> and using a custom domain?</p><p>I'm imagining a scenario in the future where you might want to customise your blog in some way and GitHub Pages is going to make that difficult. If you went to <a href="http://wordpress.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> initially but later decided that you wanted to self-host WordPress for increased customisation - it'd be an easy exercise.</p><p>Interested to hear your decision making process on it.</p><p>Al.</p>
