message: <p>I like that people can send pull requests now to my blog posts should they want and everything is hosted in Git.</p><p>And if I needed a customization not supported by GitHub Pages, I _always_ have the option to just use Jekyll plugins on my local machine and push the generated output to GitHub pages. That's the Octopress approach.</p>
