message: <p>Yes, the backward compatibility issue is an interesting one. I have the feeling that some breaking changes (and not minor ones) will be necessary.</p><p>But, I think/hope the community will not be bothered too much is some things break if in return we get a new and improved ASP.NET architecture/API with some old issues solved and some old baggage is thrown away.</p>
