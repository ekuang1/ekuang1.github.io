message: <p>The ASP.NET history is very important, as reviewing how WebForms was designed, and why MVC was introduced, and why WCF Web API becomes ASP.NET Web API, and why finally we have MVC/Web API unified to a single model can significantly reveal the evolution of the Microsoft web stack. In the past, such information is fragmented and hidden behind the lines of articles such as <a href="http://www.iis.net/learn/application-frameworks/building-and-running-aspnet-applications/aspnet-20-breaking-changes-on-iis" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.iis.net/learn/application-frameworks/building-and-running-aspnet-applications/aspnet-20-breaking-changes-on-iis">http://www.iis.net/learn/ap...</a> and <a href="http://www.asp.net/whitepapers/aspnet4/breaking-changes" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.asp.net/whitepapers/aspnet4/breaking-changes">http://www.asp.net/whitepap...</a>. That frightens developers who do not follow the trend as closely as the pioneers. The more everyone knows of the evolution and history, the better they know at which stage their projects are, and in which direction they should move on. Looking forward to your next post.</p>
