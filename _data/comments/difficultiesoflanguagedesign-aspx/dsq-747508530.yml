message: <p>Thomas, the problem with your "On Error Resume Next" Kill() example is that you are ignoring all errors, not just "File Not Found"... so if your Kill fails because you have insufficient access rights, the file was in use, or any other issue, then you've just acted like it was successful without anyway to know that.<br><br><br><br>I understand the thought process behind writing that routine in that fashion, I just think it assumes too much (that only one possible error can occur from Kill()). Based on your description of what you want to happen, you really want to catch any error then ignore FileNotFound, but otherwise raise the error onto the caller...<br><br><br><br>The other two DeleteFile examples would produce that result I believe, so they are certainly better examples although I personally am always bothered by 'Exit' statements (they seem too much like GoTos to me) so I'd probably write;<br><br><br><br>Public Sub DeleteFile(ByVal aFilename As String) <br><br>  If Dir(aFilename) &lt;&gt; "" Then<br><br>      Kill aFilename <br><br>  End If<br><br>End Sub <br><br></p>
