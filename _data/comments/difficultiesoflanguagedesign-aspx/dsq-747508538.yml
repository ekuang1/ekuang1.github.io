message: <p>One thing I've been comtemplating recently is the concept of modular language. Currently function libraries serve as vocabulary and syntax serves as grammar. While vocabulary regularly changes, syntax stays the same. Now the question becomes, why don't we take the same approach to syntax that we do with function libraries.<br><br><br><br>The answer is we do to a limited extent now with the CLR. However given this miraculous, 2-Tiered compilation system why don't we take it a step further and introduce syntax modules. The concept would allow the introduction of new syntax in a limited space. If I need a simplified XML syntax, I just import the new syntax and within the confines of my function, I can code in a more usable fashion.<br><br><br><br>Remember given the new concept of VM's only the IM has to transfer, compiler's don't. There's little reason to have compilers on multiple platforms. Why would you? Why not just have a platform dedicated to compilation. Can you say hardware accelerated compilers? :)<br><br><br><br>I think it's time language designers took full advantage of the new 2-Tiered design that they've created.<br><br><br><br>Orion Adrian</p>
