message: <p>Thomas, I think you didn't understand me. What I've said is that On Error Goto 0 will swallow any previous and future errors. It's the previous errors part that I worry about. This causes the DeleteFile function, as written, to have a unwanted side-effect.<br><br>The correct name for the function should be DeleteFileAndClearAllErrors()<br><br></p>
