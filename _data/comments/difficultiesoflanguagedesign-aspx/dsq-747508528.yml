message: "<p>Not catching an exception is *not* a bad habit. Swallowing it could be, if you are not doing it for a reason.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps there is no need to catch the exception. Why should I, if I don't have any information to add? What if I don't care? It could be an exception for the library developer, but it doesn't have to for me.<br><br><br><br>The Kill statement in VB6, which is used to delete files, will raise an error if the file doesn't exist. I have discussed with people why this is an error. From my point of view, I just want the file to go away. If it's already gone, fine! Mission accomplished. To others, this is a technical thing: How can you delete something which is not there? It's impossible, hence it is an error.<br><br><br><br>Add the fact that VB6 does not have a FileExists function. So to create a useful way to delete files, I need to:<br><br><br><br>Public Sub DeleteFile(ByVal aFilename As String)<br><br>On Error Resume Next<br><br>Kill aFilename<br><br>On Error Goto 0<br><br>End Sub<br><br><br><br>- or -<br><br><br><br>Public Sub DeleteFile(ByVal aFilename As String)<br><br>If Dir(aFilename) = \"\" Then Exit Sub<br><br>Kill aFilename<br><br>End Sub<br><br><br><br>- or -<br><br><br><br>Public Sub DeleteFile(ByVal aFilename As String)<br><br>If FileLen(aFilename) = 0 Then Exit Sub<br><br>Kill aFilename<br><br>End Sub<br><br></p>"
