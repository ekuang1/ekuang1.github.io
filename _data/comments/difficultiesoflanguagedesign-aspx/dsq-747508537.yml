message: <p>Daniel, you are correct about On Error Goto 0. That's exactly why I use it. When I use On Error Resume Next to swallow an error, that's the thing to do. I have had even harder bugs to find, because of a missing On Error Goto 0. Errors can then leak out where they don't belong and make something else to fail.</p>
