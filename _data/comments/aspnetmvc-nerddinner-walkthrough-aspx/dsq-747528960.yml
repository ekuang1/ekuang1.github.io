message: <p>Phil, I know you all work for Microsoft but I wonder why you aren't pushing people harder towards MVC.  I would be dismayed if only 5% of <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> users adopt the MVC framework.  <br>In my opinion, WebForms is only good for smaller sites, intranet sites and such.  I think MVC is a huge step in the right direction from Microsoft and should be promoting it as such.</p>
