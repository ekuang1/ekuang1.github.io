message: <p>I'm assuming it's a Redmond based position. The post I linked to has more information. I would leave specific questions regarding HR issues there as I'm not qualified to answer.<br>I can answer questions about my own experiences of working at Microsoft (what I'm allowed to say) as well as the location of the coffee machine nearest me and just how much sugar and milk I like. ;)</p>
