message: "<p>In my experience your comments are accurate. Most job postings are bland and focus only on experience, skills and responsibilities. Heck, I've been involved in the hiring process for a few years now and I'm guilty of using the same cookiecutter job description template as everyone else. Shame on me, right? Well, I will give myself some credit. I do request team players with strong verbal and written communication skills and a willingness to learn.  But these are only secondary criterion.  First and foremost, I evaluate a candidate's experience and it is their technical know-how which lands them a phone screening.  In the end, however, it's the \"soft skills\" which get the individual hired. <br>Here's my poor man's trackback: <a href=\"http://johnnycoder.com/blog/?p=63\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://johnnycoder.com/blog/?p=63\">http://johnnycoder.com/blog...</a></p>"
