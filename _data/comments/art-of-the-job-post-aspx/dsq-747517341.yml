message: <p>I probably could have written this post in much fewer words. My main point is this:<br>You'll have plenty of opportunities to filter out poor candidates later.  Use the job posting to attract the stars you hope to hire.  If you don't then your job posting is only going to bring in resumes you don't care about.<br>Requesting team players is not enough. Everyone thinks they are a team player.  In short, I think recruiting is always a two way street. As much as the candidate should impress the company, the company should also try and impress the candidate.</p>
