message: <p>Unfortunately, the people that know what they're doing also have to insert the flashey buzzwords into resumes as most of the hiring done here seems to be mostly recruiter based.  This means they go through a search engine of sorts to pull out resumes that match the keyword.  I'd rather have an offer for an interview for a COBOL position than not (I know nothing about COBOL).<br>The problem is further compounded by people that need some sort of "experience" which is measured in years.  I find it absolutely hilarious when I end up teaching those with 10 years of "experience" to my lowly 4.  With certain spurts of my career I was doing boring ass repetitive work while learning next to nothing.  The next month I learned some new stuff.  Do I still get to count that prior month as experience?  Everyone else does.<br>It's like you need a grey beard and all of a sudden people will think you're the senior of the seniors and know everything by default.  We todd did I say.  Oh and TGIF!</p>
