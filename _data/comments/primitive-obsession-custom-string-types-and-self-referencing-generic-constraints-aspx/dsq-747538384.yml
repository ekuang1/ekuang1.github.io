message: <p>I don't know, it's a question. But here are some more reasons for the question... HtmlString has no implicit conversion, why did you decide against it at the time? In Orchard, we have LocalizableString that we use everywhere, and we briefly played with implicit conversion and went back because it was creating hard to debug problems for our users down the line. I wrote a full library for path manipulation (<a href="http://fluentpath.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://fluentpath.codeplex.com">http://fluentpath.codeplex.com</a>) that seems close to what you are doing here, but after playing with implicit conversions, I again decided against it but kept explicit conversions and type converters because well, they are quite nice and they are explicit. But implicit conversions always seemed to backfire in my experience. But I would gladly concede that maybe I was doing it wrong.<br>As for dynamic languages, it seems to me like you would simply mix some additional behavior into a regular string and be done with it, with a lot less fuss. More and more, when I'm doing something that looks both exciting and dangerous in C#, I wonder if I would even attempt something similar in JavaScript or if the problem is just a workaround for self-inflicted statically-typed rigidity. It often is in my experience.<br>That's my question in a few more words :)</p>
