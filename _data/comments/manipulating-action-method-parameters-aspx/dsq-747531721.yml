message: <p>No one in here is working on a site with 100k content pages where having a properly indexed friendly URL column on the page table is going to cause any performance concerns hitting the database looking for a friendly URL instead of an ID.<br>Instead of passing the ID around, use the "slug" as you call it.<br>There's no need for "two database hits" looking for the value for the "slug" then using the ID to get the content.</p>
