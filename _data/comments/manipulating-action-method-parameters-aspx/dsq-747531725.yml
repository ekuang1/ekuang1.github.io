message: <p>I believe it's much more easy to implement this url<br><a href="http://site.com/some-text-32/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://site.com/some-text-32/">http://site.com/some-text-32/</a><br>this url contains id at the end, and text so it's easy to implement using ASP.NET MVC and it's good for Search engines.</p>
