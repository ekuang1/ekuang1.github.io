I want to fill this dictionary by using "reflection". Match patamers names with those names in attribute i.e City and Country, But NOT "Id" because Id is not loggable(according to the rule defined by the attribute). <br>*/<br>//Now take those loggable parameters and fill dictionary so that<br>//Dictionary first entry should be: <br>//[ Key = "City", Value ="New york" ] { The  value newyork will be //sent by the caller of the method. } <br>//Dictionary second entry should be: <br>//[ Key = "Country", Value ="USA" ] { The  value USA will be sent by //the caller of the method. } <br>}<br></p>'
