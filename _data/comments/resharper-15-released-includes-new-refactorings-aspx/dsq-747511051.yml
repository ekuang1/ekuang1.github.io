message: <p>Ha ha... Beta 2 should be out any time with a Go-Live license. I'll wait then and try to convince my clients to do likewise.  But until I have a project that requires .NET 2.0, I'm afraid to give myself the luxury that VS.NET 2005 provides. I'll grow lazy and soft and have trouble using VS.NET 2003 for real work. ;)<br><br><br><br>As for little blog posting, mainly it's been because I've been spending more time researching insurance, tax law, contracts, etc...  Maybe I should blog about that, but I figured it's boring stuff.  <br><br><br><br>Also, I need to figure out what is acceptable to blog about with each new client.  I hope to continue blogging as a source of professional development, but I won't do it on client time.  I'll stop the clock if I want to do it during the day.</p>
