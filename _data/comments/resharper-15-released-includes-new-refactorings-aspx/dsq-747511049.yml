message: <p>why you still developing in Visual Studio 2003 anyways?  Come get with it  and use use 2005 beta 1!! :)<br><br><br><br>I have to check this product out.  I have been developing a product for the last 5 months in 2005 and have grown to love the refactoring additions to 2005!<br><br><br><br>Hey I also noticed that you are posting very little on your blog these days. Maybe because now because its on your dime you not willing to spend the time  :)  To me it always amazing on how many blogs are updated on company time and very little is done on the weekends. Its like this one site I developed where the majority of the hits were the first thing in the morning and at lunch.  When it was after work the hits drop off a ton and very little traffic on the weekends.<br><br></p>
