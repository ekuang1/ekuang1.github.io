message: <p>That's totally *not* awesome in my aggregator!<br>And those non-skippable image transition animations are like nails on a chalkboard to me. Oh man. I'm ready for the next image before the darn animation has barely begun!<br>Also, I hate to be critical, but what's with the explosion of Google ads on this site? I can appreciate that you need to defray hosting costs, but..<br>Never mind, I think I'll stick with the aggregator after all. kthx bye.</p>
