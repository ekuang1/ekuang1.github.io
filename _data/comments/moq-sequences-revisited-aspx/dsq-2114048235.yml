message: <p>I think you missed the point of this extension. If you are given an array of values to return, you can't use the default "chaining" you described.</p><p>This helps most when writing Theories in XUnit. I can provide an array of return values in the TheoryData, then use this extension, because I don't know what the values are until runtime.</p>
