message: <p>Marriage (as we know it in the USA) was borrowed from the Bible.  The US government decided to formally recognize this Christian institution to encourage it.  The institution of marriage as given to us in the New Testament (two folks together until they die, never marrying another until they are seperated until death) was good to create stable societies with growing populations.  So needless to say, recognition and encouragement of this institution happened early in our nation's history.  The government has allowed many things in their administration of marriage that the Bible did not originally intend, but then again, so has the church.<br>The church may have made a huge mistake when allowing government to handle an institution that was theirs to regulate in the first place.  Government has been allowed by churches to take over the "process" of marriages which leaves marriage without the Spirit it should hold.</p>
