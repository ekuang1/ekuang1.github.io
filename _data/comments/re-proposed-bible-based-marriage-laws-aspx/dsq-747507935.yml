message: <p>Hey Bro, thanks for commenting and bringing context to the verses quoted in the article out of context.  However, I think you're taking their point too literally and missing the key point.<br><br><br><br>The post was meant to be partly tongue-in-cheek and partly to point out the mistake in attempting to amend the constitution with Bible based laws.  There's a very good reason we have a separation of church and state, and selectively choosing Bible verses to enforce (and not to enforce) as law both violates the separation, and is an affront to the Bible itself.<br><br><br><br>I'm sure you agree that the Bible wasn't meant to be followed selectively, but in whole.  Likewise, as Jesus himself said, "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. And render unto God what is His"<br><br><br><br>For example, read the following post and tell me if we should pass an amendment <br><br><a href="http://haacked.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/archive/2004/02/27/214.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://haacked.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/archive/2004/02/27/214.aspx">http://haacked.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/archive/2004/02/27/214.aspx</a> to disallow divorces.  When read in context, these verses clearly point out the Bible's stance on divorce, and though a slick talking pastor can try to work around the issue, it doesn't hold much water.</p>
