message: <p>umm good points i guess, but doesnt the rest of the story explain it?  Wasnt what the sisters did not what God wanted. They got their father drunk and it doesnt say this is what you shall do.its a story of what 2 sisters did to preserve thier line,, wheres the rest of the story?   Wasnt it only kings that had the concubines, which not making it right but is not saying it is something everyone should do.  Also The man if proven to lie about her virginity  would have been punished.  but culturally thats the harshness of being promiscous, it was greatly stressed to keep pure and the law, a great deal different to todays standards where virginity is as cheap as the quarter slots.  Were these also stories that God approves of and says we should follow these ways, or are they old testament lessons we should learn from.   and when he came he set the new laws in the new testament.  Can we use these to disregard all the other commands directly given from God.  Is it enough to mock the Bible and say its ridiculous?   i myself am pretty ignorant but not ready to rely on my own intelligence or interpetations of the Bible by biased people who only use half the story of a book.   but i guess being open to what the Bible says makes me pretty close minded..  this is not towards you  but to the people that wrote the article.. love you tons!  <br><br>Brian&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>
