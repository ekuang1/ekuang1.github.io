message: <p>You can never have too much memory ;)<br><br><br><br>Because I tinker with graphics, the extra memory helps. Sometimes, when I'm playing with fractals, memory requirements can get into hundreds of megs per image to compute. It's nice to be able to render and still be able to swap between applications without any disk thrashing.<br><br><br><br>If you can afford the 2G, I'd say go for it. But I'm running 1G and still loving life, so it still might be a bit of overkill.</p>
