message: <p>Forget Separation of Concerns?  Nevah!!!!<br>Well, I had you down for Monday, 10-15, and have been conflicted since I learned Alistair Cockburn will be speaking at an added APLN Seattle meeting that night.  So that problem is solved (and I wonder if the APLN meeting is full yet).<br>Sunday doesn't work, sorry.  Got theatre tix for "Million Dollar Quartet" at the Village Theatre in Issaquah.  You should go.  I saw this in a new-play reading and understand the first full-up theatrical production is awesome.<br>More geek dinners, more often.  That's the ticket ...</p>
