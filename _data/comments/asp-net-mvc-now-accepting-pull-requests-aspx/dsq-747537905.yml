message: <p>@David<br>Oh, I get the pitch, but it's just adding friction that doesn't need to be there.<br>IMHO it's also the exact opposite philosophy as what MVC as a project already did in the past - instead of continuing to 'compete' and reinvent the wheel, they embraced what the community had already done with jQuery even at the 'expense' of Microsoft-Ajax.  It was the better technical decision, and the legion of MVC developers (and more importantly, the users of their sites) benefited from that good technical decision.<br>Now we're looking at CodePlex adding Git support and ostensibly trying to compete with github.<br>As a developer using MVC and as a user of sites using MVC (for instance, StackOverflow), I'm very selfishly interested in making sure that those willing and able to make positive contributions to MVC have the least amount of friction in doing so.<br>Picking CodePlex with its new git support is clearly not the better technical decision *for the project*.  Is it better for CodePlex?  Sure.  Is it potentially better in the long term for github and its users as competition?  Perhaps, but that's an existing space with others competing already (bitbucket, <a href="http://code.google" rel="nofollow noopener" title="code.google">code.google</a>, sourceforge, etc) so it's not like github is completely lacking competition in the first place. :)<br>Phrased differently, if the project had picked github and been announced as up and going on github, it seems reasonable to think that they'd have more and potentially better contributions, at least in the short term.<br>Perhaps I'm wrong and people are so interested in contributing to the project that the added friction won't matter at all, but IMHO open source projects need to focus on dropping the friction for contribution to as low a bar as possible (and acceptable for things like legal teams worried about copyright assignment), and it just doesn't feel like that's what happened here.<br>My $.02 I guess :)</p>
