message: "<p>@James Manning<br>\"i have to admit that using git as your DVCS but *not* using github doesn't make much sense from a technical perspective\"<br>I understand this reaction, but look at it another way: having a project with such an enormous user base using its Git integration will (hopefully) push CodePlex to improve its Git tools and usability, and also (again hopefully) its overall user experience. That would in turn put pressure on Phil and GH to continue improving. Having more players competing at the top is good for everyone.</p>"
