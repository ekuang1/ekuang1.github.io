message: <p>I really like the direction MS is following with this.<br>There are still some rough edges, though. <a href="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/Birdchest/HttpVerbPatch/contribution/2029" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/Birdchest/HttpVerbPatch/contribution/2029">aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/.../2029</a> is a good example of that.<br>While Marcin has good intentions, and he was able to recover with humor from the criticism, the whole Contributor License Agreement thing scores a 10 in the annoying scale.<br>I'm not saying I don't _understand_ the reasons for this; just that it gets in the way of community contributions.<br></p>
