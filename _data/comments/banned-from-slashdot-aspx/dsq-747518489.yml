message: <p>Looks like you've been Haacked! (sorry, couldn't resist)<br>I had this happen a few years ago. Some how, someone hacked our proxy server. I sent an email asking about it and got a snotty response from Commander Taco that the IP in question burned about 10% of his usage that day and that he would never unblock it for that reason. Struck me as arrogant. A few days later the matter resolved itself. Never found out why.</p>
