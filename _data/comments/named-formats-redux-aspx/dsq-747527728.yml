message: <p>Notes:<br>* Only the HanselFormat and OskarFormat work with IDictionary passed as the object.<br>* HanselFormat is nice enough to not throw a format exception if{Title} has no corresponding Title property passed in.  This is different from string.Format, but nice if i want to pass my string through multiple dictionaries / anonymous classes / classes.</p>
