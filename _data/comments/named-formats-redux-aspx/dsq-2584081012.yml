The tokens then get looped over, any tokens that are classified as parameters are handled, and everything is fed directly into a StringBuilder without any intermediate SubString() operations. The tokenizer can also take custom characters for the opening and closing braces (like '&lt;' and '&gt;'), and custom behaviour can be specified for how the parameters are handled.</p><p>It also doesn't rely on DataBinder.Eval(), so it's compliant with .NET Standard/Core. Feedback would be appreciated if anyone wants to give it a spin!</p>"
