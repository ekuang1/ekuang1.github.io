message: <p>Hi @haacked,<br>your idea of git submodule with nuget is very interesting.<br>I faced a similar dilemma but from author perspective.<br>Anyway I think that as you said when the problem is 'small', after all the actual solution can be acceptable.<br>But for larger projects, I'm 100% agree with you!</p>
