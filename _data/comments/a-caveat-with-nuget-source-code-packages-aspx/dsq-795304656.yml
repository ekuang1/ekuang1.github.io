message: <p>Reminds me of the old svn externals days! This is a great idea in principle but I can see a couple of gotchas. If NuGet changes the namespace to match the project, isn't there always going to be an outstanding commit in the local repo? I think package authors would be forced to make a read-only repo url available (admittedly you get this for free on github). Secondly, I know Microsoft are backing git heavily, but I would be sad to see NuGet shun Mercurial.</p>
