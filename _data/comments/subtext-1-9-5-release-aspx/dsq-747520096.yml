message: <p>Hi,<br>This is a good effort for a Web site using asp 3.0.  In the .NET environment can be done much more and especially flexible. I suggest a litle re-design to male of this system more biological and user-friendly. I mean, a better menu, the use of simulated iframes and a more sound association among subjects and articles categories.<br>I know is easy for me to say and difficult to implement the suggested changes; but that is the price to make the difference and provide a better service.</p>
