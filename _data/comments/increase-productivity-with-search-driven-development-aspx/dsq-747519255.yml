message: "<p>Thanks for mentioning <a href=\"http://Krugle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://Krugle.com/\">Krugle</a>! We're doing a lot of cool enterprise focused stuff that's coming RSN. :-)<br>I'm obviously a bit biased but you might want to know <a href=\"http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2007/012907-search.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2007/012907-search.html\">where the term SDD comes from</a>.

Aaron, it's done for you automatically with Krugle (in the related results section). Heheheh.<br>Re: LA vs. Bay Area.  I think \"all of the above\" contributes to the problem. Also, a lot of developers get sucked into big companies (e.g., aerospace) and never get out whereas in the Bay Area the flow of developers around leads to a lot of cross-pollination of people networks. In terms of hiring, the people networks are the biggest factor since that's the dominant way to get the best people.<br>Re: Berkeley vs. The Big O. Well, at least they are on the right side of the bay. And Zachary's on College Ave. is the perfection of yummy, harmonious goodness.</p>"
