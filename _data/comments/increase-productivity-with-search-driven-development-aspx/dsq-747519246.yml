message: <p>&gt;we wondered why L.A. doesnâ€™t have <br>&gt;anywhere close to the tech industry <br>&gt;that the Bay Area does<br>Because the Bay Area totally rocks and LA is totally lame, of course. :P<br>I say forget FizzBuzz, every job interview should have a search effectiveness test. Rather than "how do you code a quicksort", it could be "how long does it take you to Google a good quicksort algorithm". And if you want to make it tricky, add something like "in Eiffel".<br></p>
