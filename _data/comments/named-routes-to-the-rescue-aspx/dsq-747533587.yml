message: <p>Great advice. I find the route matching process a bit confusing at times. With named routing I no longer need to understand the route matching process, which I think is a good thing. ;) <br>Why not deprecate route matching in future versions of ASP.NET and show a warning when leaving out the route name (or make the route name a required parameter)?</p>
