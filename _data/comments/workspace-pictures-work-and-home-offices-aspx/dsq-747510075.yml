message: <p>Classic!  I have the same desk.  However I have two of them in my office.  I need to space for my Mac and my PCs.  I did however by the Network stand from IKEA and it works great .  I have my two servers at the bottom, my two printers on the next two shelves and then my router and switch at the top.  Saves a ton space.  I'll have to put a picutre of my office on my blog soon!<br><br></p>
