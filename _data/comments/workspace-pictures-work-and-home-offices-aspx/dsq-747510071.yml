message: <p>Ah yes.  I've now added your workspace to the list.<br><br><br><br>That, my friend, is a bonafide Goldtouch (<a href="http://Goldtouch.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Goldtouch.com">Goldtouch.com</a>) keyboard.  It has a lever on top that allows you to manipulate the two sides (joined at the top middle) of the keyboard.  I like it opened slightly outward and having the middle slightly higher than the sides. I used to have it like an inverted V.</p>
