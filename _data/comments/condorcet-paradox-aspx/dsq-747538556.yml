message: <p>Interestingly, this is actually the situation we had in the last election in the UK. Conservatives got the most votes, but didn't get the majority (&gt;50%), which meant we had a hung parliament (I was disappointed to find that the term wasn't literal).<br>They had the option of forming a minority government, but the general consensus amongst the press at the time was that this wouldn't be viable. What they actually did was form a coalition government with the 3rd-running party, the Liberal Democrats, which is hilarious because they both come from the opposite ends of the political spectrum (Conservatives are moderate right, while LibDems are far left). The two parties combined had the majority.<br>The tragic thing is that, as much of a mess as this coalition is, it's still better than Labour.</p>
