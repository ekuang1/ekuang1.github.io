message: <p>Don't know where this fits into your scenarios, but Australia uses the "Two party preferred" solution.  It requires that all candidates are ranked from 1 to x.<br>If there is no clear majority ( over 50% ), then the candidate with the lowest votes is eliminated.  Each vote for that candidate is individually re-assigned to next ranked candidate.<br>The process repeats until 1 candidate gains over 50% of the votes.<br>It means that it is possible for a candidate to get most most number of votes in the first "round" but lose the final count.<br>In your second example with 7 voters/3 candidates, if the 4 votes not for Hanselman both ranked Hanselman 3rd, he would not be elected.<br>Yes I realise that it is a tie for the first round loser but expand the example with 9 votes  -&gt; 4 hanselman, 3 Haack - 2 Guthrie.  Using the Aussie system, Haack would be the successful candidate if both Guthrie's voters ranked Haack second.<br>If gets much more complicated when more than 1 candidate can be elected.<br>See <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/index.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/index.htm">http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/index.htm</a>, if you have a pathological need to find more information!! <br></p>
