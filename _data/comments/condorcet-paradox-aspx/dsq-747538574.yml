message: <p>It's a little late, but just two quick comments:<br>1. Dictatorship criterion in Arrow's theorem really is a misnomer, because a person is not really a dictator if there is no intent of his to be. What happens here is that it's not known in advance who will be a "dictator" in a particular vote (it is determined by relative preferences); calling that a dictatorship is just silly. It really seems like a more subtle version of (also a ridiculous argument) calling democracy "dictatorship of the majority".<br>2. There are voting systems, such as my favorite Range voting, to which the Arrow theorem does not apply, since they don't just use ordering of preferences, but also their weights. And it is a very simple, obvious system, which has also many other good properties (mostly stemming from the fact that it doesn't throw away any information provided by voters).</p>
