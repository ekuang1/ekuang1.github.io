message: "<p>Aha, excellent. Voting systems are so much fun! Our current system is abysmally wrongerest of course, but one should also ask the question of why we are voting. Usually, it's to achieve some sort of representation. Once in office, the candidate is supposed to represent the people who voted. What the article is neglecting to consider in this perspective is whether the set of candidates being voted for does actually achieve representation. They usually don't, as the reason for becoming a candidate already selects you for certain unrepresentative qualities (in the US, that's wealth apparently).<br>Here's the thing: the only system (that I know of) that does achieve representation was the one used in ancient Greek democracy: chance. Just do away with elections and pick people at random instead.
