message: <p>I'd like to see the workings of Arrow's theorem as the great Charles Dodgson spent a great deal of time working on Elections - particularly on voting in situations with more than two candidates and more than two outcomes. He was able to work around cyclical voting conditions in almost all cases (perhaps even all? Can't remember)<br>He never got around to publishing his work, but a great deal of it is still available. I mourn when I think of what the modern political landscape would be now if he had completed and published his work.</p>
