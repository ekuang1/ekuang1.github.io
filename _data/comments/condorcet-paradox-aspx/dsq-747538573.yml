message: <p>William Poundstone wrote a book (Gaming the Vote) about this several years back. It presented a history of voting mechanisms and provided arguments in favor of range voting. It's not as though computer scientists and economists aren't actively studying this. Be careful not to interpret Arrow's theorem as an argument against democracy relative to markets.<br></p>
