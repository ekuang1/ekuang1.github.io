message: <p>If only we had a perfect electoral system that would keep all the "crazy libertarians" out of politics--you know, one that makes it impossible for an independent third party to win! Oh wait, that's the system we have. <br>Why don't you work out the math for voting your conscience instead of voting for Tweedledum or Tweedledee? The conscience loses every time.</p>
