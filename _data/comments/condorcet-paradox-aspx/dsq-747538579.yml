message: <p>I'm not sure you do in fact have a 'two party system'. If your system is anything like ours in the UK, anyone is free to stand in elections and in fact we regularly have 6 or more parties standing. Nevertheless, two 'main parties' dominate.<br>I wonder if two-party domination is itself a side-effect of first-past-the-post voting?</p>
