message: <p>You're assuming that public education is good for us. It's not, no more kids have access to education than they did immediately before public education became law and no matter how much money you throw into public education the result is diminishing. Not diminishing returns on that investment, because there has been absolutely no return on increased investment in public education.  Diminishing as in every year that goes by, public education gets worse compared to private and privately funded education.<br>You're also assuming that democracy is desirable. It's not. It results in the rule of the mob. In the US it results in the candidate that gets 30% of the eligible voter's vote. That's right, only ~30% voted for Obama, even less for Romney. There there is no way that you can call that an endorsement by the majority, and even if you do, then all you're doing is enslaving the minority to the will of the majority for 4 years.<br>Further democracy's greatest flaw is that as soon as the people recognize that they can vote themselves free stuff, the democracy will collapse. That's exactly what is happening in Europe and indeed in the US. <br>As soon as any government system accepts that government is not subject to the same laws of theft and slavery as individuals, all governments become evil, and all governments seal their own ending.<br>The desirable governmental system is one of local governance based on base principles of criminal law and NOTHING else. It is only a loose affiliation for protection against foreign aggression and the enforcement of non-aggression (against person or property) by everyone including government that results in a positive system that is sustainable. To do so requires that the government must stay small and strictly limited because only the small and limited government is directly controllable by the people either through force or by walking down the road to a different community.<br>Thus I say that yes, the math is bogus and results in an insular government that doesn't actually answer to the people AND the entire concept of voting is a sham that makes is no more free than no true government.</p>
