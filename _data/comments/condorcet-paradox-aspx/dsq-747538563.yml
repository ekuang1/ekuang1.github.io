message: <p>Brian Dunning did <a href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4281" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4281">an episode</a> of his (excellent) Skeptoid podcast on the science of voting last year. He covers a lot of the same ground, but it is a good listen in any case.<br><br></p>
