message: <p>1) It is funny<br>2) Durex started out as an UK brand<br>3) Durex is the world market leader <br>4) Not all things are American<br>5) If you have problems using a Durex then you shouldn't be having sex because we sure don't need your stupid genes.<br>Funniest line in the comments must be by Sky who complains that Durex condoms are no good because amoung other things they are tight. Sheesh, what did he expect.. that it would be loose?</p>
