message: <p>Well, I find the funniest part about this is the number of posts on the whole thing. That, and that I read each and every one of the posts. AND now i'm added to that by posting. lol. <br>Oh, and btw, I didn't use Durex or ANY of the competitors product... My baby is due on Feb 14 '08! Great date for it, huh?</p>
