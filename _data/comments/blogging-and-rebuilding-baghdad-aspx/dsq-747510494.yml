message: <p>C-130s are meant to carry both passengers and cargo. I was first a passenger in one in 1978 as a paratrooper. As to the allegedly horrific corkscrews we always hear about, I've flown twice into BIAP on C-130s and the landing was as gentle as any landing I've ever made. I assume the plane was looping but to be honest I couldn't even tell that. And a "plunge"? Give me a break. This is just false bravado BS.</p>
