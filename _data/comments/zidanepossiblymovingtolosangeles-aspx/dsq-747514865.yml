message: "<p>Don't know about Bebeto, since he retired I've lost his tracks. Romario has not retired, though. He still plays with the Vasco da Gama. That man is <b>amazing</b>: on 2005 season he had a special arrangement with the club, which includes the right to decide when to train with the rest of the team, the right to play only local games, and the right to go to discos and enjo9y the night life as he sees fit. And he's older than forty. With all of that going on, he was the 2005 top scorer of Brasil's league, with 22 goals. Now he's <i>retired</i>, but he has signed to play 5 months with Miami's team on MFL, with an agreement to come back to Vasco once the american league is over.<br>And no, I don't like <i>f√∫tbol</i> very much. But I'm a Spaniard: here you practically have to breathe the damn stuff. I'm a Barcelona supporter, by the way. <br>And don't get me started with the damned soccer/football issue: how can you call a game <i>foot</i>ball when they only touch the ball with their feet every once in a while? <br>Funny enough, I prefer your football to our soccer: I think it's a more beautiful, strategic and intelligent  sport. But that's me, almost all my friends say that I shoulda been born american.</p>"
