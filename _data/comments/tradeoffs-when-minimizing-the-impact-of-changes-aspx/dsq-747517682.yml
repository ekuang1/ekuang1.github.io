message: "<p>A few more thoughts here re: Dynamic Query Engine. If you use Stored Procs for your data access there's a good chance you're tying yourself to a specific backend anyway, so switching between backends immediately becomes much more difficult because at the very least you'll have to migrate each of the stored procs. However beyond that - with proper abstraction the DAL should be able to negotiate the stored proc calls from business layer in such a way that there are no code changes from the application...<br>So yes in what you refer to - I use a dynamic query engine for that flexibility (and the fact that I hate writing TSQL code &lt;s&gt;), although there are certainly stored procs in my applications where they are truly required for complex multi-query operations. <br><br>Some of that pain can be eleviated though with Code Generation/Templates. Things like nHibernate have templates that can be used to generate the appropriate stored procedure abstractions for different backends I believe.<br>But like I said it all depends on whether different backends really matter. I doubt that it makes sense running SubText on Oracle or MySql although I'm sure you'd have a few takers.<br></p>"
