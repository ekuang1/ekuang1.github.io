message: <p>I believe Rick is saying that if you make a change to the database schema and have to change code in the database provider for each database your application supports, then your database provider is operating too high in the application stack.<br>Ideally, you should only have to change the dynamic query or stored procedure once in the application and then each database provider will appropriately handle the call to its database using the proper change.<br>I believe the DAL in .TEXT (SubText) is operating perhaps a bit high in the stack and would require code/sql changes for each database when a schema change occurs.<br>If using dynamic SQL hardcoded in the DAL, you also have to change all the queries to compensate for the additional column / schema change. With solutions like SubSonic or NHibernate, you don't have to make as many or any changes because the schema is grabbed in real-time or read from a mapping file. I think that is where Phil is coming from.<br>I prefer the real-time schema discovery or mapping files as well in situations where you can expect an evolving / volatile schema. Saves you from an avalanche of changes in many cases.</p>
