message: <p>Hell yes! I generally manage to do 40-45 hours per week. I have found if it's not too frequent I can maintain productivity while working late hours if I have to, but, as my co-workers can testify, I have a rather sour disposition the day after.<br><br><br><br>I've always felt that there is just way more to life than the office. Ultimately what's the point? Slave at 70 hours/week for what? A happy boss and a gold watch at retirement? No thanks.</p>
