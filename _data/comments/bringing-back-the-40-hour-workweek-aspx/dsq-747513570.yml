message: <p>Jeff:<br><br>I agree to a degree (who new i was a poet?).  But say I find going to the stripper to be fun (for the sake of argument).  Wouldn't 14hrs a day be excessive, especially given I'm happily married?  I suppose if my wife was OK with it, and I had nothing else just as fun to do, it might well be.  But I think I would benefit from having other interests.<br><br><br><br>In my case, I have enough energy and love coding to do more than 40hrs a week, but I find it more fulfilling to diversify and give some of that energy to open source and personal projects.  But I also understand and agree that "balance" is not the same across the board and that what I feel does not apply to everyone.<br><br><br><br>Scott:<br><br><br><br>What kind of watch are we talking about here?</p>
