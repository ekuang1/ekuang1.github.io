message: <p>Wow... I can't remember the last time I worked _only_ 40 hrs in a week. As a matter of fact, I'm just coming off quite a bender of a week right now. I was on Holiday/Vacation on Mon./Tue., and yet I still managed to book more than 40 hrs between Wed and Fri. Man, deadlines SUCK!<br><br><br><br>I can't believe that I'm still up writing this comment to be honest... but at least I can enjoy a nice Miller Lite while I do it:) Perhaps more drinking in the workplace would help boost productivity! Err, wait... on second thought I suppose it would only increase the number of "what the F- was I thinking when I wrote that?" moments.</p>
