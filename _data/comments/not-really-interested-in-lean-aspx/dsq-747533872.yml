message: <p>I really like the idea of shared ownership of the "big P" product, not just delivery of individual features.  The pair-testing approach should foster a better understanding on all sides.<br>I'd be interested in knowing whether you fix bugs as you find them during pair-test or take notes, address, then restart the pair-testing cycle?</p>
