message: <p>At our company we evolved our development process down the same road during the course of the last few years and I must say that the last two projects are going rather well.<br>You might want to google Definition Of Done ("DOD"). I was sceptic at first, but it has proven very useful and I changed my opinion.<br>A demo every sprint (we have sprints of about 3 weeks, depending on the project) for our stakeholders has also proven positive. It increased interest in our project development, gave our stakeholders an idea of the scale of the project and has created useful feedback sooner in the project cycle.<br>We also do (almost) everything in pair, from creating sprint items, to devving and testing (QA)</p>
