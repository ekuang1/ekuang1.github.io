message: "<p>It's going to hurt at first.  It will feel like your velocity fell through the floor and people will be frustrated with the feature \"completion\" rate.  I quote that, because a buggy feature isn't complete for the person experiencing the bug or the person who's feature isn't being developed while buggy feature is being triaged and fixed.<br>In the end having automated regression tests is the key to raising and maintaining your velocity over time.  Nuget is lacking that in many areas, especially around the packages themselves.<br>My #1 recommendation on this particular project would be to optimize the mechanism test packages.
