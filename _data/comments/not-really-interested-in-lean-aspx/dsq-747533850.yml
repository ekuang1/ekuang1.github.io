message: <p>I sure hope you're willing to pair &amp; TDD too.  If so than lean will be freaking awesome for you guys.<br>Lean as a principle really helps, and I was about to fly off the handle when I read your title, but glad I read on without being too hot headed.  ;)<br>I wish you the best in moving forward with NuGet.  I imagine I'll be using it a bit in the coming year!  Hats off and have fun!</p>
