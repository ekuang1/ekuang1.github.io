message: <p>@Emmanuel you can always use skype to share the desktop while testing or if (as you should) have well documented steps to reproduce the bug or a well defined scenario for a feature, do peer testing. You test the features of somebody else, and somebody else test your features. the task is not completed until someone test the feature.<br>In a community this would also help to speed up the development cycle of the top priority features/bugs</p>
