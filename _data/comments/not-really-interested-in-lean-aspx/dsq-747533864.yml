message: "<p>@John: We tried sitting with our end user from time to time and watch how they used our application. Although it didn't bring us the revelation we had hoped for, it did show us some new views on how our application would be used so we could tune our testing focusses differently.<br>Go sit next to your user and ask them to do their day-to day job whilst talking out loud about what they are doing. The issue we had was it felt awkward and users would behave somewhat unnatural. We haven't found a way to improve the process yet, but it did help us some</p>"
