message: <p>Ya know, I have long struggled with this problem as everyone else has at some point. I worked at quite a few companies where battling spammers and trying to keep one step ahead of them was a daily occurence.<br>There are several good ways to combat bots, but IMO the best way (although maybe a little overkill), would be to generate an image for the users email address. Some people may say, "Well the spammers will just make bots that decipher the characters out of the image", and this is true. The thing is, how much time will they REALLY spend doing this when they can just go somewhere else and harvest text off a page instead?<br>It's really an endless battle. We patch a hole, they find another; we get a bigger gun, they get a bazooka =)<br>On a side note, with how well spam filters are improving (like gmail's), I don't even get that much spam anymore. Maybe about 1-2 in my inbox everyday. In addition, if spam bothers you that much, it's nothing a baseball bat and a plane ticket won't fix =)</p>
