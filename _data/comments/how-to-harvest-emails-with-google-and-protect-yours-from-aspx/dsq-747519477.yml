message: "<p>&gt; This would be bandwidth heavy and computationally heavy, I imagine.<br>If you're using a botnet to send spam, you'll be using it to harvest emails.<br>Besides, the HTML alone isn't that bandwidth heavy.<br>My advice : suck it up. If you want pewople to contact you, make it as easy as possible and deal with the resulting spam yourself.<br>No javascript tricks, fucking web forms with captchas and all that bollocks.<br>Use a dedicated obscure public address w99@domain and you'll cope.<br>When I arrived at my current company, they were getting 500 spams a day on their account. I got them to pay $40 to their ISP for spam protection. That reduced it to 10 a day. They are easily filtered out with a couple of scripts so now we get 2 a week through those filters.<br></p>"
