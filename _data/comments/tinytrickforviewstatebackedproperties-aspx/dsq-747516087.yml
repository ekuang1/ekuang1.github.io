message: <p>Just an FYI... <br>The terms <i>trinary</i> and <i>ternary</i> are apparently interchangeable in this context. I had no idea, which is why I had to look up what a trinary operator was. <br>The Wikipedia definition for the ternary operator can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:">here</a>.</p>
