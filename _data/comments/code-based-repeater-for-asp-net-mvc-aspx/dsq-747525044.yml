message: <p>Phil - My biggest pain point is that in many ways the MVC framework seems to be a huge step backward.  One of the greatest advances that I have seen in software development over the last 20 years has been the realization of some of the benefits of code re-use.  More specifically, software components and the binary packaging which allows for them to be easily distributed and re-used has resulted in a huge productivity boosts for the development community.  This is definitely the case in the desktop world, and to a large degree, it has been that way in the Asp.Net world as well.<br>In many ways this feels like the old debate between the VB and C++ crowds...  C++ Guy - Look how much control we have over all aspects of our software. We can build anything we want to.  VB Guy - Yeah but look at how many real world business problems we have solved while you are still trying to build one simple dialog box.<br></p>
