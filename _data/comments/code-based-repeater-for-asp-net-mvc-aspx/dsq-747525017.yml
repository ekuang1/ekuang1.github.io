message: <p>I like the jQuery examples simply because they don't involve the hideous spaghetti code that is quickly becoming the distinguishing feature of all the MVC examples I am seeing, and is touted as a good thing to boot. Its not. Whatever its shortcomings, ASP.NET gave us a way to code cleanly (compared to classic ASP, for example), so lets not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
