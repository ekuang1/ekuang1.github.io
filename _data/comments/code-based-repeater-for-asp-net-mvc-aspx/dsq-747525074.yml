message: <p>I may be on the wrong foot here...But i like JQuery. <br>I would let my jquery take care of the UI issues compared to the server side processing to certain extent.<br>For template engine - JQuery "Superfly DOM"<br>Styling - simple few lines would give much control over the display alternative items, grouping etc with Jquery and CSS.<br>What ever makes my job easier to develop and maintain (and things in between)!</p>
