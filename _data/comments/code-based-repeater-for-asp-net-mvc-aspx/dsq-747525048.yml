message: <p>While I do like the control afforded by the demo, I have to agree with Joe. The comments to this post demonstrate the point that we are spending too much time worrying about more than one way of doing things. <br>In Python, the community really tries to just have one way to do something. In Rails, DHH tells everyone to make their own framework if they want to do it more than one way. <em>We</em> seem to have 20 ways just to do rendering. Ever heard of the anti-pattern, "Design by committee?"<br>At the same time, I'm struggling to get ASP.Net to do what I want because there is so much stuff missing or badly designed. I fail to see why we don't learn by experience and have great hackers like you guys spend time getting that right.<br>How can we expect anyone to take this up anyway? You guys might be hacks, but I am still trying to train normal developers how to use generics. Lambdas are <em>way</em> beyond them at the moment. And now we're asking them to start learning JQuery, just to do something which they could previously do using a DataGrid?<br>In any case, the Rails way is <em>way</em> simpler. They have a class just for cycling through CSS names on each iteration. What about trying something similar to that?</p>
