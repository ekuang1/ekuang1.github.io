message: <p>@Joe because every problem in computer science and software engineering has been solved, so no point in trying to experiment with different ways of doing anything, right? ;)<br>It's a matter of choice and preference. It's why you guys (DNN) stuck with VB, while many devs stuck with C#. We have 30 different languages to solve things, but that's a <em>good</em> thing, right?</p>
