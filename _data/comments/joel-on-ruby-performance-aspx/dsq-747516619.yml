message: "<p>I love all the conversations going on right now around Ruby performance and Spolsky's rants about it.<br>I personally don't use Ruby, not because it's slow or anything like that, but because there isn't much demand for it yet.<br>I think the \"bumper-sticker slogan\" comment is just stupid.  One of the programmers that I learned under got me so wrapped around performance issues that I still find myself burning a bunch of time trying to figure out how to write code in the most optimal way.<br>Truth be told, it's very rarely an issue, and when it is it's very easy to go back and refactor just the code that is necessary.<br>Bottom line:  It's always cheaper to throw money at faster hardware than it is to spend on developer hours.</p>"
