message: "<p>Wow, you Ruby people are seriously uptight.  I know it's hard to imagine, but it's is POSSIBLE that Ruby has flaws.  It is, in fact, one of the slowest languages in existence, for example.  (True fact.  If you don't believe me, then look at the language shoot-out data yourself: <a href=\"http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/)\">http://shootout.alioth.debi...</a><br>Before you guys get your panties in a bundle, you should remember that when Java was the new kid on the block that people ragged on it relentlessly regarding its slow performance.  The performance of Java has improved tremendously since those days.  Java is now a very fast language and can compete with the likes of C and C++ on most benchmarks.<br>If Ruby fanatics want to be taken seriously, you better start fully embracing the flaws of the language otherwise nobody is going to believe anything you say.  Every article I read these days on Ruby or Rails makes me seriously question everything that's said because I know Rubyists always gloss over anything that can possibly be construed as negative.<br></p>"
