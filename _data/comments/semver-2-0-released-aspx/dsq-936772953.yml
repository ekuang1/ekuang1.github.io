message: <p>dominictarr As far as the contents of the SemVer string itself, and the ordering of versions, sure.  It is a spec.</p><p>But as far as the "semantic" part, it's got a lot of fuzzy parts.  Semantics come from humans.  What constitutes a "breaking" change, really?  Is it a "bugfix" to add a feature that was mistakenly removed, or is that "new functionality"?  What if you bump the allowed version of a dependency, and this breaks someone's program that was diving into your library's guts?  What about marked "private" APIs that are nonetheless exposed, and may change and cause disruption?  Then there are other meaning that sometimes is communicated via version numbers, like Node's "even = stable, odd = unstable" semantics.</p><p>None of this is (or should be) in the specification.  The spec, like a dictionary, tells you "If you see this specific term, here's a good guess at what the author is trying to tell you", and authors that deviate too far from the norms in the language community are deviants.  But deviants, and people using things "wrong" often make permanent change in language communities!  Just look at phrases like "begs the question", which have radically changed from their original meaning.</p>
