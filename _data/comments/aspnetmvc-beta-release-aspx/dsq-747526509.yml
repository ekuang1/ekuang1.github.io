message: <p>Thanks for including the futures assembly.<br>Good job on the release, I noticed you guys did a great job of adding new features without necessarily destroying the 'old' way of doing - ie. I like the 2 methods of using the Form helper.<br>I prefer wrapping it with using, but to see both options is nice.<br>Any chance of including a CheckBoxList in the futures?</p>
