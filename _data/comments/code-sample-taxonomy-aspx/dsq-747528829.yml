message: <p>The problem with the "we'll fix it after it ships" mentality is that it is not real world for most sample apps.  Almost every sample app in existence has 0 maintenance dollars allocated to it.  It is created, distributed and then abandoned.<br>That is not to say I agree at all with the sentiment that all code out of MS must be reference code.  That line of thinking is ridiculous.  The devs at MS are good, but they are not gods.  They don't have all the answers anymore than the rest of CS community.  They are learning and improving their craft just as the rest of us are.  <br>As a society we have a tendency to put people up on pedestals.  Often this is done so everyone has a better target at which to throw tomatoes.  The furor over Oxite and Kobe just seems to follow right in line with this mentality.</p>
