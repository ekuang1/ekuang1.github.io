message: <p>I haven't seen the new sample app, but I am sure many are just resonating what a few say. <br>After all, how many out there really master most of these things? not only that, how much time have happened after they really learned it?<br>I personally think we are reaching a point where a lot of stuff is maturing, but expecting every team/person to make the change right away is unrealistic. <br>Actually, I have seen many explanations of these approaches that are flawed, revealing the writer doesn't have full understanding of all the factors involved on the value we get from some of these. If we don't keep reading and learning, there wouldn't be much info to move forward.<br>We need to move on, change will take time. Some will move faster than others, but we need to remember there is no "upgrade all developers" button.</p>
