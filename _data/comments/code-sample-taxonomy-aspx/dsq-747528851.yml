message: <p>If people at Microsoft don't know DRY or IoC maybe they shouldn't be allowed to lead the development of a customer/developer facing application? Whoever authorized the Kobe team to release source code probably should have had a better idea about the level of expertise the developers had in the area.<br>I tweeted this earlier, and I think part of the problem is that you can't easily hire good developers to build sample applications. I equate good development with passion, and most passionate developers I know want to do more than what amounts to glorified documentation.<br>The other problem is that Microsoft excels at building compilers/operating systems/file systems/frameworks but not the type of Application the vast majority of its developers build. I took a couple compilers course, it was neat. The  people who were really good at it were geniuses. They were easily twice as smart as I was. But I talk to them now, and they've _never_ heard DI or SRP. They'd be just as lost doing what I do as I would doing what they do. I don't know much about medicine, but I'm going to guess that its like a brain surgeon swapping places with a heart surgeon. <br>Paul Vick, Scott Gu, Anders - I wish I could be as smart and skilled as them. But I'm also really thankful they don't spend weekends writing banking software that I'm going to have to maintain.<br>My solution is for Microsoft to put a real team of enterprise developers together - get Ayende, Chad &amp; Jeremy, Scott Reynolds and Scott Allen - and have them build REAL systems. Make them a part of a skunk works program. They come up with a real web 2.0 idea(yes, that means you need to come up with something better than another blog engine), and release the code open source. Microsoft is in the unique position of being able to release real applications/services &amp; leverage that source code as documentation for its developers. Imagine if Twitter, Facebook or Digg had been built by such a team. That's honestly my dream. (stackoverflow comes to mind as a potential candidate too).<br>It might be an expensive team to put together, but you'll get a a real property and some real guidance. <br>(P.S. - My idea was My Property. By Reading The Above Paragraphs, Microsoft Owes me $100 000USD - Make Certified Check Payable to Karl Seguin. Due May 1st, 5% monthly interest thereafter).</p>
