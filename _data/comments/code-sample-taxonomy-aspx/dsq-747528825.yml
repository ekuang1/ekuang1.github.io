message: "<p>My feeling is that MVC architecture aims to improve code quality for Web apps, it has pushed to improve my architecture/developer/testing skills.  Creating one sample MVC app that gets the balance right between flexibility and quality is a tough task.<br>I think the MVC community would appreciate a simple Reference Code sample for a simple ASP.Net app.  It would accelerate the adoption of ASP.Net MVC into the WebForms developer community.    For example, I got hooked on ASP.Net MVC because of Rob Conway's MVC Storefront videos.  As a sample, the Storefront is great, but it's a lot of code for a novice digest. <br>So, this is what I'd like to see: a simple real world(ish) example that keeps as close to the .Net 3.5 Sp1 as possible (perhaps giving URLs to point people to alternatives outside Sp1).  The sample illustrates the design patterns you'd choose in the different layers (without too much overkill on patterns, it has to be digestible to novices).  <br>If there is a project that already is \"Reference Code\", please let me know.  If not can someone create a simple example of one so we can learn from the Ninjas!  I'd create one, but I fear my code quality would not be up to the mark!<br><br></p>"
