message: <p>Before I get to the meat of the discussion, the problems with Kobe aren't MVC specific. You could take out the entire UI element and all of the problems persist. I'm afraid that our criticism has focused on this being an MVC sample, despite the problems being non-MVC related. In other words, the fact that the team didn't intend for this to be taken as an MVC reference, doesn't really explain why their domain and data layers suck, why they didn't write unit tests, or why they couldn't agree on reasonable coding styles from the get-go.<br>About the process...I fully endorse Microsoft's willingness to try and learn. I'd be pretty hypocritical if I didn't, because you don't have to go too far back into my code to find similar crap. You do think the Oxite situation would have made people @ MS (yourself including) far more sensitive/aware.<br>A big issue for me with Oxite, and to a lesser extent Kobe (maybe because Oxite corrected my expectations), is for Microsoft to actually PULL these downloads. Extreme arrogance I know right? But I figured that my outrage would be enough to get the download links pulled and an message explaining why posted. I don't enjoy publicly lashing out (its tiring), and I sincerely feel sorry for how I handled Oxite - I'm a pretty passionate programmer, and I *know* *I* would have taken it quite personally had someone done that to my code. Nonetheless, I feel equally sincere that these examples can really SCREW over individuals and companies. I actually worry about some poor programmer somewhere, who might be a little junior, not the best in the world, and going down the Oxite/Kobe road. I know these kinds of programmers, and I think they make up a large portion of the .NET ecosystem. They lack confidence, or experience, or something, but they are unable to critically think for themselves or question Microsoft. So that's my angle, and that's what I think Microsoft can reasonably do to make all of this a better process.<br>It'd be great if things could be more proactive. But I understand that there are 80K employees, under different teams, of various skills, and with different goals. Under those circumstances at least be more reactive. We've raised the flag. I'm hoping that some decision makers at Microsoft have now taken the time to more thoroughly review Kobe. If those people agree with us, PULL the download and put up a warning about why. I see every minute that goes by, ever download that happens, as having the potential for a small disaster. I still can't understand why Oxite wasn't pulled. I'm pretty sure it's cultural - it would mean having to admit you (Microsoft) was wrong.<br>You want the freedom to learn and improve, but in the months it takes to fix it, you're willing to let thousands of people learn from the initial disaster. That's just irresponsible and shortsighted.<br>2nd comment coming up..<br></p>
