message: <p>Kyle:<br>I should have been more clear. These guys should be hired as blue badge. I consider this an extremely important hole that should be filled, and hiring a team of 4-6 guys to work FULL TIME on software they are passionate about is the only solution I see.<br>The code review idea is good, but I see time problems with that as well. A lot of us wouldn't review code pre-release for lack of time. I know that's a little unfair - we won't review your code BEFORE you release, but we'll bitch about it really loudly AFTER you release, but that's the reality.</p>
