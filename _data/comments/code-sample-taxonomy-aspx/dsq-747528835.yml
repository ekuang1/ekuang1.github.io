message: <p>I don't expect a full blown architecture example to see how to 'create an ActionLink' in <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc.<br>If people are going to copy and paste some sample into their code without thinking about what it does, that is on them, not on you.<br>If you are creating an application as a 'best practices in mvc' as a sample, then sure, you should apply all the best practices. <br>But a simple example like what you posted in your last topic... no way, I don't want all that - something simple that the developer should see the pattern and build it how they need to in their architecture.<br>So, in summary - I don't want some full blown best practices sample project to see 'how to create a grid in jquery'.  If I'm looking for a best practices application, maybe I'd do what Billy McCafferty did with Sharp Architecture - with the entire concept being 'here are good practice to use when building a <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc app'.  <br>I wouldn't want to download and install all that just to see a 'how to create a grid in jquery' - please no!</p>
