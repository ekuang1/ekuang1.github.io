message: <p>I recently started answering questions from the community on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>, and I briefly came up against the same issues when posting code samples. I strongly feel that if you are trying to demonstrate a particular concept with demo code that it is a good idea not to detract from the concepts you are trying to put across with extraneous infrastructure code and 'good practice'. Anytime someone tries to include these extra elements in simple code samples they are:<br>1) Diverting attention from the pertinent bits of the API they are trying to demonstrate.<br>2) Making assumptions about the readers context / situation - where the code is being used, how it will be run, etc.<br>3) Wasting their own time<br>4) Wasting the readers time<br>5) Opening themselves up to comments on the bits of the code that are NOT pertinent to the api under discussion<br>6) Missing things out - you can't put ALL the best practise you know into a 10 line code sample, so don't try. It's just a sample :)<br>In the end, some people will find the few lines of code they want, and copy / paste it without another thought, whether it's surrounded by reams of 'best-practise' code or not. Of course, for someone in your situation working for Microsft, it's not quite that simple. Maybe the best idea is to include a short standard disclaimer on every sample (or a link to a disclaimer), then you can forget about it and concentrate on demonstrating the particular apis in question to the best of your ability.</p>
