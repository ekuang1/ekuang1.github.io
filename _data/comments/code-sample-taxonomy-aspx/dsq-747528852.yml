message: <p>Here's a thought, and it may not be a good one. I'm just thinking off the top of my keyboard here. What if the sample apps that MS is intending to put out had an anonymous mailing list where they'd post code samples of portions of the samples long before the samples go to the web? These lists would be open to anyone to respond to - but it's an opt-in scenario, obviously, and all email addresses are anonymous, except obviously for security checking and such.<br>Each sample wouldn't have to send out a lot of examples of the code - if they can get down a style that most people on the lists like for a specific piece of code, then they can use that as an example of how to code the other parts.<br>I'd like to think of this as almost an anonymous code-review system. There would be problems with this approach, of course. You'd run into issues with people getting into arguments over the code (very likely), with dry-spells where other people are just too busy (less likely, given that anyone can sign up), with still having the possibility of shoddy code slipping in due to the reviewers' suggestions not being what the general audience is looking for, and so on.<br>This would go out earlier than even the Codeplex project - not sure how you'd manage that, though. Hm, maybe you could put the initial project onto Codeplex, but not officially "released". People would sign up for said list there. Over time, as things are ready to go up on Codeplex, they're sent to the list for review. Once the "OK" comes back, they're posted. Development would be slower, since you have to deal with feedback, but presumably the quality would sky-rocket.<br>Good, bad? Any thoughts?</p>
