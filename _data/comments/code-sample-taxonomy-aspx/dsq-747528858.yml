message: <p>@Karl, yeah, there's no way they'd go work for MS. I seriously think that no amount of money would get them to do that, although I could be horribly mistaken.<br>And yeah, I pointed out the thing you did in my comment - people just not having time to review things, though I see why yours is different (they wouldn't even sign up for the service, let alone actually contribute). There could be an incentive program there, though - whether it be a contributor's badge or something, or even money. Giving out a small amount of money (say $50 per good contribution, as determined by the team) for a list of 10 reviewers giving one review a week would be $500 per week. That's really not that much, but would provide a pretty big incentive for some people, I think. I know that, even with my well-paid consulting position, if I were to get a book at the end of a project that I helped review, that would make me really happy and encourage me to help that much more.</p>
