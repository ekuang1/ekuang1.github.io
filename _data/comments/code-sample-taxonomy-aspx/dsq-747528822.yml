message: <p>There will always be "gimme teh codez" copy-pasters.<br>No matter how good your code is, it is most likely not the perfect solution to every situation and some healthy common sence is needed to evaluate how copy-pastable (a section) of code is.<br>Sometimes it is possible to demonstrate good code practices by referencing to stub procedures/classes. You don't write a letter of extra code, but because of a descriptive procedure name everybody gets what it should do.<br>This off course renders you with unrunnable code, but that often times isn't necessary to demonstrate someting.<br>I personally don't believe in a one-size-fits all answer to your question and no matter what your decision is, being a front man of a great project and being from a large corp will always send some piss your way. Don't let that hamper what you're doing, it has helped me (and no doubt plenty of others) a great deal. Appreciated (piss-free ;)</p>
