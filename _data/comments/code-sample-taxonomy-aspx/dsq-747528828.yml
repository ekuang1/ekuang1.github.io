message: <p>I learn though example, so samples are pretty useful to me.<br>I think a sample should:<br>1) Compile and run - its pretty useless if it doesn't.<br>2) Be Compelling - i.e. do something I actually want to do - not something contrived to illustrate a command.  Compare Kernighan and Ritchie "C" - excellent sample code, with Stroustrup "C++" - rubbish samples showing nothing (and they don't even compile.)<br>3) Show best practice.  How much in production C# have you seen where a file handle is just closed, rather than having the whole thing wrapped in a using()?  The thing is though, folks are copying this straight off MSDN.<br>4) Show unit testing.  Folks aren't good at unit testing, so show it in samples to help people learn.<br>I understand exactly what you're saying.  Its difficult to get a compelling, best practice, unit tested sample in a 1 page blog post.  Doesn't mean you shouldn't try though. <br>I think your Demo Code category is problematic.  If I need your demo code to learn how to do something, will I be knowledgeable enough to turn it into production code?  Probably not.</p>
