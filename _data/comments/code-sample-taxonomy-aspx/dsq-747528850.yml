message: <p>I think "published" doesn't have to be a binary thing here. There's different levels of publishing. There's something in between "show nothing" and "post the source and tons of content with a big splash on the <a href="http://www.asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.asp.net">www.asp.net</a> site". For example, another level might be "throw the source up on Codeplex, say it's a work in progress, write a blog post soliciting feedback."</p>
