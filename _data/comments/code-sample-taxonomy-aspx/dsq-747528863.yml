message: <p>@Karl - point taken<br>@Kyle - true enthusiasm comes from me and not Microsoft. and i think you are kind-of making my point. if Microsoft releases a new Message Bus framework and nobody in the communitity thinks that it is worth it or it misses the mark then i don't care how enthusiastic they are... <br>@Phill - the point being, Microsoft does things really really well. and i think that they are turning the corner as far as becoming more transparent in how they doing things and how things are made better. i for one, however, do not look to Microsoft to train or teach me how to write applications regardless of the framework or bits they are presenting<br>in there lies the problem<br>posting or releasing sample/reference applications does nobody any good if you don't trust the source<br>does that make sense?<br>when i look at what you, Karl, Jeremey, Oren, Joe D, Scott H, and even Eric L post and talk about... i get it. i understand where you are coming from and what you are offering<br>you all help me learn. it could be on Java, Haskell, F#, Lisp, or what ever and the point still remains<br>when Microsoft as a company (which is the key point here) releases something... who are they? who is posting the code? who wrote it?<br>let's make this simple. if i posted code or an application and said it was a reference application on how to do MVC... not only would it take years to wait for the laughter to die down but nobody would take it seriously. <br>why is some group or some team from Microsoft that nobody has heard of any different than i am?<br>so again in my mind... the solution is to stop making sample or reference applications<br>start getting these guys who lead these teams, groups, projects, or what ever out in space. let the communitity decide who they want to hear from. then when those people send out reference applications and sample application their audience is well targeted<br>i wouldn't expect Scott Gu to write a reference application because that isn't what he does. i would expect him to show me some new bits on what they are working on. so where do i go to get the latest scoop?<br>i wouldn't expect you [Phill] to write an application about Share Point. if you did... i wouldn't take it as a sample app or a reference app, i would understand that this would be a prototype or something you are trying out<br>i really hope that makes sense</p>
