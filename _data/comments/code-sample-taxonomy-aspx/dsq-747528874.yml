message: <p>The assumption here is that people should be able to distinguish between the concepts that sample code is meant to illustrate from those other areas that are secondary.<br>A programmer with a certain amount of experience will be able to separate the good from the bad, and take away from sample code what is intended.  A whole other group of programmers will not, or will not know where else to look to fill in those holes. When looking at new tools and technology, the challenge is greater, because a person's previous experiences do not necessarily translate directly.<br>I suspect a lot of people looking for answers end up finding sample code, and treat it as the answer.  And then get condescended by the rest of us, for not understanding the difference between "sample" and "reference" code.<br>My $0.02.  <br></p>
