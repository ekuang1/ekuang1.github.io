message: <p>@Karl, that's an interesting idea, paying Chad, Jeremy, Ayende, etc to produce their sample applications. I'd thought of a similar thing earlier. I think it wouldn't necessarily work out though, aside from the investment. Unfortunately, it might set precedents that cannot be maintained in the long-run. Furthermore, while there's quite a few really good developers out there like those guys, they both cost a ton, as you already mentioned, but they also have considerably less time. Even if they're being paid to do stuff, they still have to fit it into their schedules. That's why I suggested the anonymous mailing list method above - enough people could sign up, and even if some low-quality ones get in, in general, higher-quality stuff is going to come out. That, plus the fact that it would be virtually free for Microsoft, and very good for them, should make it the better deal for 'em.</p>
