message: <p>I wonder if the real issue here is not that Microsoft, occasionally, posts less-than-optimal samples, but rather that there is not an official "best practices" demo for MVC. (Your reservations about "best practices" noted and agreed.) In other words, the faults of Oxite and Kobe would be more easily overlooked if there were another project which existed for the explicit purpose of demonstrating a simple, but well-structured application.<br>Something like NerdDinner, perhaps.<br>One thing that I have observed within the ASP.NET MVC community is that a lot of people really want this. MVC is brand-new, few books are out, and opinions about what constitutes good style are still being formed. Microsoft has great guides for "good style" when writing APIs, for example.<br>In other words, I think that part of the reason that the criticisms of Oxite and Kobe have been so over the top (the applications are imperfect, but I think the nerd rage is unwarranted) has nothing to do with those applications, per se. Instead, the "rage" comes from the fact that they do not meet a particular need that people have, and that they were probably not intended to meet.</p>
