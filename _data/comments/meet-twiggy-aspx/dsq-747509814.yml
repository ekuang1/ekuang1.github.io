message: <p>Ha ha!  No way.  I'm so bad with all this responsibility.  I'm very selfish with my time and schedule.  I love being able to play basketball 3 times a week before work, soccer on the weekends, etc...  Now I have to make room for taking care of this dog.<br><br><br><br>This is a ploy by my wife to break my selfishness and teach me to be more selfless and responsible.  It paves the way for a kid. ;)<br><br><br><br>But it's working.  Twiggy was a good girl this morning.  Yes you were. a good girl.</p>
