message: <p>man i'm such a sucker for sighthounds, now i want to run out and get an IG to keep my whippet company!  she's adorable!  i don't know if the individual you rescued from mentioned it, but sighthounds suffer really bad from seperation anxiety (SA)...i wrestled for weeks with mine before he finally settled in.  i have some cool SA helper tools that i'd be willing to part with for cheap as i don't need them anymore if you guys run into any problems...they worked wonders for me.<br><br><br><br>it's interesting that you mention her owners didn't take care of her...i'm in the process of looking for another whippet; the one i'm looking at right now was also horribly neglected...i don't understand people sometimes, especially with dogs that are this fragile.<br><br><br><br>anywho, congrats, and keep the pics coming!</p>
