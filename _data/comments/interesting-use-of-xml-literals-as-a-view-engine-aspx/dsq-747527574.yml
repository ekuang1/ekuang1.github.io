message: <p>Very much like the Smalltalk framework Seaside works.  Pushes rendering code into Smalltalk code which can then be refactored etc.  (It uses no templates at all)  It's a dream.  I would love to see something similar and as flexible for <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc.<br>If you're unfamiliar with Seaside, go look at <a href="http://www.seaside.st" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.seaside.st">www.seaside.st</a>.</p>
