message: <p>Christa, The group "In Pursuit" was the first band to sign the new MTM record label which Mary Tyler Moore. The album "Standing in your Shadow" had "Thin Line" on it. The video played on MTV and then left without a trace. Mainley because the record co went out of business. Why I dont know, it was a great tune and video. The Album can still be bought on various music sites.</p>
