message: <p>I am looking for a song that no one seems to remember. The lyrics start out like this:<br>Monday morning and it feels too late, how can I deal with the hands of fate, running in circles, running down this empty town to you, I ain't give it all to you, too tired to think the whole thing through, forever the road to get to you...<br>Chorus:<br>walking on a thin line,<br>walking on a thin line,<br><br>If ANYONE knows who sings this song, please e-mail me. I have been searching since I first heard it in 1991.<br>Thanks</p>
