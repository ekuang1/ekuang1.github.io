message: <p>I'm looking for the name of an old (rare) 80's video that would appear on MTV--probably between 1982-84-ish.  It was not "Pink Cadillac (everyone always wants to suggest that first--or the Cars, and it wasn't that, either). <br>It was a video of, to my recollection, a group of about 3-4 guys (one was particulary ugly with gross teeth and hair) who were dressed in plaid and driving around in a convertible.  The video used to play fairly regularly on MTV, but I cannot remember the name of the song nor the video.<br>The video actually used to irritate me a bit, but now I want to see it for old times' sake.  Seems like I remember them stopping at a stopsight or light or something in the video (I was maybe aged 10-12, at best, so my memory has faded.)  I just remember the main guy in the video to be terribly ugly (in a bad hygiene, gross teeth kind of way).<br>Ugh, any ideas?</p>
