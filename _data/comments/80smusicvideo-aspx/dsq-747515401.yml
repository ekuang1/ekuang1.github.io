message: <p>Me again.....Forgot to mention that this song aired regularly on the radio in the Spring/Summer of 1987.  I did not even know the name of the artist until reading this page.  I find it hard to believe that there is absolutely no information on the group (In Pursuit) or the album (Standing In Your Shadow)  Is this a Canadian band?  I have searched google U.K. as well as Canadian music charts and find nothing.  This is a great song with special meaning for me.  If anyone has any information on this song or band please email me.<br>Much appreciation!!<br>Deb</p>
