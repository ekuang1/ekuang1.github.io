message: <p>What are you talking about "cold weather". It's going to get up to 57F this Saturday man. That's bikini weather up here.<br>You're not REALLY going to Seattle though. You're going to Redmond, the eastside. God hates the eastside. So it'll probably rain and snow on you over there. ;)</p>
