message: <p>There are services that measure the tone and mood of the conversation on the Internet. The goal of the service is to discover conversations about your area of interest and then measure the mood, influence and trend. Corporations and government organizations really get into this stuff when they stand to gain/lose a lot based on public perception.<br>It's not too far of a stretch to turn something like this, <a href="http://waggeneredstrom.com/nn/demo/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://waggeneredstrom.com/nn/demo/index.html">http://waggeneredstrom.com/nn/demo/index.html</a>, into a measurement device for conversations around ASP.Net, et al. There are other providers that offer this service too.<br>The license might be out of your budget range, but it would be a sweet graph to see.</p>
