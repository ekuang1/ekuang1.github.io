message: <p>Good luck.<br>I'm not a cynical person, but my first take on this is that this will just be another number for bean counters to pass to their bosses who pass to their bosses, etc. <br>The reason that I call them numbers for bean counters is that they're arbitrarily created and evaluated, but don't do actually do anything. Suppose you score an 8 out of 10, how much would getting a 9 affect MVC use? A 10? How much money would Microsoft potentially lose if it drops to a 6? A 5? How does the number affected investments?<br>The real challenge is to find metrics that can be related higher level metrics, which comes from a methodology known as The Balanced Scorecard. You should be able to relate the success of your efforts to the success of your customer metrics. And you should then be able to relate your customer metrics to profitability.<br>Find a customer measure that can be continuously measured. How, in turn, does satisfaction affect adoption and, presumably, profitability? Maybe you want to look at adoption rate among alpha developers. Maybe you want to do analysis of people actually using MVC -- are they using anti-patterns or bad practices, because they don't know about better ones?<br>Oops, sorry, I forgot that Steve Ballmer is in charge there. (I still remember Ballmer declaring Vista a tremendous success and the iPhone a flop, because it didn't have a keyboard). In that case, send out a survey to all MVPs. <br></p>
