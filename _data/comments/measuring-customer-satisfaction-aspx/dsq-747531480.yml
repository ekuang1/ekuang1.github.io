message: <p>Hmm... I think there's a hidden trap there in the word "quantitatively."<br>I started thinking - maybe a focus group? But then thought you could end up optimizing something like how people felt about their relationship with the framework's brand, or some other tangent.<br>Occured to me then even with the best of intentions any measure of a nebulous concept like performance or satisfaction runs the huge risk of becoming an end of its own rather than the means to measure something else.<br>Like when outsourcing a call center. By the numbers - minutes per call, percent of issues closed on first call, etc. You could be great on paper. But when you seek to optimize those numbers you lose site of the qualitative values. Like the actual service you get is awful.<br></p>
