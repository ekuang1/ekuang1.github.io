message: <p>Like others have said, I think there are a bevy of ways to get some measurable customer satisfaction data, Including <a href="http://GetSatisfaction.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="GetSatisfaction.com">GetSatisfaction.com</a>, and since this question has been asked a year ago a number of other great resources have blossomed.  My own site, <a href="http://StepByStepMarketing.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="StepByStepMarketing.com">StepByStepMarketing.com</a>, has its own section dedicated just to this topic at <a href="http://www.stepbystepmarketing.com/category/daily/customer_satisfaction_research/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.stepbystepmarketing.com/category/daily/customer_satisfaction_research/">www.stepbystepmarketing.com/...</a>  We have highlighted a good number of high quality ideas and external services you can use.  I know I am a little late for the original poster, but hopefully this will help others with similar questions that end up here.</p>
