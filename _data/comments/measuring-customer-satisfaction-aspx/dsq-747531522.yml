message: <p>Measuring the number of downloads doesn't mean much. Most it can say is a lot of people are downloading it. A number has to be a percentage of another number or a rank to be meaningful. How many people who downloaded it are actually using it?<br>The amount of "flood" of incoming bugs is an indication. Feeling the general sentiment in the forums on the web is another. Are people in general complaining or happy and satisfied? <br>Are the common pain points people talk about attack narrow or wide aspects of your product?</p>
