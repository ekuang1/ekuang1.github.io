message: "<p>Before you ask yourself how to measure customer satisfaction (and there are many ways to do it) you need to ask why you want to measure it.  If you're thinking that customer satisfaction is a driver of product take up you're probably going to be disappointed. There is quite a lot of research to show that customer sat is not greatly aligned with product take-up or revenue growth (or anything really).<br>If you want to measure a variable that is more often aligned to growth then I suggest that you look towards <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter\">Net Promoter Score</a>.  This has some good support.<br>How to measure it?  I'd suggest sending an email to downloaders a few days after they had downloaded and ask them the NPS question: How likely would you be to recommend... to a friend or colleague\" along with \"Why do you say that\".  Just two questions. You could use Survey Monkey to do it if you like.  Then do the NPS maths and look at the comments.<br>This is a pretty robust way to start down the path towards really understanding what is driving user loyalty.  We use it a lot for our clients.</p>"
