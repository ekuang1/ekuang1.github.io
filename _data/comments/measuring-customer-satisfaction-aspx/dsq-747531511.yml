message: <p>Instead of trying to think outside the square, try thinking inside it - Microsoft is a big company, with lots of other software projects that probably have the same or similar measurement/reporting requirements. Without knowing the internal politics, I would try and speak to someone else in a similar role that has already done this (in a way that satisfies the powers that be, and is productive). Reuse is not just about software :)<br></p>
