message: <p>The most honest way to tell if a product is successful is the number of clients using it. Checking out how many sites are built with MVC is an obvious way to count the number of users. Afterwards, support tickets, polls, even posts on the blog-sphere can provide some help. <br>For a personal feedback, though, as a client who built a commercial site with MVC 1.0, i'm pretty satisfied.</p>
