message: <p>Wow.  I'm actually working on a product that in part addresses exactly this problem, using MVC as the front-end.  <br>The comments so far have pointed out a lot of the short-comings.  The one that talked about balanced scorecard even went so far as to try to talk about meaning of the counted things, as opposed to just how to count things.<br>Here's what I'm working on.  Ask people what is important to them.  Get real priorities (that's the magic sauce we got).  Let them tell you which is more important, features, or stability, or standard's compliance, or extendibility, or whatever.  Because if you don't know what's most important to people, you cannot really measure their satisfaction.  I mean you can get a number, but not much insight.  If everyone tells you they are really happy with the decor in your take-out pizza joint, that's probably not going to contribute as much to actual satisfaction as the quality of your toppings.  And if you just asked about decor and toppings -- and then averaged the two to come up with one number.  That would be almost as bad.  And it's what most people do.<br>So, what our product does (beta coming out in March -- you can try it for free) is that it creates a simple matrix.  You ask customers to prioritize the issues that are most important to them, and then tell you how well you are performing on those issues.  Combined with demographic info on respondents, these answers can give you very deep insight into what's going on.  We can even track info over time to see if there is a noticeable response/chance after a new release.<br>If you're interested, I'd be happy to share more.  Just email me at my firstname@mylastname.com<br></p>
