message: "<p>Yes, you can measure customer satisfaction. Airlines, <a href=\"http://Amazon.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a>, and the American Medical Association do it all the time. And that's just the \"A\"s.<br>But the prerequisite to measuring is <strong>collecting data</strong>. And that's your problem with Microsoft developer tools like MVC.<br></p><blockquote> how can I measurably demonstrate that [...] my team is responding to customer feedback?</blockquote><p><br>Where is the customer feedback coming from? Current answer: <u>all the frickin internet</u>. It's on blog comments, Twitter, MSDN, Connect, StackOverflow, private emails, etc. There's no one official place for MVC developers to provide feedback. Therefore you can't collect any data, and you can't measure.<br>You need to pick <strong>one place</strong> where your customers are supposed to go to complain. Then you can measure how responsive you're being to feedback and how satisfied your customers are. Talk to some PMs with Amazon's customer service team - they are very good at this.</p>"
