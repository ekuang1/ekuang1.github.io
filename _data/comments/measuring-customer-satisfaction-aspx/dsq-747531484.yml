message: <p>You can't really measure success by counting the downloads, I bet there are a lot of downloads that are never really installed. Even those who are satisfied and re-download them.<br>So without using any of those "Poll"-sites out there, maybe there should be a public ( even more public one ) bug-tracker where the community actually can help each other out.<br>And re-use the "Did this help you"-button from MSDN on all your videos and put a little "1 - 5"-star-rater next to it.<br>That would probably cover a little bit more than just doing an online survey..</p>
