message: <p>Maybe also by how many emails you and your team get over <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc. If you are getting lots of emails and helping people out then thats a good thing. It takes time for people to write emails asking questions, so I would think that this is something worth looking at.<br>Also maybe the number of questions and answer on stackoverflow... it shows how many questions are asked for particular topics, have a look and see what people are taking about.<br>Just a few thoughts.</p>
