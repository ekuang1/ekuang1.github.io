message: <p>I say check the message boards, discussion groups, stackoverflow, etc. Not how many questions are being asked, but how many users participating, answering each other questions, recommending different solutions. How vibrant is the community, how many other user are helping other users. If you're satisfied with a product, you'll recommend it to your friend, you'll help others implement it.</p>
