message: <p>Phil,<br>I ran a query against the Stack Overflow public data dump which shows a steady and continuous increase in MVC questions per month:<br><a href="http://stackql.net/default.aspx?qid=42654" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stackql.net/default.aspx?qid=42654">http://stackql.net/default.aspx?qid=42654</a><br>SO just released another dump, but it doesn't look like it's on <a href="http://stackql.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="stackql.net">stackql.net</a>, yet, so this only goes through mid-September 2009. <br>Still, I hope it's helpful.</p>
