message: <p>using downloads as metrics could be just a part of the measurement stretegy. <br>There  are customers who will download, install, test and use.<br>Then there are clients which download , install and test.<br>Then there are clients which download and test only.<br>Then those who download and install only, but never have time for it and then those who only download and then forget untill after there PM announces that some project is going to have a touch with ASP.NET MVC. <br>I feel all downloads account for only 25 / 30 % of real users<br>your real figures should consist of real customer. A client is one who is your client for life time of the product, not who just downloads.</p>
