message: <p>Frankly, me and thousands of people like me don't like to fill out surveys as they are boring. The best way would be a integrated environment into products which collects data about how customers are using the specific products and on which parts they are mostly spending their times. I don't know it would be violating the privacy policies though. When people are working, if they allow, system can ask short questions about the part they are using and send them to the creator team along with the data collected during system use.<br>For example, lets say, a customer is using Visual Studio. The customer is writing codes within it, he/she probably uses the Intellisense. What if he doesn't like it ? He will probably disable this feature and here is the data you should collect. While he is disabling, system can ask a quick question about the reason and provides a little text box to allow him to write some suggestions. It would be easy and mostly unboring way instead of handing over 100 question surveys.</p>
