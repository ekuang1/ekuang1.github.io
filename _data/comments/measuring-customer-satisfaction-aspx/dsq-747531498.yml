message: <p>I'd avoid using polls since the participants aren't a statistically random set of people. You'll probably end up with either an improbably large number of negative results (since people love registering their discontent) or an improbably large number of positive results (very vocal supporters... which would help you from a corporate perspective but wouldn't accurately represent satisfaction). Online polls where you voluntarily participate aren't really objective.<br><a href="http://getsatisfaction.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="getsatisfaction.com">getsatisfaction.com</a> is probably the best suggestion I've seen. More accessible than your typical issue tracker and allows people to leave both positive and negative feedback.</p>
