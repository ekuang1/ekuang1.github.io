message: <p>I am not saying anything fundamentally different than what is been talked already in the comments. Apart from no. of downloads, blogs, connect, etc here are my two cents:<br>1) Google search results for '.NET MVC' or something. More results means more voice meaning more coverage. You can also present .NET MVC book stat, may be. I believe that people positive-negative expression ration is 80-20. On the net people want to share their experiences and specifically what went well (positive part - 80%) rather than what went poor (neg part - 20%). So, more google results (and increasing...) obviously means good thing. Say, how many people actively consuming Card Space and in turn how the product is performing. Compare google data over a period. (Obviously, you cant do that right away, its a continuous process...)<br>2) Stackoverflow. Yes, it can turn as powerful tool on your side. I know you (and your team) actively follow the threads and try to answer queries in as satisfying manner as you can. You can present your team scores (and also include non MS people but active in MVC community) as to show how much effort you put answering community - and its outcome.<br>Thanks!<br>Dhananjay<br></p>
