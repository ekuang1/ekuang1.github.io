message: <p>Casey, Ok, perhaps "tough" is a poor word choice.  I certainly wouldn't go toe to toe with a vikings linebacker.  I think "hardier" might be a better choice.<br><br><br><br>Your comment backs that up.  And I was more commenting on the weekend warriors and american attitudes than on professional athletes.  I think trying to say one sport is "tougher" than another is meaningless.  But I will say, my rag tag band of soccer players (male and female ranging from their 20s to 60s) is a lot tougher than the so called "tough" guys I play basketball with.<br><br><br><br>Did I say "tougher"?  I meant hardier.</p>
