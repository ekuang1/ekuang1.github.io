message: <p>Yeah, it was crystal clear in the replays. The ball came up, nailed Eskandarian in the forearm, and then went toward the goal. The ref was 30-40 yards back and the linesman had a bad angle, so no way to see it.<br><br><br><br>That first goal was unreal... I couldn't believe DC was giving up so much space. In the replay, you could see that the ball was a pure knuckler. It didn't rotate the entire time it was in the air. <br><br><br><br>Very cool... and a lot more exciting than the "ooh look, yet another draw" Rapids season... :)</p>
