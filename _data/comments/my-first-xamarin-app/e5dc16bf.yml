  Coming originally from your burnout article: What brought the joy of programming back to me a few years ago was to finally get myself into F#. It felt like in the early days :-). And of course there are some geeks who made it possible to build Xamarin apps written in F#. So you can skip all the XAML and MVVM stuff and adopt something that really makes sense ;) – the Elmish Architecture.



  See https://thomasbandt.com/writing-xamarin-apps-in-fsharp for more info (just skip the first two ways).

  PS: Rider has fabulous Xamarin support built-in, so it might be worth trying that combo as well.
