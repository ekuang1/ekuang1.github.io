message: <p>Dude, you haven't been to Moscow :)<br><br>I moved to this one bedroom flat and I have papers for it, it was bought for ~$18500 years ago.<br><br>It's $50000 now, and local sources say housing prices here are about to rise once again.<br><br><br><br>From my ex-gf's experience, a year ago you could rent a one room flat for $150/month easily, now you are lucky if you find one for $300.</p>
