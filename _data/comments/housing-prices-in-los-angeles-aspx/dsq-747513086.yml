message: <p>Temecula? Damn! That would be one HELL of a drive! My brother lives in Temecula, and he has a 1.5-2 hour commute to San Diego! I can'e imagine trying to go north!<br><br>Besides, Temecula isn't too great a place to buy anyway; they have PLENTY of restrictions, and with the casino right there, the property values are going to be in a constant state of flux for years to come, and never when you are ready.<br><br><br><br>Not too sure where in LA you need to be, but have you considered out 14? Acton is boondock-ish, but has great prices (last I checked) and is close enough to Valencia to make it tolerable.</p>
