message: <p>I fully agree.  And upon reflection I think it's wholly acceptable that Moore tries to have it "both ways" regarding his opposition to sending troops and then later complaining we didn't send enough.<br><br><br><br>There's nothing wrong with saying, let's not go to war, but if you do go to war over my objections, then you'd better do it right so that the objectives are met and our troops loss of life is minimized.  By choosing to both go to war, and to half-ass it, the administration is deserving of mocking for both actions.</p>
