message: <p>On the "both ways" issue...<br><br><br><br>We're hearing a lot (and will certainly hear more) of this type of rhetoric from the Bush campaign this year.  It's interesting to listen for it every time someone pro-Bush steps up to a microphone.  Kerry will be portrayed as someone who "waffles" (flip-flops, is disingenuous, take your pick) on the issues.  I can only assume that anyone siding with Kerry will also be labeled as such.<br><br><br><br>What is disturbing to me with all this name-calling is the over-simplification required by this tactic.  Rather than attempt to understand why someone's view might have multiple points (rejection of war, support of proper troop size if war is declared), an attempt is made to dismiss dissent with a sneer and a wave of the hand.</p>
