message: <p>I find parts of that Slate review to be disingenuous.  It makes the point that if Moore would (among other things of a supposed pacifist leaning) have allowed Saddam to keep Kuwait.   However, I'm going to go out on a limb here and hypothesize that if Michael Moore were in charge of the White House, I'm pretty sure the U.S. would not have joined Germany and France in giving weapons to Uncle Saddam to fight the Iranians (and oppress those living within Iraq's borders).  Apparently we are to believe that our aggression is better than (morally superior to) others' aggression.<br><br><br><br>Anyway, would Hitchens have us believe that our current motivations in Iraq are wholly noble?  Please, our soldiers are sitting on the 1/9th of the worldâ€™s proven oil reserves.  End of story.</p>
