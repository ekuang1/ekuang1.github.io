message: <p>I like Manhattans, but also a variant called a 1794 that adds an equal amount of Campari. The 1794 must use rye whiskey instead of bourbon, because it's named after the year of the Whiskey Rebellion, when western Pennsylvania rye farmers fought against federal taxation. It also usually has equal amounts of whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Campari instead of being heavier on the whiskey.</p><p>My favorite bourbon is Blanton's. Really amazing.</p>
