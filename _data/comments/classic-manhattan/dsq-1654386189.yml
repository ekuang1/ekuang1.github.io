message: <p>A cosmopolitan, and you're sure to be noticed confidently sipping a bright pink drink at the bar. Lots of variations, but I usually go with 2 parts vodka, 1 part triple sec, 1 part cranberry, and a splash of Rose's. Shake with ice and serve in a martini glass. It's fun because you can create lots of different variations by adjusting the amounts or swapping out things for the triple sec part (this is the nerd "drink-hacking" appeal), but it's hard to screw it up to the point that it's undrinkable.</p>
