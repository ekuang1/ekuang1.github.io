message: <p>Oooo my drink is definitely an Espresso Martini. The standard one is very good, and there are so many variations to add a flavour, hazelnut (Frangelico), cream (Baileys), vanilla (Galliano, the original one, otherwise sub the vodka for vanilla vodka(Absolut)), chocolate (any Mozart), it all just works!</p><p>Little lower on the complexity ladder my favourite is an Amaretto Sour.</p><p>Below that I actually enjoy a nice Gin&amp;Tonic (But not just any gin ... prefer the more herby ones like Bombay Sapphire or Hendricks).</p><p>And I didn't drink until I was out of university and discovered sickeningly sweet cocktails (Malibu + anything, also good in Espresso Martini btw), it all went downhill from there ;)</p>
