message: <p>My favorite bourbon lately is Angels Envy. It's finished in port barrels and has a very unique flavor. Really good neat or with a little ice. Russell's Reserve 10 year bourbon is also worth a taste.<br>If you ever make it out to northern Utah (there's quite a bit of tech happening here), you should venture to High West distillery in Park City. They make Manhattans with their Rendezvous Rye (another favorite of mine) and bourbon-soaked cherries. Very tasty.</p>
