message: <p>If you are looking to experiment on vermouth, I recommend Dolin. You might have to find a specialty liquor store to find it, but since it's 1/3rd of the drink (give or take) it's worth the effort to find something that isn't cheap swill.</p><p>Try sipping a small amount of whatever vermouth you use on its own. If it isn't good enough to drink without mixing, it isn't good enough to mix.</p><p>If you are enjoying Scotch, the Rob Roy could be your next experiment.</p>
