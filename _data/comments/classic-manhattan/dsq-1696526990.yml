message: <p>I love a good cocktail, especially if the bar has their own unique types that I haven't seen before that will catch my interest.  However for the most part, my drinking has become simplified, when I go out to a bar or club.  I order Vodka and Water, and while I'd prefer to order a decent Vodka, I'll take a bottle of Absolut as terrible as it is.</p><p>Kinda blows people away that I drink it like this..... KISS is my excuse these days.</p><p>As for single malt whiskeys, go get yourself a cask strength A'bunadh by Aberlour.  Myself and many others I know are very appreciative of this whisky.</p>
