message: <p>Tequila. Reprasado preferred, but anjÄ“o if you must. Nice and spicy without the nasty aftertaste of whiskey. (Welsh whiskey and some Japanese ones are ok tho). Neat, on the rocks or with a small amount of lime juice.</p><p>Sake. Mmmmmm. And emo (??) shochu, which is make out of sweet potatoes. Think Japanese vodka.</p><p>And wine, being I live on an island which makes some fanatic big reds (Waiheke, off Auckland, in New Zealand)</p>
