message: <p>Kentucky checking in with some Bourbon recommendations. Give Willet Pot Reserve a chance. Neat bottle and is pretty solid bourbon, and the price isn't so bad that you feel bad mixing it with something else. Weller 12 Year is a must purchase if you can find it, but unfortunately a few years back the secret got out and it got snagged up. Haven't seen it in KY in quiet some time, but if you live in a place that isn't bourbon crazy or full of people reading bourbon reviews online you might be able to find it still. Got a bottle in Georgia recently.</p>
