message: <p>I personally think we should support CodePlex whenever possible.  For a project this size I am sure the development team of CodePlex to get the features that you want.  That is the only way CodePlex will get better and get to a place where it is a true contender with Google Code. <br>I do agree that Codeplex could have a lot of thing improved to make it better, but you can say that about every program / web site.  They way to make it better though is to use it, give the dev team feedback and watch it improve with each new release.<br>That is just my 2 cents.<br></p>
