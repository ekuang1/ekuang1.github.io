message: "<p>Why not implement a text based rendering engine for this?<br>It will make sure no server side code is executed thereby providing better security.<br>I mean would you really want template designers to have that type of control?<br>You could implement a generic code generator engine that uses text based RegEx triggers to render data.<br>This way, you truly seperate presentation from programming logic.<br>E.G. : Ader Template Engine<br><a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/cs/library/adertemplateengine.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.codeproject.com/cs/library/adertemplateengine.asp\">http://www.codeproject.com/...</a><br>String Template<br><a href=\"http://www.stringtemplate.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.stringtemplate.org/\">http://www.stringtemplate.org/</a><br>This is a similar method used by the Smarty PHP Template Engine.<br>The principle is the same. You allow creative freedom without sacrificing security.  There's the added bonus of template caching (if implemented via C#) where the content can be generated each time, but save overhead on parsing the template.<br>It will also allow on-the-fly customizing later on.<br>Even the blog owners can do this themselves without having to upload code (web based template editor?).<br>You have the added benefit that templates will be version independent.<br>Upgrades will go a lot smoother without haveing to reengineer the templates each time.<br></p>"
