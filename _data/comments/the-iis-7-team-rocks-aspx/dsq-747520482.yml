message: <p>Thanks for the warm regards - glad to help out :) I have to say, a lot of time, we take something away that helps us improve IIS7 or understand where we can do more to help people use it.  <br>Please be sure to blog or post your issues on <a href="http://forums.iis.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="forums.iis.net">forums.iis.net</a>, and we'll try to help you out ... especially if its something tricky that is not already covered by a google, I mean, MSN search :)<br>Mike</p>
