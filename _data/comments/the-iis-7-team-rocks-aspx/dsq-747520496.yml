message: <p>So glad I read all the comments!  Somehow the application pool for one of my sub domains was stopped and Jack's comment saved me.  <br>This might be basic for some but I come from a LAMP background where (imho) it's much easier to investigate issues like this.  I don't know how long I might have wandered around without that last comment.<br>Developing/Maintaining complex web apps is hard enough without having to deal with issues like this... I miss linux+apache ;-).<br>Thanks to everyone here!</p>
