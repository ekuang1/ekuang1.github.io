message: <p>Great post.  I'm often amazed to hear from my friends who go through the adoption process how downright investigative it is to determine if the couple will be fit parents for an orphan, yet, for those of us who have biological children, there's no test, no assessment, no financial statements.</p><p>There definitely is nothing better than to see your kids do well, preemptively obey, and otherwise remind you that no matter how stressful parenting can be, it is worth it.</p>
