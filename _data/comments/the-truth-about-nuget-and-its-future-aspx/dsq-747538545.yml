message: <p>For an internal NuGet feed, MyGet looks good. What I did at my work place is set up an internal version of the NuGet gallery (<a href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery">https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery</a>). This was quite easy to set up and gives you all the features of the official <a href="http://NuGet.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="NuGet.org">NuGet.org</a> site.</p>
