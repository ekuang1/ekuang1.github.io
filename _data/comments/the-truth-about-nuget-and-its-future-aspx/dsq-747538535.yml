message: "<p>@John Watson: It seems like the vast majority of NuGet users are package consumers and only a small number of us are using it internally to produce and consume packages of non-public software. For those who want private feeds, TeamCity and <a href=\"http://MyGet.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"MyGet.org\">MyGet.org</a> seem to be the most commonly used.<br>I've been working on a fork of NuGet.Server that I think performs really well even with 10,000 or more packages.
