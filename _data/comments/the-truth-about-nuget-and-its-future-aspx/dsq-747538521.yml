message: <p>So if I wanted to go about implementing a client that can access the NuGet repository from a .NET 3.5 machine only, what would be the correct way to try to get this accomplished? Is it as easy as creating a work item in Codeplex, forking the repository on Github, and submitting a pull request when/if we the community can get it working (assuming I'm not the only person that wants/needs this functionality)? <br>The only way I see to do this today is to download from a machine with visual studio 2010 and .NET 4 and to move the retrieved dlls to the machine in question.</p>
