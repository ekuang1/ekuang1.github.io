message: <p>Hi Phil. I'd look to see if there's any existing issues related to this in CodePlex to see if others have interest in this. <br>NuGet takes advantage of a lot of .NET 4 features and it'd be a lot of work to backport it and maintain both ports. So I don't anticipate the NuGet team wanting to pull that back into NuGet. But you can always maintain your own fork either on CodePlex or GitHub.</p>
