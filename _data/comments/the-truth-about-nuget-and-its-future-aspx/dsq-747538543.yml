message: <p>Please tell me how can I NOT use nuget.  I just started a new projected and find that nuget is literally SHOVED DOWN MY THROAT!  I think nuget is great, and when I'm ready to hand over control I will, but right now I have no choice about it at all as far as I can see.<br>I just want to use my own library of dlls.  I've been getting along fine for years like this.  Sure, maybe I'm "resistant to change" but hell there are still people writing webforms with 1000 lines in a method in the code behind.  Maybe Visual Studio should stop compiling those.  In fact I think that would be great.  I'll use nuget if VS stops compiling crappy code. how's that?<br>R</p>
