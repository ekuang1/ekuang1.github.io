message: <p>It's great to see another snowboarder coming on board!  :)<br><br><br><br>Here's a tip - ask a million people and you'll get at least a million different tips, so FWIW - try riding switch often - even if it's only for a short distance.  I started riding switch on run outs, easier pitches, coming up to the lifts, etc.  After a while, turning the board around got easier, then easy.  Later, riding switch got easier.  Then, riding switch while making turns both ways got easier.  Eventually, I got to where I can pretty much ride either way in a pinch.  It makes it a *lot* easier when riding in the trees (where you are sometimes forced to ride a line you wouldn't pick) and when doing jumps, rails, etc.  It sharpens your balance and makes you a better overall rider.<br><br><br><br>Plus, it's just plain sick when your friends see you take that 15 foot booter regular, flip that sucka around for a 180, then stomp it goofy and glide away.  :)</p>
