message: <p>Thanks for the code sample. Just a minor point; I didn't find the use of extension methods to be helpful in the example code. No offense, but it muddles the use System.Web.Routing that you're trying to communicate across. It also forces me to load it into Visual Studio which I don't always want to do.</p>
