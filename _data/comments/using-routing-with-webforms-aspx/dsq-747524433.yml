message: <p>I'm trying to use this on shared host that doesn't allow reflection, and the methods to render a link apparently uses this because they give me error on this. I don't really understand reflection, could someone point out to me what parts in rendering the link that are reflection and how to get around it? Thanks. Hopefully someone still reads this...</p>
