The code above uses imports from several different namespaces, showing them would save people time there's zero reason to waste.</p><p>So far, here are the ones it relies on: System.Security, System.Web, System.Web.Compilation, System.Web.UI, System.Web.Routing, System.Web.Security.</p><p>Don't go looking for where IRoutablePage is; you won't find it. You're meant to define it yourself, with that RequestContext property, and the implement that on your page if you want.</p>"
