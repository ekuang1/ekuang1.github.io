message: <p>It worked fine, till I switched the web project to use the "Local IIS Web Server" instead of the "VS Development Server".<br>I am using a XP development machine with its local (oldish) IIS 5.1<br>Is there a way to develop against that IIS version?<br>What about IIS 6 on a production Windows Server 2003?<br>Thanks</p>
