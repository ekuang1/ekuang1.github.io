message: <p>Thanks. This is really very useful. But one i am getting one problem in using this with Master page. I found that i can't use &lt;%=Html.RouteLink("/Home", "Login")%&gt; in MasterPage. I can use only &lt;%=Html.RouteLink("/Home", "Login")%&gt; in the page inherited from routablepage class. Is that correct? or any other solution to use &lt;%=Html.RouteLink("/Home", "Login")%&gt; in masterpage.<br>Regards,<br>Saravanan</p>
