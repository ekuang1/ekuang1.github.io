message: "<p>I have implemented your solution and find that it works great, with one exception. I load up a RouteCollection using some data from a database to act as a VirtualPathProvider. When the user hits my domain: domain/abc, the abc part is transalted into a querystring value to pull some data.<br>My issue, is that when the abc becomes a value that wasn't loaded into the RouteCollection, I obviously get errors. How is this handled?<br>Great post,<br>Eric</p>"
