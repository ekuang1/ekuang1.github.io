message: <p>Phil,<br>I normally enjoy all of your posts, although this one not so much so. Even though this is very interesting, it sounds more like a product pitch than something you would normally blog about.<br>I agree that this is a very cool tool, although I couldn't say this is something that I would use. Come up with a tool like CruiseControl or NUnit and you have my attention. Coming up with something like this just seems futile to me.<br>Sorry, just honesty.<br>Sean</p>
