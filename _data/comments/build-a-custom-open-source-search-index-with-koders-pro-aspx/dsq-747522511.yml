message: <p>Hey Sean, <br>I appreciate the honesty. I suppose it's a fine line between writing about what you do at work and coming across as "pitching" a product.<br>This is pretty much what we've spent the bulk of our time working on in the last few months on. I'm more on the website integration aspect, while my coworker Ben on Pro Edition.<br>I was trying to find an interesting angle on Pro Edition that I thought would fit my blog, because I think writing about what I do at work might be mildly interesting. The product pitch feel is due to my lack of writing skills, perhaps.<br>In any case, have you tried <a href="http://www.koders.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Koders.com open source search engine">www.koders.com</a> and do you find that useful at all?<br>One thing I like about <a href="http://Koders.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Koders.com">Koders.com</a> (and by association Pro edition) is being able to share code easily. For example, it's easy to email someone a link to a specific line of code.<br>In any case, I promise I won't pitch anything unless I can write a really interesting use case for it from now on. :)<br></p>
