message: <p>We do work with application/x-www-form-urlencoded when you are sending form urlencoded data to the webserver. <br>But JSON Serialized data is not the same as form urlencoded data. The point of this post is how to send JSON encoded data as the BODY of your HTTP Post request and not in a form field. In that case, you need to change the content type.</p>
