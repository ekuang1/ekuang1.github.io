message: <p>Ha! I got to experience this first-hand during the making of my blog, with nearly the exact same route as the example. I couldn't find a reason for it and didn't want to waste time tracking it down, so in frustration I made separate routes, which finally worked. I'm glad I took the correct turn with the workaround (and that it was a bug in the first place, not just my inability to make valid routes!). :)</p>
