message: <p>Starting from Steve's question, I think there are two very different scenarios for letting the user input some markup:<br>1. The user wants to format what he's writing. I would solve this problem avoiding HTML at all, and using an alternate markup (BBCode, or else)<br>2. The user wants to show some Code, specifically, HTML or Javascript. This is the scenario that should be deeply covered in guidelines and patterns.</p>
