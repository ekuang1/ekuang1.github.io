message: '<p>Phil, thank you for the update, as I thought this may have been an issue with the following type of url: <a href="http://localhost:2368/search/%22tomato%20paste%22" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://localhost:2368/search/%22tomato%20paste%22">http://localhost:2368/search/%22tomato%20paste%22</a><br>However, it seems this is a shortcoming of the MVC handling as there is no way to override the error which ultimately fails because it is trying to map the "tomato paste" to a physical file. <br>[ArgumentException: Illegal characters in path.]<br>   System.IO.Path.CheckInvalidPathChars(String path) +7491909<br>   System.IO.Path.Combine(String path1, String path2) +40<br>   System.Web.Configuration.UserMapPath.GetPhysicalPathForPath(String path, VirtualDirectoryMapping mapping) +114<br>This has been submitted for months as an issue on codeplex - is there a plan to fix this, as certainly it should be acceptable to have input that is not a valid Windows file name?<br>Thank you for any input you can give, as this makes some scenerios not workable. Including some put up by ScottGu for search.</p>'
