message: <p>I use this technique almost every time I have to create a delimited string.<br>Also, if I don't know the size of the array so I can't initialize it beforehand, I use a List&lt;string&gt; collection to add items to, then:<br>string.Join("|", myList.ToArray());<br>It's a small performance hit, but in most cases it can be ignored, and I always prefer code readability and maintainability over premature optimization.</p>
