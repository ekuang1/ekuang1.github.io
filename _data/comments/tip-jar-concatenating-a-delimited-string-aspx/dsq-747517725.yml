message: "<p>I was just going to suggest the same thing that Simon does: 'prime the pump', I think I used to call it.  Of course, having a TrimEnd and/or Join methods is always nice, but if I'm using a language that doesn't have them, I'd much rather prime the pump than try to shave off the trailing delimeter.</p>"
