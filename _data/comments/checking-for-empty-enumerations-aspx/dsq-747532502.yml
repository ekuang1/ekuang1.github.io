message: <p>I really believe you shouldn't set up null-guards across your entire code base. Ensure that you don't call your methods with nulls instead... It's both simpler and prettier; null is a special value with a distinct semantic purpose, which entirely gets lost if we interpret a null value and an empty sequence as the same thing.</p>
