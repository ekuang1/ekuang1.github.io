message: <p>In one of the companies I worked with I would interview C# devs we wanted to hire. If someone was doing particularly well I'd throw this question at him/her and see what they had to say. A bit mean you might think but it was still quite fun :D<br>Also, there's that other chestnut. Is string a reference or value type. And if the answer was that its a reference type (which is correct) then how come the + operator works to concatenate strings? You'd be surprised how many of the new breed of devs don't know about operator overloading (especially those from a Java background ;))</p>
