message: <p>Wow, that is an unfortunate IP gravitar for DotNetKicks.<br>So if the CLR contains a scope declaration, but there's no syntax available for using it. Does it really exist?<br>I thought of those two as independent. protected just means "off-limits for people who aren't me" and internal means "for people who are in my family"<br><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ba0a1yw2(VS.71).aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ba0a1yw2(VS.71).aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/...</a><br>What are the implications for protected AND internal? That restricts accessibility/overideability to only classes that derive from the base and are in the same assembly correct?</p>
