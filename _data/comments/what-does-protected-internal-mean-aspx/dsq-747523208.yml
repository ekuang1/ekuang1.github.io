message: <p>It always surprises me when long-time C# developers don't know the answer to this question. I ask it in interviews and nobody EVER knows. Some of them guess right, but nobody knows it off the top of their head. I understand its not something you ever use, but how do you not learn it the same day you are learning about the other accessibility modifiers?<br>On a separate note, did you really refer to Eilon's anonymous-type-as-a-dictionary trick as "clever"? I think its the ugliest thing I have ever seen, and it scares me to death that the future of C# programming might be headed in that direction.</p>
