message: <p>@Tina - The $50K payout isn't from the managers. It's the price that a club will pay for a three hour session. It's not unlike a software contractor who can charge $150/hr. Sure, it took a lot of dedication to hone your craft to be able to charge that much money. But $13K an hour? I'll take that any day.<br>@JMC - Awww c'mon. Don't rain on our parade. This is all in good fun, tongue firmly in cheek.<br>@Ron - a very fun metaphor. I think improvisation is the attribute I like in the metaphor, which is something that both great jazz musicians and DJs do.</p>
