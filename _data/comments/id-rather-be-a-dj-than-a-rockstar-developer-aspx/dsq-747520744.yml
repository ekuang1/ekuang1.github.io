How about POP-star developer:<br>* doesn't play any instruments<br>* doesn't write his own music or lyrics<br>* can't really sing <br>* can't even mix music<br>* convinces a rock-star to do the music<br>* convinces a DJ to mix it <br>* records a lame heavily edited, and mixed voice track<br>* claims all the credit for the song<br>* can't perform live, unless he is lip-syncing<br>Heh, I worked with these kinds of people - big ego, big salary and absolutely no skill. ;)</p>
