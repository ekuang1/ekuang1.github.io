message: <p>@Phil - I understand there are no extension properties, but since we already have a few helpers (Ajax, Html, Url, etc), it might be nice to have the provider generate a completely new class. RouteLink, perhaps. RouteLink.Home.About(123). <br>Either way, I like it better than the ActionLink extension.</p>
