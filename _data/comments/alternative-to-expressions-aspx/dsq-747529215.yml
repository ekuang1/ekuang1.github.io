message: <p>Using buildprovider will make the method "HomeAboutLink(123)" appear for real only at runtime. Refactoring tools will warn me of calls to non existing methods. What if I change the name of an Action? There will be no refactoring tool to help me change the ActionLink method name in the view.<br>Or am I missing something obvious?</p>
