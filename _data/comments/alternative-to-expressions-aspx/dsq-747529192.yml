message: <p>Having used the mvc futures lambda syntax for a while it seems really natural and the strong typing and refactoring support is a big plus for this way of doing things. If there was a *simple* way to cache parameterised expressions to avoid the recompilation cost on every call I feel that would be a great approach. The build provider idea is undoubtedly a very clever solution to the problem but somehow it seems rather 'clunky'.</p>
