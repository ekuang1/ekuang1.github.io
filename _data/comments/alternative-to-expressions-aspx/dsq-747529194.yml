message: <p>I couldn't see this overload (with generic controller type and an expression) on Url, but only on Html. Will it be available?<br>Sometimes I need the URL itself without <a href="..." rel="nofollow noopener" title="...">...</a> (e.g. for JS).<br>Of course I can work around and make a method that takes the output string and extracts the URL but this should be more elegant.<br>Thanks</p>
