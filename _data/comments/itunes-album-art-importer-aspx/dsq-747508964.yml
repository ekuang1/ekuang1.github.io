message: <p>That is interesting that they could place such a restriction on the album art as they could not possibly own the artwork.  If anyone's copyrights were being violated it would be the publishers.  Windows Media stores all album art locally on the pc.  If you own the cd then you technically should be able to have the picture on your computer and not be in violation.  I work for a law firm that has depts that specialize in copyright law.  I'll post again if I can get some useful info from them.</p>
