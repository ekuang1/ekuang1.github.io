message: <p>Thanks for the input Craig!  Don't worry, I'm not in any hurry to migrate out of SourceForge.  :)<br>It sounds like CodePlex has a great team and over time, it will be worth checking back in from time to time.<br>But it takes time to build a mature product like this.  <br>Sourceforge has been around a while and has plenty of iterations under their belt.  I wouldn't expect CodePlex to come out of the blocks fully realized.<br>I'll wait a few iterations to see what happens.</p>
