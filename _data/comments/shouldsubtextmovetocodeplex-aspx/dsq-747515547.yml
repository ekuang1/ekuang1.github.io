message: "<p>Yes, but I doubt it can be run on CodePlex.<br>maybe it's usefull for those who have TFS running on their own servers.<br>Then, I read Brad's post:<br></p><blockquote>\"That's probably Team Build you're hearing about. Unfortunately, Team Build is not supported on CodePlex.\"</blockquote><p><br>One of the things I liked most in TFS it the Team Build, and the reporting of all the metrics available after a successfull build (code coverage, failed/successfull tests). But CodePlex doesn't have it, so...<br>And if it doesn't have Team Build it also doesn't run the unit testing as they will be run on out CC.NET box.<br>So, what does CodePlex have that SF.NET doesn't?<br>I also requested an account on CodePlex for a personal project, but knowing TFS a bit I did it mainly for the Team Build feature. Maybe when they approve my request (I did it 2-3 days ago) I can tell you more about what are CodePlex features.<br>PS: Brad, if you are reading this and want to speed-up the approval process, my account name is simonech and the project name is keawinemaker :-)<br></p>"
