message: <p>Well I worked with Phil in the day when we had no female software developers.  However, when I worked at the "OTHER" software development shop in Santa Monica we had about 30 developers.  Of those 30 we had 7 female developers.  When I got together with old team members we would ask ourselves if you were to start that company over who would you bring as your  top 10 with had the most talent.  3 of the top 10 (and they would be in the top 6) were some of femaie developers!<br><br></p>
