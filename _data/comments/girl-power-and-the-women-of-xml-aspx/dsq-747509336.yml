message: <p>I don't know where you work, but every place I've worked in over 20 years has had women. <br><br><br><br>Might try looking at the atmosphere of your company and why more women don't feel comfortable applying there. <br><br><br><br>In 1996, there were 378,000 science and engineering degrees awarded. Of these, 175,931 were given to women, 202,217 to men.<br><br><br><br>Many of the sciences were almost equal in participation based on sex -- including math. In computer science, though, there were 7,063 women to 17,706 men -- a greater disparity than most fields. <br><br><br><br>But even at that, women made up almost a third of the graduating program. These probably would have been the women you all might have been interviewing. Now, why do you think your company only got one woman?<br><br><br><br></p>
