message: <p>Phil,</p><p>I'm a fellow developer that started to see the toll my entirely sedentary lifestyle was taking on both my waistline and overall health &amp; energy, and have been a FitBit devotee for the past 7 months.  I too craved the raw data, and started exploring their APIs; you can sign up and play around at <a href="http://dev.fitbit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dev.fitbit.com/">http://dev.fitbit.com/</a>.  I'm betting Hubot may get some more features in the near future :)  Unfortunately the 'intraday' data (detailed minutely data) isn't available unless you're granted access to the Partner API - see <a href="https://wiki.fitbit.com/display/API/API-Get-Intraday-Time-Series" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://wiki.fitbit.com/display/API/API-Get-Intraday-Time-Series">https://wiki.fitbit.com/dis...</a> - but you probably have enough name recognition and clout within their dev team that you could get access ;)</p><p>For a quick and simple option, I also found a script that will pull your data into a Google Doc spreadsheet and can be set up with a timed trigger.  Since I don't have Partner API access (and this relies on generating your own application key/secret under your own developer account), I only get daily data - but this makes it much easier to play with your own graphs and analytics, and keep your own archive of the data.  Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/loghound/Fitbit-for-Google-App-Script" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/loghound/Fitbit-for-Google-App-Script">https://github.com/loghound...</a></p><p>Keep those step counts up!</p>
