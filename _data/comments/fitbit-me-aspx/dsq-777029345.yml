message: <p>I really like my FitBit Zip.  It doesn't require charging (just a new watch battery 3-4 times a year).  I keep it on my belt, as that never goes through the laundry.  It's $40 less than the FitBit One, but it doesn't track sleep or stairs - neither of which were worth $40 to me compared to never having to charge the thing.</p><p>What's the advantage of the $130 Aria scale compared to just manually entering your weight into the FitBit mobile app from a simple $25 scale? </p>
