message: <p>Sweet, I'm all for this in the next release (Wolverine). If you can get this out of the way now it'll have a better payoff later as you find weaknesses in the API. You'll also get a number of people trying to break the application from a plugin so there'll need to be a bit of policing to make sure everyone's playing nice on the playground. Right now there's very little plugin support so you can get away with a lot more than if you had a ton of developers using RSS Bandit as a platform (which it very well could easily become). <br><br><br><br>I would personally take this as a sign that it's something RSS Bandit has been needing. If both you and Torsten both think about this at the same time, something strange is in the air. If Dare chimed in without speaking to either of you, that would have made for a freakishly weird story</p>
