message: <p>I agree as well.  When I was at PDC 05 I was totally pumped about Vista.  However after I installed it at home and showed it to family and friends they were still impressed and want to see the cool features of OS X on my Mac.  <br><br><br><br>What I see is Microsoft is only catching up to what Apple has today and not what Apple is going to release before or just after Vista is released.  That is why I think Apple is really keeping a tight lid on the OS 10.5. From the advancements that keep happening to OS X every 12 months Microsoft can't keep up.  <br><br><br><br>Microsoft needs to hire some of the design engineers from Apple.  But that's not going to happen!  Let me see, Apple stock keeps rising and will probably will split again this year. While Microsoft has been sitting at the same price for about 3 years now.  HMMM... tough call! :)</p>
