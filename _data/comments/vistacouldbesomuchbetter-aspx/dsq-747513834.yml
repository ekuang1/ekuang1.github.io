message: "<p>@Chad:  Developers indirectly do drive sales as it's up to them to develop the \"must have\" applications that consumers simply can't live without.  In this case MS has really shot themselves in the foot though as they're backporting most of the new technology in Vista to XP.  At any rate, it's really gonna be up to  the OEM's to drive Vista sales...most of my non-tech friends don't even realize a new version of Windows is coming out; I mention the word Vista to them and get blank stares back.  It'll take years for businesses to upgrade.</p>"
