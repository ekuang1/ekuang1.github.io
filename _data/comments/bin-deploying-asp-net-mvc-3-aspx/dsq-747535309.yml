message: <p>Excellent idea but has limitations which for me meant that I didn't use it.<br>I store dll dependencies within MyApp\lib folder whereas my source in MyApp\src. <br>I tried to be clever and manually add dll's into this new special folder (_bin_deployableAssemblies), using "Add As Link", and selecting the dll from MyApp\lib folder. Problem is, the dll added to _bin_deployableAssemblies in this way never gets copied by VS2010 into the bin directory when doing a compile.<br>So for me, I'm reluctantly sticking with referencing all the dll's from my csproj file, and setting Copy Local to True :-(<br>Christian</p>
