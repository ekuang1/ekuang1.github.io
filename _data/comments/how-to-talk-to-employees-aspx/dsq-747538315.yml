message: <p>There is also a fallacy about obsessing over a poorly chosen example and missing the actual message. The original post was less about work-from-home productivity and more about communicating an unpopular change in policy. Given that the managers have already studied the issue and taken feedback from the employees, and limiting work from home was the best option, how do you write the memo? I think the second one was an improvement for the simple fact that it acknowledges that the decision will be unpopular and gives some reasoning to show it wasn't made on a whim.</p>
