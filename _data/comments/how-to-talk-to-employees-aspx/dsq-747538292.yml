message: <p>You've been working too much for corporations where plain and straight to the point speak, and lets be honest, honesty itself has been extinguished. Its at the point where everything is so sugar coated and everyone is spineless that you need to parse every communication for real meaning.<br>You write for example in your email:</p><blockquote><br>Over the last month, several managers have been concerned about our ability to get collaboration-dependent projects completed. We need to better understand the root cause of why our productivity has declined.</blockquote><p><br>Why is this sent to everyone instead of being addressed on individual basis? If managers see productivity loss they know who produces less and instead of talking to individuals and asking them why are they producing less and addressing issue directly, pointless email is sent so everyone can waste time trying to figure out why Fred is not delivering?<br>And yes, some people cannot work effectively from home and they need to be away from home since they don't have self discipline to work from home. That also need to be address individually and in straight forward manner. If you see someone is not working at home you talk to them directly to find out why that is. If you don't get good answer you bring them back into office. If they still don't deliver you again talk to them and tell them openly that they are not living to their part of obligation when they accepted the employment and that if that continues they will be let go... And if they don't improve you have to let them go.<br>Nobody benefits from obfuscated conversations and coded messages. Be open, be honest, but be kind. Nobody can improve if they don't know that they are doing something wrong... Its not fair to anyone including your company and shareholders...</p>
