message: <p><em>"we can’t improve what we don’t measure..."</em><br>This was the real clue to me that we're pretty firmly in a misguided version of Theory X.  Kitty Locker put a spin on the Golden Rule she called "You Attitude", and that attention to including only what's important to your reader, not what's important to you, is what's lacking (as Haack also points out).  <br>"We feel we can't improve without added surveillance of you, the proles.  Therefore, you will be checking in."<br>Getting the feeling we're getting close to the proles saying, "I have eight different bosses right now... That means, when I make a mistake, I've got eight people coming by to tell me about it."<br>That's not how you improve, Fishkin.  And that's why this "improved" email finds its readers tuning out.<br>The real problem here, especially with what the imagined manager's motivations reveal in that example email, isn't just productivity.  It's probably closer to what Zula finds to be true in Stephenson's REAMDE -- "As hire As; Bs hire Cs."  Sounds like you've got some Bs and Cs.</p>
