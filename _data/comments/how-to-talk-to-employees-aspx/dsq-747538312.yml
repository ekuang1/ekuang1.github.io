message: "<p>In my, yet short, career life, I've been through the exact same example : Initial turn off of remote access for everyone then allow some people to get it back to their manager discretion.<br>I had a discussion with the CTO after that decision and found out he had no idea of how people felt betrayed after a mail like this one, especially while the company facing a major crisis where trust was at stake, and was naive enough to think that \"manager discretion\" would be fair and equal. How hidden could be understood ?<br>This reaction is exactly what you point out : No one likes being told and punished as a child and manager vision is limited to their own scope.<br>Respect is what everybody should get.</p>"
