message: <p>Chris Rogers nailed it. This is a nice reply you have here, but to the wrong point.<br>I agree with Rand that explaining the <strong>cause</strong> of a bad company policy change is much better than just saying "things will be like this from now on". Everyone usually wants to know <strong>why</strong>, don't they?<br>But as to your point, yes, if N people screw up, you shouldn't punish everyone, although that frequently happens, and that includes the company I work for.<br>Also, Overhead? That made me laugh out loud. Which is bad, because I fear a "no blog reading" company policy e-mail is being written as a consequence.<br></p>
