message: "<p>@Abe: there might well be. But how awful would it be to cater your entire management philosophy around those people to the detriment of the Theory Y folks? As Steve points out, perhaps they're theory X because you treat them as such.<br>At some point, you will hire a bad apple. The question is, how will you respond to that. Ideally, the person can be won over to Theory Y. If not, it's time for them to take their X somewhere else.</p>"
