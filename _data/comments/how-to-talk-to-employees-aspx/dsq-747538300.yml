message: "<p>@Chris, @Gorazd: I understood the point of the post, and yes, I addressed something slightly different than his main point.<br>The scenario he chose is an extremely poor example to demonstrate his point. He gives two examples of how to deliver this bad news. I'd give a third. Don't send an all company email. Have managers talk to employees directly and get them involved.<br>But there is no one-size-fits-all approach here. In the scenario Rand concocted, the \"bad news\" is really a poor policy decision by management. Best way to deliver that news is to correct the decision, not send a sugar coated email.<br>It would have been a stronger post if the scenario was such that the bad news was not a poor decision policy, but perhaps some external bad news. Or a good decision the company was behind still went bad as these things happen. How would a CEO respond in that case? That's a compelling topic and perhaps would make a better example for Rand to cover.</p>"
