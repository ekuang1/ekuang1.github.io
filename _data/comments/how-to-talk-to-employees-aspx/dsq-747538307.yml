message: <p>i think that you as CEO or whoever shouldn't sent such emails(no matter how well is everything is defined) if you want to solve any problem.<br>Because from my experience any message will be misunderstood, so the only and best way from my point of view is to discuss it with your team first and after that your reports can continue further communication (emails, discussions, etc...) in smaller groups.<br>"TO ALL" emails must be used only for stating accepted decisions after initial discussions</p>
