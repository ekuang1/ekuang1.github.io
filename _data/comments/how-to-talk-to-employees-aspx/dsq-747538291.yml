message: <p>I was just reading your blog post and I got to the last paragraph and all of sudden I was like "holy shit, this whole post was about something I didn't learn about until the last paragraph".  In general I really enjoy the flow your blog posts, but in this case, it feels like the introduction to a much larger argument and I didn't see the "to be continued" link anywhere.  That being said, it was a great introduction.  <br>I personally have tons of thoughts on asynchronous communication, unfortunately, I don't feel like posting them here at all because you stated no validating reasons why you are in favor of it for discussion (not that I'm against it, just that you are clearly for it).  So this whole post to me is kinda like... how the fuck do I comment... except for asking you to continue writing more about so we actually have something to talk about.</p>
