message: "<p>Hey Phil,<br>I agree with what you've said - and quietly wish I'd had more managers like you over the years.<br>I do feel the need to point one thing out though : I think you've taken on too much of the hypothetical situation which Rand is painting and less on the point he was attempting to make.  Rather than focusing on the specific point of whether or not workers should be working from home etc - I think he was more interested in discussing \"how\" you deliver news which isn't great.<br>The \"decreased productivity\" was just a vehicle for that discussion.<br>BTW, the best manager I ever had was someone who quite often would chat over a coffee - and was geniunely interested in life and family, not only on my output for the day.  And I can honestly say that I found no lack of motivation to be productive for him.<br></p>"
