message: <p>When I read fluff emails from managers, I feel that my intelligence has been insulted. I like to think that I was hired because I'm smart enough to get the job done, but when I get these types of emails I feel like I'm being spoken down to. Give it to me straight, and don't send an email, just talk to me.<br>Good managers should know who the culprits are and a quick one-on-one, wtf-is-going-on, meeting seems more appropriate than a new company policy. <br>Chris Rogers has an excellent point about managers that care. I whole heatedly agree. I have personally had a WTF meeting once from a manager that cared, and I walked away feeling chastised but motivated because I didn't feel like he was out to get me.</p>
