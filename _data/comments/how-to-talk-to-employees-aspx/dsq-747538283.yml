message: <p>Nice Post.  <br>I like the amended email you suggested.  My only comment would be to remove the last two lines.  I understand bringing some levity to the situation but this is an email from a CEO (or some higher-level executive) to his team of managers regarding a serious matter.   <br>Similar to your points about treating the employees like children, sometimes managers (and even some employees), if they are good and care, want the orders from above without any fluff and will want to participate in bringing forth a resolution.<br>Adding some extra fluff in this type of email could be looked at as a hedge on the part of the sender and lacking some confidence both from the perspective of "is this really an issue?" and “will my managers cringe by my sending this?”.  <br></p>
