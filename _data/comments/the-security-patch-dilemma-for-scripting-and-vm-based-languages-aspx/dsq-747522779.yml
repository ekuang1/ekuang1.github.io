message: <p><strong>@Aaron</strong> - I agree with the idea that there needs to be some sort of automated patching process... but this is especially tricky with web applications. Another thought is to just have a <a href="http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2007/05/25/does-web-software-need-a-check-engine-light.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Does Web Software Need a Check Engine Light?">Check Engine light</a> that will alert users that a fix is available.<br>This is still something that I plan to add for Subtext... as soon as I find that 25th hour of the day, or a rich benefactor that will pay Phil and I to do this gig full time. :)</p>
