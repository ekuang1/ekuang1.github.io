message: <p>I think it's because Fowler uses events in the C# example from the MVP page of eaaDev. It's true that it decouples the view from the presenter, but I am not sure it is worth it vs readability and ease of writing tests. We are experimenting as well so it is interesting to see where you end up.</p>
