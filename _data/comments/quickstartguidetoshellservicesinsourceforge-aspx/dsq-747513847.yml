message: <p>Having now done work on both sides of the fence, I really do see the value that the *nix community brings when it comes to working collaboratively .<br><br><br><br>When I first started using the Unix side of my OS X  I hated it because it was not like Windows and I felt like they were so far behind.  However, the more and more I started playing around with it I've to realize that Windows had created a very lazy community with security as a complete after thought.  I decided to change the way we did things at our company and started implenting more of the Unix way.<br><br><br><br>I rarely use FTP now but instead use SSH for all my file transfers. We've gone 100% to CVS and stopped using VSS. Bugilla over hmmm....Excel.  <br><br></p>
