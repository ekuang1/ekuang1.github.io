message: <p>Nice idea Eric.  But how do you feel about yourself after collaborating with the devil like that? ;)<br><br><br><br>I imagine it depends how FETCH ABSOLUTE works?  Is it going to do some kind of iteration for each row you fetch or does it index the rows?<br><br><br><br>It sounds like this approach could be faster for small selection of random rows from a really large table, but not for large selections from a large table.<br><br><br><br>But then again, I'm merely speculating.  I'd want to measure, measure, measure.<br><br><br><br>Phil</p>
