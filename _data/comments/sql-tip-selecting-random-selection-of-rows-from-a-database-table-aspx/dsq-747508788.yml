message: <p>To be "really random", you must have another null column where you can fill it if the corresponding row is selected. Note that the selection statement must include a where clause, on which it must select where the column is null.<br>eg. SELECT TOP 10 column1 FROM someTable WHERE column2 IS NULL ORDER BY NEWID()<br>Then you need to update the column2 setting it a value like 1.</p>
