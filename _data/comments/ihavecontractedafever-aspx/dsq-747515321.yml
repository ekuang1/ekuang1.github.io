message: "<p>@Steve Harman: The ref in Italy - US did a very good job actually, in fact the first yellow card for Pope should have been red straight away. The second one was clearly a yellow card.<br>The Italian red card was one of the dirtiest fouls I've seen so far. McBride sure was motivated afterwards :).<br>I enjoyed that match a lot, in soccer a well motivated team like US can really give their opponent a hard time.<br>These things I noticed about the US:<br>- they play a VERY physical game. (they remind me of the Belgian way of playing)<br>- the strikers dribble the ball a lot. (what is very cool to watch)<br>- Beasly's nickname should be Roadrunner...<br>Hopefully they play their next game with the same fire.</p>"
