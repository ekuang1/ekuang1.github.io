message: <p>This <i>fever</i> you mentioned must be going around... I seem to have come down with it as well.<br>I couldn't believe I had to follow the USA vs. Czech Republic game on ESPN Game Cast due to it taking place in the middle of my work day. At least I was able to catch it on the DVR last night - disappointing as it was.<br>Seeing as you don't have cable, can I take that to mean you don't have access to ESPN2-HD/ABC-HD? How horrible. Those German fields look brillant on the 53" <b>HD Widescreen</b>!<br>Go Team U.S.A.!</p>
