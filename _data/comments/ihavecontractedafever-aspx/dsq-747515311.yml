message: <p>Yeah, I am watching it on ABC-HD and Univision-HD.  Soccer never looked so good.  It looks even clearer than when I play in person. ;)<br>If the U.S. can pull it together and get a better game out of Beasley and Donovan, they might have a chance against Italy. But it doesn't look good right now.</p>
