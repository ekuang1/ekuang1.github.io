message: <p>Well Simo... looks like the US was able to (nearly) pull off the win, but I'm happy with the tie too. Those refs totally blew that match though. Italia's red card was deserved, but that red against Pope - two minutes into the 2nd half - was just rediculous!<br>Well, now all that matters is that the US takes down Ghana and the Italia can knock off the Czechs. So I say, Go Team USA, and Go Italia!</p>
