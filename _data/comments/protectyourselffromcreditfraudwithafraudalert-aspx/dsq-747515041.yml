message: <p>I am a veteran and have been notified by the VA that my records may have been stolen and are now in the hands of someone who may try to use my identity.  I therefore request that I be furnished a free copy of my credit report and a fraud alert be placed on my credit report.  I am retired and cannot afford involvement with identity theft.  It is my understanding that you will also notify the the other two credit reporting agencies.  If additional information is needed, please e-mail me at jfburks3@cox.net   .<br>Thanks very much for your assistance.</p>
