message: <p>We just heard on the TV that about 93000 records have been stolen from the Veterans Administration, of which I could be one of them. I would like to have a fraud alert put on my credit report to avoid identity theft, I am retired and can not afford to have identity theft.  If you need more information please contract me at the above website.  I understand that you will contact the other two credit reporting agencies, is that correct?  Thank you.</p>
