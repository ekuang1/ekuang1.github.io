message: <p>Sweet.<br>Given the "any character as a route separator" thing, are you considering making greedy parameters possible in the future?  I might want something like this, for instance:<br>/{path*}.{extension}<br>Also, why's the / still considered a separator, rather than treating it like the .?</p>
