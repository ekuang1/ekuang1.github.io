message: <p>@Rodj unfortunately, by the time ASP.NET Hands us the route, that %2f is already unencoded. So there's no way for us to see that as anything other than a "/". <br>The only workaround I can think of is to replace "/" within categories with a well-known character when generating URLs and after matching URLs. I'll dig into this some more to find out if there are other options.</p>
