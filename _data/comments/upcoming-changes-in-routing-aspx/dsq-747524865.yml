message: <p>I'm having the same problem as Rodj (I have a / and \ in a category name) There should really be a way to do this properly. How about adding in some property (or character) to tell it it will have a certain number of slashes. Also shouldn't the {id*} thing work?<br>There must be a way to do this - / and \ characters should be usable if they're url encoded at least.</p>
