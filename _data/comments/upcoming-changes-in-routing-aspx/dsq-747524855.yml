message: <p>Thanks Phil, I figured that may have a showstopper for the idea but I had to throw it out there anyways. Subdomain seperation is clean and elegant in a lot of scenarios. I imagine though that if someone is willing to go through the hassle of getting the routing setup on the server, they certainly wouldn't mind writing a few lines of code to handle it in the code.</p>
