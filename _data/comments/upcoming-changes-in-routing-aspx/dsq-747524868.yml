message: <p>Am having the same problem as "Dirk", certain routes interfere with the /WebResource.axd and /ScriptResource.axd handlers. This leads to Ajax not working correctly or failing completely. Is thre any solution for the same...?<br>Even i tried with Routes.IgnoreRoute option also, but no use.</p>
