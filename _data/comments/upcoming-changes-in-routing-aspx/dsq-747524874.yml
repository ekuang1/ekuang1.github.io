message: <p>I am having problems with this routing.  The {code} I am using is entered by the customer, this code must be exactly as the customer enters it because it maps to a back-end customer server.<br>So when the customer has a code with a forward slash in it such as N/A I end up with<br><a href="http://myserver/mycontroller/action/N/A" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://myserver/mycontroller/action/N/A">http://myserver/mycontroller/action/N/A</a><br>A forward slash in a customer code is not unusual, the same for other codes such as "A:B" which results in a "Bad request".<br>I use ActionLink extensively throughout this Intranet application because it saves me so much time by picking up values from previous requests.  e.g. going from mycontroller/index/a/b/c/d/e to details will fill in the a/b/c/d/e for me automatically from the routes, so I don't want to have to resort to creating the urls myself.<br>What about allowing something like this?<br>routes.MapRoute("", "{controller}/{action}/{code}",<br>  new { "code" = UrlParameter.Optional + UrlParameter.Base64Encode});<br></p>
