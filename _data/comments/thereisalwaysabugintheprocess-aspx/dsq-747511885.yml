message: <p>I learned a long time ago that process supports mediocrity.  When the standardization of parts and the assembly line employed this type of thinking to kick off the industrial revolution, it was with good intention.  It was with the intention of removing inconsistency and inefficiency.  This only worked with a perfect process (every exception taken into account).<br><br><br><br>My hard-learned lessons on process have been in the field of software development.  I've worked with dozens of companies, each with their own idea of a development "process."   In the end, I have come to the conclusion that good people outweigh good processes two-to-one.<br><br><br><br>My guess is the problem you ran into had more to do with the management's hiring practices than it did with their process.  They were willing to hire a minimum-wage worker that they didn't have to trust to make decisions at the risk of disappointing the occasional patron.<br><br><br><br>- Sam Marcuccio<br><br></p>
