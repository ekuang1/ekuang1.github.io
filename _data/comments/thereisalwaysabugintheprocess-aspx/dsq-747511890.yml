message: <p>Gee.  I wonder what the theater that was?  <br><br><br><br>My guy overrode the system but proceeded to lecture me for a few minutes on the "right" procedure for validating my ticket.  It seems that $1.50 + 4 hour validation from the theater + leaving before the 4 hours are up are not enough to exit the parking lot.  You have to add the cost of listening to an idiot defend the stupidity or lack of intelligence of their system and their employees!<br><br><br><br></p>
