message: <p>The attacking players have every right to attack any other players they please (provided the game allows them to do so). <br>It is therefore unreasonable for any online groups to try to represent some sort of demographic (racial, sexual orientation, religion, etc). <br>This is because ANY aggression towards them could be interpreted as a 'hate crime', when there are simply other players who wish to have a fight. <br>Given the huge amount of predudice in online games, it would seem overkill to declare circumstances such as this to be as extreme as a 'hate crime'. <br>On the other hand, players should keep their person lives far from the reaches of any online players. The whole point in MMORPGs it to 'Role Play' as the name implies. <br>If you start introducing aspects of your personal life into an environment where people can attack you in virtual combat or through communication, exactly that will happen. <br>Perhaps the issue isn't even perceived hatred against certain sexual orientations, but the fact that games are meant to be played, not lived. <br>Love/sex and games really should not be mixed, especially if you feel emotionally hurt by the viirtual world as you do in the real world.</p>
