message: <p>Hi Phil, thanks for the mention! I'm really looking forward to the outcome of blog matching challenge. <br>@Grim - If you don't read a blog because of the political opinions of the writer(s), you probably won't read all that many blogs. I probably don't agree with all of Scott's politics either, but that doesn't keep me from reading one of thing most informative and important technology blogs out there!  Besides, I don't remember the last time I read an overtly political opinion on his blog.</p>
