message: <p>Lets get over my surprise that someone at Microsoft is allowed to use CVS and deal with the issue...<br>Somehow, and I'm not enough of a CVS guru to explain WHY, the server and the client got confused. Yes, this seems more likely to happen when adding a ton of files.<br>At some point in adding directory foo CVS creates a new directory on the client called CVS. It populates this with information about what to add to the server, then it goes to the server and creates the new directory called foo. You are getting an error after step 1 and before step 2. They way you can tell this is to go to the server and look for foo. It won't be there.<br>OK, to solve this, instead of using a nuclear bomb (what you suggest) we can use a scalpel. Just go to the foo directory on the client and remove the foo/CVS directory. (IF foo has subdirectories, you will have to get rid of any CVS directories in there) Now go cvs add those directories and their files again. This time it should take. <br><br>The other obvious source of this problem is a nitwit that has messed up permisions on the server... look into that before going down this road.</p>
