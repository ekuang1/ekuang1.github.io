message: <p>Yay, I love all this side-effecting code.  Who cares is side-effecting is universally recognized as a nasty, global, non-OO practice?  I mean, it is really cool when you look at code and have absolutely no idea how it will behave at runtime because magic attributes in obscure code locations are injecting behaviors everywhere.  <br>One thing is for sure though - by the time you figure any of this out, another dot release from Microsoft will completely change the infrastructure yet again.  Talk about fracturing your developer community.</p>
