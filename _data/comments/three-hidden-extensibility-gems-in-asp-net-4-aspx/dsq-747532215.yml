message: <p>@Chris there's nothing special about a web app as far as ASP.NET is concerned at runtime. It gets compiled as just another assembly. So I can't imagine there'd be any weird side effects.<br>@Bret One obvious one would be to register a custom build provider. For example, Subsonic used to ship with a build provider. With this approach, manual configuration in web.config would've been unnecessary.<br>You'll see more examples coming from our team in the future.</p>
