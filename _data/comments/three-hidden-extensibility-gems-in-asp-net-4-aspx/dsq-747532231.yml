message: <p>Never knew these extensibility APIs existed- why is it you think these arenâ€™t better publicized? I love the fact that you can register a custom build provider programmatically with this API, plus the efficiency of installing the build provider in one step! I see smaller web.config files in the future with this gem...everyone has to love that!</p>
