message: "Great post and resonates with very well with me as I was looking to bump up my posting frequency. It will be also a good experience to watch how your posts shape up.\r\nI have been doing a similar approach of having the post in a Dropbox folder while in draft and then pushing up to git repo only when ready to be published. Thinking of doing the same that you are experimenting here and also make them available through the website under 'drafts' or similar. \r\n\r\nAre you targeting any fixed number of posts per week/month etc?\r\n\r\nGreat post and looking forward to see more of your writing."
