message: <p>@Nicholas - Well nobody is forcing Twitter'ers to write about jumping in the shower.  You might see some of that in the public timeline, but the public timeline is not where the value lies in Twitter.<br>You can choose which friends to follow and which ones to allow following you, creating a private timeline. You don't have to listen in on the public timeline. <strong>You</strong> have the power to shape your Twitter community.<br>Thus the value in Twitter is proportionate to the quality of <strong>your</strong> Twitter community.<br>For example, my friends don't generally write about tying shoelaces. Instead, it's more like a running chat commentary often with clever wit and interesting links.<br>The other thing I recommend is to turn off the *ping* noise. Just read through your Twitters when you're taking a break to avoid the continuous partial attention effect.<br></p>
