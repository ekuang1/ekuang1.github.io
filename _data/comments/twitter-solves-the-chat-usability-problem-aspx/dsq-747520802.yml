message: <p>While it is true that Twitter solves these problems, and it is interesting from that point of view, I find Twitter to be almost completely worthless, in that I really don't need to be innundated with that kind of minutae.<br>I mean, what is the real-world problem here?  The technical problems have been overcome, but was there ever really an issue with me not knowing that you jumped into the shower this morning, or that you used a double knot for your shoes as opposed to a single knot?<br>If that's a problem, then the world is in a sad sad state.<br>It works great if you have pre-existing connections with people and this technology enables the group to become more tightly knit, but I see nothing about it which helps to enable new communities.<br>Which leads to the part about noise...  I really don't htink that this helps with reducing noise levels.  If anything, it enables them by making the person feel more important in relation to all the others by focusing the channels on them.</p>
