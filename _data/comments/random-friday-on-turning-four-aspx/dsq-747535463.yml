message: <p>Unfortunately, my son (2 yrs. old in July) will be taking over the world too.  Maybe they can work together on this world domination plan, as we don't need any more conflict.<br>And after having lived in the Cayman Islands for 3 years and befriending numerous Brits, it no longer feels right to call it Soccer.  Whether that's because I fear their drunken tirades or not is beside the question...</p>
