message: <p>Haha, this post made me chuckle. 1) because I have a 4 year daughter! You think a 4 year old boy is bad! :) 2) because I run a blog that would do great with a Random Friday strategy, because the current strategy leaves the blog very outdated! :-) Hope to see more random thoughts like this! Thanks for involving the family in your post. <br>PS. I'm going to use the zombie tactic, if given the chance :)</p>
