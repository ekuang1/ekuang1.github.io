message: <p>Actually, "Soccer" is pretty much used in Asian countries and not "Football". It's accepted as a universal way of distinguishing between American Football ("Football") and Football ("Soccer") else it's confusing as to which one you're referring to (especially when people are aware and do watch both).</p>
