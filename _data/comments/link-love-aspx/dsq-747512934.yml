message: <p>From a marketing perspective...<br><br><br><br>With posts on the topics that you have, the majority of your viewers are probably tech-inclined. Given that the largest generation of tech-inclined Americans are ages 14-27, I wouldn't doubt that your statistics being down has something to do with the fact that most schools started last week/this week. <br><br><br><br>Don't worry though! Once everything gets settled in you should see your hits coming back!</p>
