message: <p>Is there some way for us, the users of one or more popular email <br>clients/systems/etc, to implement this idea on our own? Or do we perhaps<br> need it to first be implemented by the Outlook, Exchange, <a href="http://Outlook.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Outlook.com">Outlook.com</a>, <br>Gmail, Yahoo Mail, etc team? Why don't you go rant at them?</p><p>How  would you implement your auto-auto-reply? Via an automated <br>filter/rule/etc? Why don't you use that automated thing to automatically<br> delete the autoresponses? That should keep your blood pressure down.</p>
