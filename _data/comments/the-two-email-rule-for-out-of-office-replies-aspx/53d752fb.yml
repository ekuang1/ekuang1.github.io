message: "Here's the thing though. If I'm on vacation, on the day I get back, I do a big \"SELECT ALL\" and delete every fucking email that arrived during my absence. If I don't do that then two things happen: (1) people get the idea that work piled on my while on vacation will get done when I get back and (2) I have to do remedial work to make of for the fact that I was on vacation.  Both of these events defeat the whole purpose of vacation which was established during the industrial revolution to increase worker productivity when they got back.  So, the OOR is absolutely key because it conveys the message that whatever they just sent might as well not exist because it will not receive a reply, ever.  "
