message: <p>I've been trying to understand your point of view with an open mind for like 10 minutes now, and I don't get it.</p><p>If I email someone, I'm trying to get info from them, or I'm trying to provide them with info that I think would be important to them.  In both cases knowing they won't be reading it for 3 weeks is helpful.</p><p>If you don't care if the person reads your email, and possibly responds, then why were you wasting THEIR time by emailing them in the first place.</p><p>Hell, i'd be fired if I went on vacation and didn't setup an auto reply, and left clients or important business contacts just hanging.  If we are only talking about personal email, then it would just be rude.</p><p>Obviously it's stupid to auto reply to a mass email list.  If that's a serious issue in your day to day activities, find lists with better people.</p>
