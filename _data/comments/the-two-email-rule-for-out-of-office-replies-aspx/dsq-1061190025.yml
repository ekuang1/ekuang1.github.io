message: <p>There are only two things about email that I hate more than auto replies, not necessarily sorted from most to least hated:</p><p>1) Read notification request. This, seriously, gets to my nerves. Not only it's not part of standard mail protocols, it's also a huge conceptual violation of privacy. You want to know if I read your mail? If I desire so, I'll let you know with a meaningful reply. I thank google for not supporting at all read notifications, and when I'm forced to use outlook I turn them off as the first thing I do.</p><p>2) Empty subjects. I mean, really? And people gets angry because I have a rule that automatically deletes permanently emails with no subject without even showing them in my inbox. If you want me to read your mail, take that little small time to make sense in it.</p>
