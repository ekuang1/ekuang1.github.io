message: <p>I have currently my Out of Office enabled, inside my organization only. Not because I'm narcistic, but a lot of other people are expecting me to read and respond to email all day, even during my holiday. So it's better to disclaim them I'm not reading it. I'd rather drop the OoO reply, but had bad experience without it. I should spend some time creating a rant about that ;) <br>Secondly, the use of email for contacting large groups of people? Can't you use Google Groups, Yammer or whatever community tool for that?</p>
