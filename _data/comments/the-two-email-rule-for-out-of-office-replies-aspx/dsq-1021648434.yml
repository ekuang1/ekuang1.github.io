message: <p>Some of us get regular "could you do X" type emails from external clients or internal stakeholders and to not have an auto-reply set up informing them that there's noone at the other end of the line dealing with their request is the equivalent of ignoring their request, which can lead to pissed off customers.</p><p>It takes 2 seconds to read an auto-reply, process that the person is not there and then delete it. I find auto-respond emails courteous and when I receive them I make a mental note to not direct requests etc to that person until they're back so as to not clog up THEIR mailbox.</p>
