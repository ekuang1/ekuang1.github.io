message: <p>If your work is completely meaningless to everyone, then they will have no use for your out of office reply, but then why are they emailing you in the first place? If what you do is even remotely important to anyone, OoO replies are not only courtesy, but necessary. Sure, there are plenty of imbeciles who send emails with no real purpose, but my OoO isn't in place for them, it's for the people who actually have cause to email me.</p><p>This post posits an unbelievably stupid and narcissistic point of view, basically saying, "I'm entitled to email you, but not only do I not care about your response, I'll be inflamed if you dare respond." Grow up.</p>
