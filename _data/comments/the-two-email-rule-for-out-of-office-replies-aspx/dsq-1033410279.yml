message: <p>You've heard of "Inbox Rules"? If I have to email someone TWICE and THEN I get an auto-reply from them my impression is that they're a freaking snob who doesn't care to answer email or let me know that the reply will take longer. Gee, it's not like there isn't time sensitive email, where knowing someone is out is important so you can react accordingly. You want us to initiate a conversation but when you get an automatic reply get upset about it, when YOU are the one who starts the email thread? That's pretty narcissistic. This post is simply from the very niche view of someone who is on many email lists. Just use inbox rules.</p>
