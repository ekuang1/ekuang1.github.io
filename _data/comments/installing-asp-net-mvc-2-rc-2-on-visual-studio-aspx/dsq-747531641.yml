message: <p>I'm still having trouble trying to get this to work.  I followed the steps here, and was still seeing problems, so I tried the steps on Ali Bastani's blog next.  I'm still seeing the same behavior:<br>When I try to create a new MVC 2 project, I see entries for ASP.Net MVC 2 Web Application and ASP.Net MVC 2 Empty Web Application, and when I choose them, they appear to start creating the files (I'm prompted if I want to create a unit test project, for instance), but then I see the following error:<br>"The project file '&lt;path to temp dir&gt;\rfhjrrfd.3ui\Temp\MvcApplication1.csproj' cannot be opened.  The project type is not supported by this installation."<br>Obviously the temp folder name is different each time.  The most recent time I saw this, I tried navigating to that location to see what, exactly, was being written there, and I was surprised to see that nothing at all was being written there.  I haven't yet gone as far as loading up any sysinternals tools to see if they can see a file error of some sort.<br>I also left a similar comment on Ali's blog.<br>Thanks for any clues you might be able to throw my way.</p>
