message: <p>Gee whiz people, sounds like somebody needs a hug. :)<br>Microsoft hires a range of people from senior level to fresh (at any age) out of college. I was merely told by the development manager that we had some junior positions opening up as part of our college/grad school recruiting efforts, so I wrote a blog post to advertise those positions.<br>If I were to hazard a guess, and this is just a guess, we already have our senior developer positions filled on the ASP.NET team, but we have a junior position opening up.<br>If you think you belong at Microsoft, take control over your career and go to <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="careers at microsoft">https://careers.microsoft.com/</a> and submit your resume. You don't need to wait for my permission to apply for a job at Microsoft (but feel free to mention me as the referrer). :)<br>There's a range of positions open at the company and if you are an experienced quality developer, I doubt a college degree is absolutely mandatory. After all, Bill Gates started the company as a Harvard drop-out.<br>But as far as the ASP.NET team is concerned, these are the only two positions currently open that I know about.</p>
