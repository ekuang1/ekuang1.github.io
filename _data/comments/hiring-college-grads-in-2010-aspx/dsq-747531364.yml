message: "<p>The thing that annoys the heck out of me is that companies won't consider people they think would be \"over-qualified\" for a job even if the person doesn't mind the discrepency.  Presumably they want a fresh-out-college grad because it's a junior position.<br>What if I've got several years of experience... but I really want to work on ASP.Net - so I'd be willing to take a junior position and a pay cut? <br>I've heard horror stories about PhD's not able to get any job because everyone dismisses them because they're over-qualified... even though they don't care and just want the job.  (I'd hate to think one would have to leave their degree(s) <em>off</em> their resume to get a job!)<br>I understand arguments about not wanting to waste time on a person who is likely to turn it down... but why not just confirm with them: \"Hey, this is a junior position, and you seem over-qualified.  You're likely not going to be interested in the responsibilities and payscale.  But if you're still interested, we'll bring you in for an interview.\"</p>"
