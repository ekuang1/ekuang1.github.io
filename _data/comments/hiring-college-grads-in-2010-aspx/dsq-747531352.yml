message: <p>I actually thought this was a little ageist.  What about being a 2010 graduate makes someone a better candidate than someone who's been our of school for a while?  Isn't age discrimination illegal?<br>Not that one is necessarily young to be a 2010 graduate, but it certainly seems as though you're looking for young candidates.<br>Bet you didn't think a job opening ppost would create so much drama, huh, Phil?</p>
