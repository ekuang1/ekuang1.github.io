message: <p>I am really disappointed to see the this post. A graduate can apply for a coding position but an undergraduate can only apply for a QA position? (not that I think QA is walk in the park)<br>What part of a graduation course enables someone to write quality code? I am a dropout and I quit college because I was way too passionate about programming. I found most of the courses way too slow and outdated for my taste. (Not to mention being stuck in a class where most students only care about landing a job rather than being passionate about the subject).<br>Please don't tell me you still believe in the old line about the difference in "designing" and *just* "programming". I care about the quality of my software just as much as a graduate (probably a lot more).<br>I don't want to start a full scale debate but I am really curious to find out what makes you think being a graduate is really a necessity for a programming position.</p>
