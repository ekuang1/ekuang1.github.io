message: "<p>Attention all (recent grad) applicants: Your new daddy Phil will not tolerate any backchat, you've been warned! Thank you Phil for sharing this aspect of your personality with all your readers and memorializing it in this blog post.<br>re: 'Lots of companies ask for recent graduates when filling positions.' Yes, and lots of companies discriminate on the basis of age too and some of them use this strategy.<br>According to your response the only people who would ever have an interest in this position are either upcoming graduates (of 4 year universities and grad programs) or obsolescent and incurious classic ASP developers who have ignored <a href=\"http://asp.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"asp.net\">asp.net</a> for the last nine years.  There are no other sorts of people who could become valuable members of the ASP.Net team.  <br>You also made the lame Senior Software Developer argument because recent grads are 'a fraction of the price'. I see, so you've not only decided to save money by shunning qualified mid-career programmers and focus on upcoming grads because they are cheaper and will work lots of overtime but you've also made the paternalistic decision for all the unemployed Sr. Devs out there that it is not in their interest to take a lower paying position. Not your decision to make! Every new hire is a risk. Again, what is the turnover rate of the <a href=\"http://asp.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"asp.net\">asp.net</a> team. What percentage of former <a href=\"http://asp.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"asp.net\">asp.net</a> members 'moved up' and are still employed by Microsoft?<br><a href=\"http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=usunemployment&amp;met=unemployment_rate&amp;tdim=true&amp;q=unemployment+rate#met=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=county:PS530250&amp;tdim=true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=usunemployment&amp;met=unemployment_rate&amp;tdim=true&amp;q=unemployment+rate#met=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=county:PS530250&amp;tdim=true\">www.google.com/publicdata</a></p>"
