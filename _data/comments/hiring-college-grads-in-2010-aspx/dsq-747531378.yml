message: <p>I agree with CS -- but from the opposite end of the spectrum.  This post smacks of blatant age discrimination. WHy would you not pitch this as 'entry level <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> hot shots' and then list a specific minimal set of skills that makes one qualified?  If anyone is suing Microsoft in an age discrimination suite you've just done them a great favor. WHy do you have no interest in opening up this position to say-- people in thier 30's who have just recently fallen in love with <a href="http://asp.net?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net?">asp.net?</a> The only criteria you've defined is age. Caution to all readers this likely means they are looking for enthusiastic and more readily exploitable people who don't have much familiarity with the workplace. WHat's the turn over rate for the <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> team anyway?</p>
