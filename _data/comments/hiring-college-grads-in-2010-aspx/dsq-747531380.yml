message: <p>Jeez!<br>Lots of companies ask for recent graduates when filling positions. What they get out of them is cheap labour, less backchat and up-to-date information and skills that some older programmers don't have. It's win-win for both company and employee - the employee is expected to move on/up and the company has (hopefully) got some great work out of them, for a fraction of the cost of a senior developer. Out of university I got a job like this, having worked as an SEO analyst straight from school before I decided to go to uni.<br>By all means, somebody who specialised in ASP for the last ten years could go for a junior post, but you'd be getting paid less than you're used to and you may be seriously out of your depth. In all honesty if you apply for a job taking a jump like that, it looks like you don't know what you're doing. Why would somebody want to take a risk on somebody that could easily leave after six months because they want to go in a different direction or don't like the current one they've tried to go down?<br>As somebody who has lived both these out, it pays to keep yourself up to date with education/courses/certification. If anything, short-term, high paid work is your best bet if you're an old timer. At least then you're moving on because the job calls for it, not because you're flaky.</p>
