message: <p>@Rahul<br>While your questions are all valid and have a basis, most often the time, it is a company policy to hire recent graduates. They usually also have internship positions for current students. It is not just because they are good or bad devs, but because they have the potential to be a good one. I don't really see anything wrong here.</p>
