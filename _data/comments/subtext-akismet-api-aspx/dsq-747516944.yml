message: <p>Phil,<br>I saw another implementation by a German developer.  Thomas had used it to write Akismet Spam Rule for our CS Alabaster pack.<br>Akismet is great but a small issue for their services can kill your blog.  One month ago they faced with some problems and we started getting over 100-200 spams everyday.<br>However, their services help alot ;-)</p>
