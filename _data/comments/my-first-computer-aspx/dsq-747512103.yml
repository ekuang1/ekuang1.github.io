message: <p>Well, my first machine was a <strong>Commodore VC-20</strong> with a nice casette tape ;-) The second was a <strong>Commodore C-128 D</strong> (yeah, the special edition with the steel case), followed by a <strong>Commodore Amiga 500</strong> witch extended memory and an external 25MB (or something like that) hard drive. As my dad had some exiting professional connections, this was one of the first Amigas here in Austria :-) I was sooo proud of it, I can tell u.<br>The rest are (mostly overclocked) <strong>AMD-driven PCs</strong> till now. "No Intel inside" since 20 years.<br>Do I have to say that I'm working as software developper since ages *LOL* ?</p>
