message: <p>The Tandy Color computer was also my first - my only Christmas gift that year (1980). That lasted about a week, long enough to find out it was no match for the Commodore 64. The TRS-80 went back to Radio Shack and what followed were many days and nights learning Commodore BASIC, typing in programs from magazines consisting of DATA statements of machine code (loaded and executed with a BASIC loader) and saving to cassette tape using "turbo loader" software to speed up load times. I saved for months and finally got the 1541 disk drive and eventually a printer (dot matrix of course!). Later came 6502 Assembly then C, using Power Assembler and Power C. And of course a few games along the way. Me and my brother's favorites were from EPYX (Summer, Winter, and World games, Championship Wrestling, Pitstop II) and Accolade (4th and Inches, Law of the West, and Hardball!). Good times!</p>
