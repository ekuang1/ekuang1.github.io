message: <p>This was my first computer <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/aquarius.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://oldcomputers.net/aquarius.html">http://oldcomputers.net/aquarius.html</a> I remember the first "out of memory error" that made me understand how little is 4Kb of ram memory (I didn't have the 16Kb expansion). Then came a commodore 64 my big love. That old times computers were less powerfull but maybe more personal than now.</p>
