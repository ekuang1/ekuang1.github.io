message: <p>My first computer was an IBM 1410 at the University of Detroit in 1966.  It had a card read/punch, printer, 4 tape drives and 80k (that's 80,000) 6-bit characters of memory.  For student programming classes, we flipped it into 1401 mode where memory was limited to 16,000 characters.  Since it only ran one program at a time, it was as good as "mine" when it was running my code.</p>
