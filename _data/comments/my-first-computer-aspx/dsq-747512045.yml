message: "<p>My first \"hand-on\" computer was a little bit more than a calculator, the HP-9810 at the high school's Electronics laboratory in 1981... Later on, the school purchased a Commodore PET 8032 and an Apple II, on these computers I started coding. As a Christmas gift, my father purchased a C=64 with floppy disk: that was amazing to me.<br>To date my daughter, as long as other \"native digital\" can hardly believe that at the times we didn't have the Internet...   <br></p>"
