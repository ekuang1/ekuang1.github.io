message: <p>That brings me back quite a while ago. If I remember correctly, 1978 was the year I bought my first computer, a Timex Sinclair 1000, ZX80, 2 Kb of RAM and one of the first incarnation of GWBasic written by you know who (GW - Gates William). I remember paying around $279.00 for a 16 Kb RAM extension module that plugged in the back and that we needed to remove once in a while in order to clean the contacts with a pen eraser. <br>My second computer was a Color Computer (CoCo). That was quite an update from my first one. For this second one, I bought 2 floppy readers that I connected with a special extension module. The floppy readers were able to use single sided 180Kb 5 1/4 disk in which I punched a second hole on the opposite side of the first one in order to store data on the opposite side.<br>After that, I bought one of the first PC, 8088, 512 Kb RAM, dual 360Kb floppies equipped with DOS 1.x (as I remember). I'm a programmer since then and I never lost the habit of writing efficient code that uses as little resources as possible.</p>
