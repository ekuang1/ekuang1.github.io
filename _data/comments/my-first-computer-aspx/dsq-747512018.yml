message: <p>This was my family's first computer.  My dad chose it because he wrote computer programs and for him this was the purist way to do it at home.  Because my sister and I complained all the time, he purchased TI Logo, but it was nothing compared to the Apple IIe version.  Some things I remember:<br><br>1.  Dad programmed games for us and saved them to tape.  No disk drive for us, we had a Radio Shack tape recorder that could record his programs.  Loading my favorite game, Jungle Jim (a poor knockoff of Pitfall programmed in TI Extended Basic) took nearly 15 minutes to load.  And we get mad now when a webpage takes more than a second to load.<br><br>2.  Parsec was the best game available on the TI.  It was like Wing Commander for the Flock of Seagulls.<br><br>3.  The TI joystick was terrible.  IT would often stick so we had to pause the game to pull out the connector and blow on the interface.  My sister learned to play Munch Man (Pac Man, except you shat out a chain to fill in the maze instead of eating power pellets) by only turning left since our joystick often didn't go right.<br><br>4.  We bought a 13 inch color portable TV to use as a monitor which I suppose was overkill becaise the TI only supported 16 colors.<br><br>5.  We entered a whole new world of computing when we bought the 32k memory expansion card.  Sweet!<br><br>6.  One thing people oftern forget, the TI was portable.  You could plug it into any TV and it only weighed about 8 pounds.  It was just a pain carrying the tape recorder around.<br><br>7.  We replaced the TI with a 25 Mhz 386 SX with 1 mb of RAM and a 40 mb harddrive.  My dad proudly said, "Son, this is more storage space then you'll ever need!"  Ahh, the good old days!</p>
