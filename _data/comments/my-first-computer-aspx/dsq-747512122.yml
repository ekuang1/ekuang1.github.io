message: <p>My first system was a Digital Group Z-80 with 34k of RAM, 2 Phi-Deck tape drives (each tape could hold about 300kb and worked like a slow floppy disk) Later I added 2 x 512k Double Density 8" Floppy drives. Used a black and white monitor. 16 x 64 character display. <br>The original OS and BASIC were very similar to North Star's OS and BASIC.  When I added the 8" floppy drives, I had also bought the OASIS operating system and OASIS Business BASIC and Z-80 Macro Assembler.  OASIS is still around today, it's now called THEOS.<br>Imagine an OS with built in ISAM files! It was a cool system that was good for a couple of years till a power supply short fried it.</p>
