message: <p>My first computer was a TRS80 model one 4k. That was  in 1978. By 79 I was in buiness selling memory and parts for the machine. Tried the first MaC and quickly sold it. I hated it. About 2 years a go I had a option to purchase a new MAC and found it is still as lame as the first. I still work in the industry as a programmer but lately I am loing interst in what I do. Shame. It is almost a life style but I will retire next year and bid goodbye to it all.</p>
