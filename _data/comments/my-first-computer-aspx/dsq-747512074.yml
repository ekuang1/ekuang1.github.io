message: <p>I had to build my first computer - for $500 I got a big printed circuitboard, a big bag of parts and assembly instructions. The end result was a Processor Technology SOL20 computer running off of 2 motorcycle batteries until I was able to build a case for it.<br>It was the grandfather of the all-in-one computers after which came the PET and TRS80 systems.<br>Of course, I had to have storage, so I paid $450 for a Shugart 5.25" single-sided single density hard sectored floppy drive with the amazingly large storage capacity of 80KB (Formated).<br>Yes!! Those were the days......</p>
