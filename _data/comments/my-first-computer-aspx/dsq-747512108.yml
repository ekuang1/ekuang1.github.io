message: <p>My first computer was a Z80 development kit which I used to program in machine code. Not assembler but hex digits. Programs could be saved to a tape recorder but were much safer burned to EPROM. I eventually interfaced an ASCII keyboard and a Monitor then wrote a small basic like interpreter entirely in machine code.<br></p>
