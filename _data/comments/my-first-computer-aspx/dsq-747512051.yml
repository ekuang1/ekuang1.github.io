message: "<p>Newbear 77-68: a kit computer based on the motorola 6800 with 256 bytes of RAM (yes bytes, not even kilobytes).<br>I/O was 2 rows of 8 switches, one row for the address and one for the data input, and a row of 8 leds for data out, with a loudspeake across one of the LEDs for audio out. Amazing what could be done with such a set-up. <br>Later I took the memory up to 16 k, added a cassette recorder for program storage and then added a Creed teleprinter for IO (fiddling those switches got a bit tedious). Next steps included a 5 1/4\" floppy drive and an adapted B&amp;W television with a Newbear graphics card, and a digital keyboard. <br>It's all still gathering dust in the attic.<br></p>"
