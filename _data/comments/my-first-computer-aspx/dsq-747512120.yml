message: <p>I built my first computer using the 8080 chip that I bought from Radio Shack in about 1977.  It had a bootstrap ROM that was made on a separate board using 1N914 diodes that allowed me to enter programs with 8 toggle switches.  The readout was 8 LED's.<br>After that I bought a COCO with 4K memory, then a TI99, TRS80 Model I, COCO II, COCO III...  Then I sold or gave them away and got out of it until about 1995 when I was given an IBM clone with 20M hard drive running Windows 3.1<br>I've had several since then.</p>
