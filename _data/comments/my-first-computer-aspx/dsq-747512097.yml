message: <p>TI-99/4A - received for Xmas as a joint gift for my brother and I in 1982 or 1983 if I recall.  By the end of the week I had taught myself TI BASIC by going through the books that came with the machine.<br>Years later I picked up an Atari 65XE, followed by an Atari 520STFM, then an Atari 1040 STE (which I upgraded to a whopping 2 Megabytes).  Still have the STE in my storage locker, but need to sell it soon as I am out of space. :(</p>
