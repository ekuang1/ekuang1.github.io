message: <p>I must be the oldest programmer out there, my first computer was an analog computer that I built for a high school science fair project in 1962.  It could multiply numbers faster than my slide rule.  My first digital computer was a KIM-1 which had a hexadecimal keypad and seven segment display.  Programming was in machine code and, if I remember right, 2K of memory. From these humble beginnings to 25 years as a process control programmer. I am still amazed whenever I use an 8GB memory stick.</p>
