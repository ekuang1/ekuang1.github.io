message: <p>My first computer was an IBM 360/50, with 256KB of memory, and about 60MB in on-line disc space and 6 tape drives. It filled a fairly large room in the basement of the Theatre Arts Annex at Dalhousie University. I was 15 at the time, and had to learn to use a Model 029 keypunch so that I could get my programs into a form that the system could read. My first programming language was FORTRAN IV.<br>In my final year at high school, I used a PDP-8/L (with FOCAL) and an HP 2110 (with BASIC).<br></p>
