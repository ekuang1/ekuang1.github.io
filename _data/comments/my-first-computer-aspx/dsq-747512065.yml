message: <p>My first computer was built from a kit in 1978. My second computer was a TI99/4. That led to becoming the Senior Technical Editor at 99'er magazine, and then Home Computer Magazine. I wrote a lot of the programs people typed into those little boxes every month. I got a chance to play with the PCjr a few months before it was release down at IBM - Boca Raton, FL.</p>
