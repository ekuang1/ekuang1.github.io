message: <p>My first computer was an Ohio Scientific with 4k of memory and an upgrade of 4k for a total of 8k. My next one was the Timex Sinclair and at that point I knew I needed more. So I bought a bare board and populated it with all the chips. It was a Xerox 820 model with 2 floppy drives capable of storing 80k on each floppy. I learned a lot from this computer and interfaced it to all kinds of hardware that I built from scratch. It was my first CPM OS. The next computer was my Bondwell portable computer. Weighed about 20 pounds in a suitcase style setup. It also ran CPM. This was all in the late '70's before the IBM pc's made it to market and finally caught my eye. Those were the days.</p>
