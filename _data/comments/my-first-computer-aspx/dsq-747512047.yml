message: "<p>Started with a TRS-80 Model I at school and soon with a 16k CoCo 1 (while learning Motorola 68xx programming). Honed my skills on those until I was able to purchase my own, the CoCo's little brother: the MC-10; by the mid 80's I had added a 64k CoCo. Did a minor stint with the TI99/4A and the VIC20 but the 6809 uP had my soul already; tried the IBM PC only to get back to a CoCo 3. Still have all the noted machines setup and running (plus other additions over the years: C64, ST1040, VIC20, Mac SE, Apple IIc...)</p>"
