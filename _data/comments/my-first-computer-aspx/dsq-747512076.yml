message: <p>My first computer was a Commodore 64.  I was lucky that my parents bought me a 1541 floppy drive to go with it, since many of my friends were stuck loading from cassette tape (the game "Frogger" took 6 minutes to load!).  I still have it, as well as a collection of other Commodore models that I have collected over the years, with my thousands of 5.25" floppy disks that still work.  I thought the manufacturers said that they would only last 10 years?!?<br>The really great thing that I remember most about Commodore computers was the abundance of "Public Domain" software and source code released by the many Commodore user groups.  Long before "Open Source" came into existence, Commodore was promoting sharing of knowledge and code to help further computer programming interest.  I bet that a lot of current software patents could be invalidated by resurrecting this old PD software as evidence of prior art.<br>I was always amazed at how fast and responsive those 1 MHz computers were.  When confined by 48K usable RAM, assembly language was the way to go.  Many applications and games used the BASIC interpreter for menus and simple user interfaces, and left ML to do the hard work behind the scenes.  It was almost like magic until I learned 6510 ML.  I heavily used the "Commodore Assembler Development System" and the much better "Merlin Macro Assembler" which had an interlaced 80-column mode!  My parents bought for me, as a gift, the Abacus "Super C++" and "Super Pascal" compilers, but they were too slow to consider using for anything but playing around with the languages, so I stuck with the BASIC v2/6510 ML combo for most of my development.<br>I can't imagine what PCs would run like if everything was in raw, optimized ML.<br>I guess it's the old trade-off of execution speed vs. development speed, and the developers won when they could simply require that their users throw hardware at the problem.<br>-Derek</p>
