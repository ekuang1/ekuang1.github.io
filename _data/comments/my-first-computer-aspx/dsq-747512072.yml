message: <p>Wang 2200 T in 1974.  It wasn't mine personally, but they needed someone to program it and they came to RIT to recruit a Co-Op student who could spell "Micro-computer" and "Basic" and could type. I lived on that box for a year. 48K Basic in the ROM, 8K user memory (later upgraded to 16K), cassette tape, 3MB hard drive (1.5MB removable cartridge, 1.5MB non-removable).  They later started using Datapoint 1100 and 2200 series machines, so I added Databus to my language set. The engineers got dial-up access for developing APL programs, and I had 2 semesters of APL so that came into my universe.  In 1979 I got a job in Miami doing APL development, both TSO and on the neat little IBM 5100 series machines.  The 70's were kind to me....</p>
