message: <p>My first computer was a Commodore VIC 20 (1985).  My friends all had 64's, which made mine look like a real turd.  I had a cassette drive, color tv monitor, and 1 game cartridge--Mission:Impossible.  I never solved the game.  I could get all the way through it to the last scene with the bomb, and no matter what combination I tried, it always blew up!!  I sort of miss those "text-only" games.  You really had to concentrate and take good notes.  Since then I've picked up an Amiga 500, Amiga 2000 (sucked worse than the 500) and a Commodore Colt from thrift stores.  The Commodore's graphics subsystem was FAR superior to the IBM.  I don't know what happened there.  I still have the monitor.</p>
