message: <p>My very first computer was a 3 bit plastic "toy" that I got when I was about 10 around 1964. It was amazing which is why I am relunctant to call it a toy. It was a mechanical wonder.<br>It was about 6 inches high, 3 inches deep and 12 inches long.<br>It had 3 horizontal sliders (3 inches deep by 12 inches long) each with a "0-1" sticker on the end which were displayed through a slot at the end of the "computer". So if the slider was in one position you would see "0" and in the other "1". Thus the 3 sliders made up the three bits.<br>You programmed the computer by placing small tubes over pegs that ran down the edge of the slider. These pegs were paired with one labeled "set" and the other "reset" (if my memory serves me right). In front of the pegs were spring loaded rods running vertically. <br>In addition to the 3 "data" sliders there were 2 "clock" sliders that were mechnically connected to each other. One of these you pushed in and pulled out for one clock cycle. The second "clock" slider moved in the opposite direction. As the "clock" slider was moved in and out by hand, the rods were pulled away from the "data" sliders, the "data" sliders could move and then the rods were returned. If a peg was there, the rods were stopped but if no peg was there, the spring loaded rod was able to travel further.<br>Attached to the rods were short connectors that travelled perpendicular to the main sliders and connected to other rods on the back. Thus when the rods on the fron were stopped, the rod on the back was in and when the rod on the front was in, the rod on the back was out. The rods on the back touched other pegs on the sliders and when you "clocked" it was these back pegs that pushed the slider left or right.<br>Anyway, it was able to count up and down and play the game of "Nim". <br>Wish I had a picture to show you since I know no one can figure out what it looks like from my description.</p>
