I paid extra for CP/M. It had some games like "space raiders", my favoure game was "D Day" where you defended the beaches; rather a Japanese perspective!<br>See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ</a></p>'
