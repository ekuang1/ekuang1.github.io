message: <p>First was a C=64 with a brown expernal floppy disk (5 1/4 ") reader and the more common tape reader, some day after buying the C=64 I bought a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, since a friend of mine has one and he would have shared the C16 tapes... ;-) I still remember some of the exadecimal codes for the equivalent assembly lanuage instructions (remember LDA,LDX,LDY,BCC,... and READ-DATA, PEEK and POKE? And the Turbo loader - maybe Rambo was one of the first games having the turbo loader...)<br>After that a Sinclair QL (resold some day after I bought...), an Amiga 500 (equipped with a 20MB - 20 Mega Bytes - external HD!!!), an Amiga 1200, an Amiga 4000/030, a Macintosh 5200, a Compaq Pentium 166, a Macintosh 6300, A Packard Bell PIII 650, a PowerPC G3 (gray) an IBM ThinkPad R50e, an IBM ThinkPad R500 (the last one). Some year ago, My nostalgia push me to buy an old Macintosh Classic too...<br>I still miss my Amiga 4000/030 (Nebulus Game and Tower of Babel, real games I mean! Not like the ones my kids are playing today!...)<br>Best regards to all.</p>
