message: <p>My first computer, actually owned by my employer, was an IBM 1800 with 32K 16-bit words of memory. Its console was a teletype keyboard/typewriter with paper tape reader. It had an 80-column punched-card reader and a 5MB disk cartridge. Very advanced system for its time (1969). We wrote software in assembly language that was compiled and linked into the O/S (because it ran as an interrupt service routine) that controlled a conveyor system used to sort and batch axles in a Chevrolet axle plant in Buffalo, NY. I think the purchase price of this system was somewhere in the $25K range.<br>My first home computer (1990) was an Atari 1040. The 40MB hard drive I bought for it set me back $475! My first PC came along in 1992 when top-of-the-curve systems ran about $2500.<br></p>
