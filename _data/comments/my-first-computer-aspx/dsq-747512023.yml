message: <p>First computer I ownded was a Timex Sinclair 2068. I went from TRASH-80 (4K) to Sinclair ZX-81 to ZX-Spectrum to BBC Model B before my parents bought me the T/S 2068. My first hardware mod - I put a Spectrum ROM in the 2068! I was another 6 years before I got a "real" pc - A Bleading Edge with a dedicated monitor and two floppies! Of course, I swapped the 8088 with an NEC V-20. It had 512K, a 1200bps modem, and ran MS-DOS!</p>
