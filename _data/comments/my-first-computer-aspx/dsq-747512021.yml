message: <p>Wow! Happy, frustrating days! I initially was taught on one of these. Christ they were slow. I was taught by a really BORING computer teacher with brown socks, brown sandals, brown beard and boring brown car.  All I can remember was how slow and complicated it was just to start writing a document. But I persevered despite the fact he kept talking gobbledegook and sending us home with big handouts covered in code commands in 6 point type.<br><br><br><br>That was in 1985.  By 1986 (I think!) I discovered Apple Mac and I never looked back.  In fact, I am using one now.</p>
