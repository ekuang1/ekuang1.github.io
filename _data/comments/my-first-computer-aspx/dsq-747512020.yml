message: <p>I also had a CoCo for first computer at home. Before that I had to put the phone receiver into a portable coupler and dial into local university's computers.<br><br><br><br>Those cartridges were a life saver so did not have to wait to load stuff from CASSETTE! We had a subscription to some "magazine" that sent us a new cassette each month with a bunch of programs on it. It was fun having to Fast Forward to a certain counter to get to a specific program to load.</p>
