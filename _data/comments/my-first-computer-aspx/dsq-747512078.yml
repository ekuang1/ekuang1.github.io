message: <p>My first computer was a 4K TRS-80 Model I which I inherited from my brother when I was 16.  A lot of people refer to the TRS-80 as the trash-80, but for me I used it to write and sell some games with a friend of mine and used that money to fully fund going to college...so trash or not, it was a good machine to me.</p>
