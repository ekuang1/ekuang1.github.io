message: <p>I'm not convinced that this is a good solution to comment spam.  <br><br><br><br>- I don't think it'll stop the spammers.  It requires work to see whether or not your links are using rel="nofollow" -- and there's no reason NOT to spam anyway, on the off chance that people will click thru, pagerank or no.  This seems like a no-brainer to me.<br><br><br><br>- I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to remove the pagerank rewards for links that are _not_ spam.  I want to reward people who post related and constructive links to my blog, or, at least, reward the owners of the sites.<br><br><br><br>- I think that human interactive tests are a better guarantee against comment spam.<br><br><br><br>- Comment moderation is a great option for popular sites.  Low scores hit the trash heap.</p>
