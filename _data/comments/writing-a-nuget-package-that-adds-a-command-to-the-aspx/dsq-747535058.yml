message: <p>One thing I've noticed is that development / testing of your powershell scripts is easier if you just put them straight into the init.ps1 instead of going the module route.<br>The commands i am adding use the $installPath and $toolsPath variables so this lets them access it easier. Also i have a hard time getting it to pick up my changes when i use modules, even if i use Remove-Module i still sometimes need to completely restart VS to get them noticed.</p>
