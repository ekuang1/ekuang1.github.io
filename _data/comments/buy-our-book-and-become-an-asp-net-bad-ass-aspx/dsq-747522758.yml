message: <p><em>"The target audience for the book is the intermediate developer..."</em><br>I purchased a copy! Haack as well as the other authors have done so much for the community. I've learned a lot from you guys. The least I could do is buy the book. I could only purchase once copy though... "intermediate developer" salary ;)<br>P.S. Can't wait for the MVC Framework!</p>
