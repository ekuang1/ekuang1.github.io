message: <p>@Travis You're still going to buy one, right? ;)<br>You make a good point, but from my experience, it takes at least a year or more after release for the next version of ASP.NET to start getting adoption at the workplace for most developers. Some devs are lucky and get to deploy the latest greatest bits, but by and large, I think most ASP.NET devs will be working on ASP.NET 2.0 for the next year.<br>Secondly, the book is meant to distill wisdom, tips, solutions based on real world experience. The type of things us authors have run into on real projects with real clients. That sort of knowledge would be hard to put in a book for ASP.NET 3.5 since it's not even release technology and not many out there have long running experience with it.<br>Unfortunately, people won't see my explanation on the cover of the book. They'll see "2.0" and I hope it doesn't dissuade anyone.</p>
