message: <p>I think this is good news and it's added to my Amazon wishlist. However what I like to see is a book which covers ASP.NET 2.0 development with MVC. Or is there enough content for a book on this topic ?<br>I think that MVC is a really important thing to learn (not to mention other patterns) and there is already some content available on the web. But so far no books of this topic for(ASP).NET are written (or are there any ?)</p>
