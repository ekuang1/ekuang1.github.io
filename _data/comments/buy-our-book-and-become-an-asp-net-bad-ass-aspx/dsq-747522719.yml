message: <p>I've heard about a couple of new books on 2.0 in the past week...  With VS2008 right around the corner...  why would anyone release a book so late in the product cycle?<br>Please don't get me wrong... I'm sure it's a GREAT book, and I do realize that most all of it will still be pertinent in the 3.x world, but...  <br>It seems to me that these books stand a high chance of being ignored in favor of books with a big "3.0" stamp on the cover.<br></p>
