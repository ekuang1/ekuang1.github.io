message: "<p>@Travis: ASP.NET in the 3.5 version of the framework is not so different from the 2.0 version.<br>The new features are Ajax and all compiler sugar things needed for Linq, but nothing really new for ASP.NET. And then, I know of people still using ASP 1.1, so, since the 2008 series will be released next Spring, probably developers will need tips on 2.0 still for a long time. And probably, marketing now, something about the 3.5 will have the opposite effect: nobody will buy it since it's based on pre-release software.<br>@Phil: I want one signed by you and Jeff, and copy of your new business card @ MS :)</p>"
