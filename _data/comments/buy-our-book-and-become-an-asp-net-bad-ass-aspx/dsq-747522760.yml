message: <p>I will likely purchase it, even if just to say thanks for all the great content on your blog... but like someone else already mentioned..  I've heard that MS is working on a new MV* pattern for ASP.NET and some blogger guy joined up to work on that project.<br>I might wait and see if that needs a book.  Because you know... even if it doesn't someone will write one.<br></p>
