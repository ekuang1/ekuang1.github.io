message: <p>Switching Solomon for Merrell won't make a blind bit of difference.  Your soles have separated due to deterioration in the rubber.  I've seen this with people who only take their boots out once or twice a season.  Left alone the rubber becomes brittle and you get the effect you've had there.  Try not to let them get too dry in-between trips out and if you can, wear them a couple of days a month into work just to give them a bit of flex.<br>Love your boots and your boots will love you.</p>
