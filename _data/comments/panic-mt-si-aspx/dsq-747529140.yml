message: <p>@Gabriel there's a difference between too much confidence and healthy respect, I agree. But there's also a difference between a healthy respect and fear. I don't think you want to climb a mountain if you don't think you can. You have to have a bit of confidence that you can do it, but not too much confidence.<br>@Kian, good tip! Thanks!</p>
