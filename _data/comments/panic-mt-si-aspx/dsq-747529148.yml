message: <p>Wow, sounds like Eilon came prepared!  My dad is a real hiking buff and he convinced me early on that good running shoes (with good tread) are the best thing to hike in (regardless of terrain).  I have been on a number of fairly extensive hikes, and that bit of advise has yet to fail me (I've never had my shoes fall apart, regardless of age), so you may consider trying out some New Balance or Saucony running shoes on your next hike.  They're a simpler shape, so there's less to go wrong (fall apart), and they don't give your ankles the "false confidence" that my dad is convinced is responsible for the majority of sprained ankles on hikes.  I also think the ankle support of a high-top boot is over-rated, and I find that the low-top of a running shoe makes me much more agile when navigating rocky trails.  (Let your ankles do what they're designed to do!)<br>Happy Hiking!<br>Pat</p>
