message: "<p>You've lived my nightmare: shoe failure in the field.  I've had the same kind of blowouts with Merrells, but usually after more than a few years.  I think it's age more than mileage--as another commenter pointed out, the \"rubber\" (or whatever it is these days) just breaks down--and so I've gotten in the habit of owning fewer pairs while putting more miles on them.  Tread permitting, I replace boots after two years to three and sandals every year (because the straps separate from the sole).  If you can get away with it at work, wear your hikers daily as it keeps them comfortable and makes it a lot easier to gauge the true condition of the shoe by the tread wear.  In fact, gym shoes are the same way: they never \"wear out\" tread-wise, but you're killing your feet after the first couple of years.  Carrying Tevas as a backup (and for stream crossing) is extravagant, but great insurance.  Owning fewer boots is also a good environmental strategy, so if you end up with ones you can't trust, donate them or use them for household chores (especially painting!).</p>"
