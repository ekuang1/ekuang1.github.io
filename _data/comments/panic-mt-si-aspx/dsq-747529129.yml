message: <p><strong>I</strong> bring duct tape along on a hike! A lot of hiking guides recommend bringing duct tape since you can repair leaks, fix shoes (!), mend a backpack, or even make lashing out of it. I was carrying about 25lbs of gear in my pack to prep for a possible future backpacking trip where we'd have to carry a lot more gear.<br>Even though Phil won $20 from me in dares and bets, he owes me new sandals, a roll of duct tape, and some first aid bits :)</p>
