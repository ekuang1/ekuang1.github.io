message: <p>It's an interesting idea.<br>I have taken an opposite way and turnned into a framework you might find interesting.<br><a href="https://github.com/cinchcast/Roque" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/cinchcast/Roque">https://github.com/cinchcast/Roque</a><br>the idea is use common C# methods or events to send a job into a Redis list (used as a queue), and then have multiple windows services pulling jobs from each queue, each job ends up in calling the same method or event using reflection.<br>To get scheduling you can write a console app (called on schedule) and there call a method (or raise an event) to get the same effect.</p>
