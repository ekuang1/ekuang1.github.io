message: <p>Had to work on something similar, but ended up using "low" level threads and managing the queue manually. The main reason, from what I remember, was to be able to use Monitor.Pulse and Monitor.Wait to allow the threads to sleep and for throttling. <br>Too bad RegisterObject requires full trust. A workaround is to ping yourself every so often to make sure the pool doesn't shut down.</p>
