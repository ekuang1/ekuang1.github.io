message: <p>I just watched the "What's new in ASP.NET MVC2" webcast. I am excited about the new stuff, especially the template helpers. I've used Dynamic Data extensively and I am glad to see that the scaffolding technology is included with MVC now. Template helpers make it very easy to build CRUD forms without having to write the same code again &amp; again. Hooray, productivity!</p>
