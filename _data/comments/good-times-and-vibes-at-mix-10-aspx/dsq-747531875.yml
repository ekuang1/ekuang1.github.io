message: <p>Hey Phil, <br>It was nice to meet you in person again at MIX. (I had met you at PDC a couple years ago).  I enjoyed both your sessions.  When stuff goes wrong it gives everyone a chance to see how to debug problems :)<br>This was my first trip to MIX, and I really enjoyed meeting people. I'm glad to see Microsoft bringing in great outside developers like John Resig, Douglas Crockford, Molly Holzschlag, Jonathan Snook, and others.</p>
