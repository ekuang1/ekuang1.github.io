message: "<p>You can't mechanize any human interactions, no matter what you do. When I sit with a new client, going over their \"detailed\" (read: Excel Spreadsheet) first-pass requirements, I usually spend more time thinking about them and what they want, who they are, what makes them tick. I like to crawl inside my client's head so I can see through the market-speak and figure out how I can make them look good. This works pretty well for me and (no kidding) many clients become good friends! <br>I use the Brat method myself: all software I work on is a bratty kid whom I have to raise from conception through adolescence. It's a constant shift of priorities while maintaining a steady hand. Some spanking here, hugging there, complete lack of sleep early on.<br>Now if only Agile Parenting was in vogue, I might get some sleep!</p>"
