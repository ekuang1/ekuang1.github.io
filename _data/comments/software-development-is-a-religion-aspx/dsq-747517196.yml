message: <p>Agile Parenting is the hot new craze.  <br>First, if at all possible, you pair parent.  When the kid is young, you keep the iterations short, for example, waking up every two to three hours to feed.<br>Then you spend time gathering requirements from a client who makes very little sense (Hint, the kid is probably hungry or soiled).<br>Or you can do the waterfall approach, 18 years of up front design and then send them off on their own.</p>
