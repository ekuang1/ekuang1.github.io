message: <p>I feel very strongly that the comments link should *not* be at the top of the post. (AK is another blog which does this)<br>How can I know if I want to comment, or read the comments, when I haven't even read the body of the fricking post yet?<br>And then when I read the post and decide the topic is interesting to me, I have to eyeball up to the header to get to the comments? That doesn't make sense either.<br>Don't Make Me Think, man!<br>(FYI, I think this might also apply to permalink, print, etc, but I rarely use those)</p>
