message: <p>I'm definitely anal about my source code - everything from C# all the way through to T-SQL. I also tend to spend a lot of time on project set up - creating relevant namespaces and class names etc - so much so that I probably spend 50% of my time refactoring as requirements change!<br>It really makes a difference when you come back to an app 6 months later when the client wants some changes :)</p>
