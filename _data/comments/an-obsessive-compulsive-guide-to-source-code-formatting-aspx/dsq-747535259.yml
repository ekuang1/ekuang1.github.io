message: <p>Nice to see you writing on this. I had a post about it and how to implement a VS add-in back in 2008:<br><a href="http://www.nayyeri.net/simpler-code-addin-for-visual-studio-2008" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nayyeri.net/simpler-code-addin-for-visual-studio-2008">www.nayyeri.net</a><br>I really hate to open a code that has formatting issues. I'd like to see the code in the standard formatting done by VS.</p>
