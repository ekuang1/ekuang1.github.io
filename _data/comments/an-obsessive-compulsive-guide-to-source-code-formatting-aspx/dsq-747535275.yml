message: <p>I would say that the vast majority of developers don't care about their source code formatting. I don't understand it myself as I don't know how they can keep a clear map of the code in their heads when its so messy. I guess a lot of developers are just 'programming by coincidence'.<br>You made some interesting points in this, I think my main take away was that I really need to learn some basic powershell commands :)<br>I am really surprised that anyone cares about the remove and sort of using statements. They seem like one of the most pointless things in the world to me? <br>I don't really see any point in them when visual studio is clever enough to resolve a statement I type and give me the option to insert the using statement then can't it just figure it out itself and stop wasting everyone's time with usings? The only time I see a using statement being of any use is to clarify in the odd situation that two names conflict. Maybe im oversimplifying the problem a bit but surely this is something that should be automated to some level?</p>
