message: <p>I love <a href="http://www.narrange.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.narrange.net/">NArrange</a>, is very useful to reorganize code, it helps to order alphabetically all methods, properties, fields, etc., and surrounds them with regions, and is opern source; another tool I used all the time is <a href="http://submain.com/products/ghostdoc.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://submain.com/products/ghostdoc.aspx">GhostDoc</a>, not open source but free, it is very useful to document all your code and is all automated and well formatted; and I use also <a href="http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis">StyleCop</a>, it doesn't do anything for me but tells me what I did wrong so I get it right. All of them are essential for me.</p>
