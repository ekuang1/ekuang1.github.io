message: <p>If you want tidy code but don't want to do all the work, a VS add-in worth a look is <a href="http://www.atomineerutils.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.atomineerutils.com/">AtomineerUtils Pro Documentation</a>. This is similar to GhostDoc, only much more powerful as it instantly creates/updates documentation comments for C#, VB, C++, C++/CLI, C, or Java code, in any of DocXML, Doxygen, Qt or JavaDoc formats. The comment style is extremely configurable, and it offers many time-saving formatting features like word wrapping, allowing us to easily achieve perfect docs so we can focus the power of our OCDs on the code itself :-)<br></p>
