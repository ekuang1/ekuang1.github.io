I had a box with them back in the day (2001?) and had the distinction of the most expensive dedicated server.<br>Me, I run my stuff on a Gameboy. Not really. I actually got lucky when I ordered a \"new\" box from The Planet, which is now SoftLayer. They didn't have what I ordered available for provision, so they bumped me up to some insane quad-core Xeon thing with 4 gigs of RAM. Drives are just cheap IDE, C: with the site files and OS, SQL on D:. Real-time data backup isn't that important, so I push a backup nightly to S3. For the half-million page views a month, the whole thing is total overkill.</p>"
