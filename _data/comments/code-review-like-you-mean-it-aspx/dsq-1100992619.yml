message: <p>Totally agree with the vast majority of everything in this. Brilliant as always.</p><p>Slightly off topic, but is there a reason GitHub doesn't display a commit's status on the actual commit page (eg. <a href="http://github.com/:owner/:repo/commit/:sha)?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="github.com/:owner/:repo/commit/:sha)?">github.com/:owner/:repo/com...</a> I feel like it'd be an incredibly helpful thing to have.</p>
