message: <p>The problem is not whether hosting proiders offer ASP.NET 3.5 - most do.  But, and this is important, usually only for new accounts.  If you are on a box with ASP.NET 2 installed and it is full, then you will likely need to get your site moved to a new box to get 3.5 - they won't upgrade a full server box.</p>
