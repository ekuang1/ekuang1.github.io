message: <p>Why don't you dump it and start from scratch. <br>SubText is so over-engineered. I looked through the source code and so many developers in bits and pieces here and there have turned the code base into Spaghetti code. <br>How do you guys even manage to keep the releases in control ? something like this would drive me (and most real developers) mad !</p>
