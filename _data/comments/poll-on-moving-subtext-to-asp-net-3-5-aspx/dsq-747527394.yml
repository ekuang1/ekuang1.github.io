message: "<p>I <strong><u>Think</u></strong> ill be able to get up and running with 3.5, at least my hosting provider sells the web hotel I am registered with as having support for: \"ASP.NET 3.5 (medium trust)\", currently my config won't let me choose it though, but it's properly just a request I need to make.<br>I Would really like to hear about the real benefits of moving up... If there's no fundamental benefits, then I would not let all those stuck on 2.0 down. (MVC already seems to be something you are waiting for v3 with so).<br></p>"
