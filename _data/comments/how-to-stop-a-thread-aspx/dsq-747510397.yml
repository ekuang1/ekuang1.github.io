message: <p>I have an array of threads working on some task... and I wan to end any thread if it's taking time to execute... so what I did was using a Timer and it's event.. called Thread.Abort() on threads taking more time..but as u mention, with the Abort()..s  unexpected behavior.. it's hard to expect what I want to succeed. Works most of the time.. can't rely this. Any ideas.<br>the way proposed here seems not applicable here for me bcoz the specific thread is working on a time taking method call and no way to repeatedly check a variable to end the thread itself</p>
