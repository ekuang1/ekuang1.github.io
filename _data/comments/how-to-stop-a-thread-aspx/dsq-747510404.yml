message: <p>tqnga, use the method also known as a sync lock example here:<br>            SyncLock readThread<br>                readThread.Abort()<br>                readThread = Nothing<br>            End SyncLock<br>read what a synclock does, it stops other threads from running so a thread can be safely aborted, however, you only abort threads outside of the main loop, so say for instance i made a quick module for an example:<br><br>Module ThreadExample<br>    Dim Stopper As Boolean = True 'stops thread safely then proceeds<br>    Public I As New System.Threading.Thread(AddressOf RunThread)<br>    Public Sub BeginThread() 'Begins The Thread<br>        I.IsBackground = True 'people say it saves ram but idk<br>        I.Start()<br>    End Sub<br>    Public Sub RunThread()<br>        While Stopper<br>            'do what ever you want in this thread.<br>            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000) 'might be useful for you it helps reduce CPU Usage<br>        End While<br>        Try<br>            SyncLock I 'ensures all other threads running stop<br>                I.Abort()<br>            End SyncLock<br>        Catch ex As Threading.ThreadAbortException<br>            MessageBox.Show(ex.ToString) 'I don't understand why this completely is an error, its more saying that it stopped safely.<br>        End Try<br>    End Sub<br>    Sub StopThread() 'this method stops the thread and makes the loop quit<br>        Stopper = False 'ensures that the loop will eventually stop<br>    End Sub<br>End Module</p>
