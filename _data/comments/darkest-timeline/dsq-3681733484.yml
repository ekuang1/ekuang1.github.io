message: <p>Thanks for sharing Phil. These kinds of things are tough and taboo to talk about. I have someone close in my family that suffers from mental illness. I’ll say the medical industry at large is not prepared for it either. The way this person was over medicated, marginalized and “red flagged” by her psychiatrist was unbelievable.</p>
