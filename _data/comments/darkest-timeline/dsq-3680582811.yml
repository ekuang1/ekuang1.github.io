message: <p>Thank you for writing this. Many years ago my wife struggled with her own stigmatized and poorly understood mental health issue (not depression, but I'll omit details for her privacy). It wasn't until we found an online community with other people going through the same thing that she was able to see it wasn't just her and start the process of recovery. I'm am positive this post and others like it help people.</p>
