message: <p>Phil,</p><p>As a longtime reader of your blog, I always finish one of your posts learning something new. It's usually about Software Engineering and Leadership but today it was something new and unexpected.</p><p>Thank you for sharing with us something so deeply personal. I'm grateful and definitely learned something new about depression and mental illness that will help me if one of my loved ones finds themselves in a similar experience.</p><p>Thank you!</p>
