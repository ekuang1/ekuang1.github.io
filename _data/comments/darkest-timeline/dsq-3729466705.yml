message: <p>Thanks for sharing Phil. Something I rarely talk about,  but earlier in life I suffered from extreme depression, suicidal thoughts, and attempts. This lasted from age 10 to my early twenties. Fortunately I was able to call out (several times) and my family was there to support me to get help before it was too late. Since climbing out of that dark place I have been fortunate to never going back to as low of a state, but every once in a while I have my moments.</p><p>If I ever get back there, I am committed to reach out. One thing that helps me now is I just let myself have a really bad day and I tell myself before I go to bed, tomorrow it will be better.  Many times I find that I wake up and it is! If not, I may keep saying this for days, or longer. I know one day things will return to normalcy because I have 46 years where that cycle has played over and over.</p><p>I also make sure to always think about the people around me that will be affected and heartbroken, especially my daughter. Having witnessed my niece growing up without a father recently (my brother died unexpectedly a few years ago, which brought me to a dark place) has really helped with my perspective.</p><p>Lastly my belief in my creator (personal choice) and that I was put here for a reason  also has helped in my darkest moments.</p><p>I have also had struggles with other family members suffering from depression including those very close to me, such as my own daughter a few years ago. We heard similar kind of talk. When that happened we just dropped everything to make sure we showered her with support and love, and we found her some professional help. I am also thankful that we all pulled through.</p><p>Thanks for sharing your familyâ€™s story and your personal journey. I am glad you were able to step back and take the time to be there for them and that you all had a wonderful time disconcerting in Jamaica! I wish you all strength, love, and peace.</p>
