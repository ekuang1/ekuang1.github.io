message: <p>Good luck in you new endeavors Phil. Your name and Scott Gu's are the two names that come first to mind when one thinks of ASP.NET MVC. The fact that Microsoft had visionaries like you, so passionate about MVC was a primary factor for us to give ASP.NET another chance. Scott is moving up the ladder and you are moving on... Personally for me MVC future is not looking too attractive after losing one of its primary locomotives. Seriously, I used to say that Microsoft web stack will always be competitive until people like Phil Haack working there.</p>
