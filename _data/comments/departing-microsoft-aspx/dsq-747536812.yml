message: <p>Pretty surprised to read this news barely a month after the post on how you're having a blast at MS even after four years. Best of luck with what's coming after - though I hope you won't forget how this position with Microsoft and more specifically NuGet made you as famous and well known in the community as you are now!<br>Also, why not wait with the post while you can tell us where the new position is? I've a feeling it's either Google's .NET division of Facebook's client side development!</p>
