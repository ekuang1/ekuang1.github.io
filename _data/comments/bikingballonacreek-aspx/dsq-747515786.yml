message: <p>This reminds me of a ride my wife and I took a couple years ago while visiting SF on a biz trip.  It was a nice ride across the GoldenGate and down into Sausilito, back across the bay on a ferry and then back down the waterfront to where we began.  It was a wonderful ride except for all the hills. ;)  Considering it was my first time on a bike since my college days (I can barely count the number of years on both hands and feet) I think we did ok.<br>The scenery was awesome.  There is nothing like Northern California and the Pacific Northwest for some great scenery.</p>
