message: <p>I used Jekyll for a few years, but the number one complaint I have is that if you have a LOT of blog posts (e.g. 1000) it takes forever for Jekyll to generate the site. I have almost 10 years of blog posts (started in 2004 with .Text and moved to Subtext as soon as it was released) and nearly 1000 unique posts. Jekyll simply isn't viable because of the site build time. The next best option is to render older content as a separate, static "archive" site and only publish new content in Jekyll. However, I notice you migrated all of your content from as early as 2004. How many posts do you have? Are you noticing any performance issues?</p><p>Also, when including images in your posts, you cannot use github to upload them, correct? In other words, you're forced to use a local git repo to add images. Running and maintaining the Jekyll/Ruby environment on Windows was always a giant headache. I'd like to be able to go 100% <a href="http://github.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="github.com">github.com</a>, but adding images to posts would prevent that.</p><p>Curious to know your thoughts.</p>
