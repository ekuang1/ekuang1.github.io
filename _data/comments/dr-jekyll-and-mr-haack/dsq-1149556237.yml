message: <p>I think Spolsky's argument is misunderstood.</p><p>Let's say HaackedSoftware was a company with Subtext as a product.  Time goes by, and many of your customers start realizing that there is other stuff out there that operates in a different manner that makes some tasks a lot easier.  And you're looking and thinking to make Subtext work that way would be a substantial amount of work.... a complete rewrite.</p><p>Going back to Spolsky's argument... as a company is it wise to rewrite Subtext?  The issue you raise of backwards compatibility is really the core of that question.  How much effort would be involved to rewrite Subtext in a way that maintains consistency with existing installations and makes everybody happy by providing exactly the same functionality?   That's a lot of work, which is Spolsky's point, and by abandoning the existing version as you rewrite you are abandoning the market.</p><p>But as a company, what's your main motivation?  You want to win over new customers, right?  So leave the existing customers on the old system, and start working on a new system, that provides these new benefits that people are starting to notice from other competitive products and over time work towards adding additional functionality that will win over your existing customer base.   For those existing customers where the new system meets their needs, they'll use it instead.  For those that don't, take their feedback on why the new system won't work and see if it can be improved over time with enhanced functionality.   As time goes on the new system should be more on par with the old system and more of your customers will adopt it.</p><p>This is sort of what Fog Creek did with Trello.  It's something new that does some of what their old FogBugz did, but not everything and it certainly allows teams to work differently in a way that would have been very difficult to introduce to FogBugz.</p>
