message: <p>What about tags and categories?</p><p>I really dig the workflow for creating/editing pages, and pull requests, etc using the gh-pages model. It's clearly much easier for you, the author.</p><p>But considering that tags and categories are now pointless... it's now much more difficult for the reader.  I wonder what your thoughts are on this matter.</p>
