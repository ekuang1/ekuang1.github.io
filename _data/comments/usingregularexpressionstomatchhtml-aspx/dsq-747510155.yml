message: <p>Can anyone help me out? I'm trying to build a regular expression to validate an SQL full text query. So something like:<br><br><br><br>"cable television" and "wireless bluetooth" OR "3G"<br><br><br><br>to ensure all booleans operators are outside quotes, and all text is in quotes. <br><br><br><br>Is this possible with a regular expression? or the wrong approach?<br><br><br><br>Cheers!<br><br>adrian</p>
