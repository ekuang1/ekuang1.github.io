message: <p>Found a case it doesn't handle:<br>It doesn't match if the attribute name has a non-word character.  For example, the hyphen in the first attribute below causes it to not match:<br>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"&gt;<br>This has been a huge help to me in maintaining hundreds of non-xhtml compliant pages.  Thanks!!!</p>
