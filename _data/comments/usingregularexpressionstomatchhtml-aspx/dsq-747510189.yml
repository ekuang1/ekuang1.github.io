message: <p>I'm trying to make a good regexp for finding html tags so that i could colour them (program for colouring code) and there is one problem with this regexp, it will mach &lt;br&gt; inside &lt;pre&gt; like for example here<br>&lt;pre&gt;some text&lt;br&gt;some more text&lt;/pre&gt;<br>and this shouldn't happen, &lt;br&gt; is not a tag anymore, it is a text. my knowledge of regexp is not big and i don't know how to fix this :(</p>
