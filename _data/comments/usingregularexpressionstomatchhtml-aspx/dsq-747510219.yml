message: <p>First off, thanks for the original regular expression, &lt;/?\w+((\s+\w+(\s*=\s*(?:".*?"|'.*?'|[^'"&gt;\s]+))?)+\s*|\s*)/?&gt;. It took me seconds, maybe a minute to find what I needed doing a google search. It took me much longer to get this working in my application using JavaScript. Since it was a PITA for me, I am going to show how I did it, because I would have been thankful to find this.<br>function ContainsHtml(inputText)<br>{<br>var htmlRegex = new RegExp(/&lt;\/?\w+((\s+\w+(\s*=\s*(?:".*?"|'.*?'|[^'"&gt;\s]+))?)+\s*|\s*)\/?&gt;/gim);<br>    <br>if(inputText.match(htmlRegex))<br>    {<br>return true;<br>    }<br>    return false;<br>}<br>The difficult part was setting this string &lt;/?\w+((\s+\w+(\s*=\s*(?:".*?"|'.*?'|[^'"&gt;\s]+))?)+\s*|\s*)/?&gt; in JavaScript with quotation marks and forward and backslashes. I started off by surrounding the initial regex string with quotation marks, then escaping the appropriate characters, but this did not work.<br>var re = "&lt;/?\w+((\s+\w+(\s*=\s*(?:\".*?\"|'.*?'|[^'\"&gt;\s]+))?)+\s*|\s*)/?&gt;";<br>After some time, I gave up and when this this approach, which worked.<br>new RegExp(/&lt;\/?\w+((\s+\w+(\s*=\s*(?:".*?"|'.*?'|[^'"&gt;\s]+))?)+\s*|\s*)\/?&gt;/gim);<br>Basically, I was escaping the wrong characters. Hope this helps, and thanks again for the regex Phil.</p>
