message: <p>I'm actually offended by this "Day without Immigrants".  I immigrated to this country legally.  I followed the rules and after 15 years I was able to successfully receive my citizenship.  The important thing is that I did all this legally.  I didn't run the river and sneak into the country.  Calling this day "A Day without Immigrants" offends me because I am one and I do not support illegal immigrants in this country.  Not all immigrants, especially legal ones, left work.  And not all immigrants, especially legal ones, support this rally.  They should have called this day "A Day without Illegal Immigrants" instead.  I support the tightening of our borders, and the immediate crackdown and deportation of all illegal immigrants in this country.  Why should they get any special treatment when they broke the rules, while millions of other immigrants successfully enter the country legally?</p>
