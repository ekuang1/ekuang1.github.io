message: <p>Basic rights as human beings are not being denied.  But I should not be forced to pay extra taxes to cover the cost of housing, feeding, medical care and prison space for the thousands of illegal immigrants who are pushing our government services to the breaking point.  It is very naive to believe that everyone who comes here illegally is a hard-working individual seeking work.  Talk to any Gang-Task force in the major metropolitan areas, talk to the emergency room staff at hospitals throughout the southwest, look at the statistics for the prison population and you will see that this is about more than just a bunch of people seeking a job.<br>If you think our laws our unreasonable, compare them to the laws of Mexico and you will see how one-sided this discussion is.  Why is it ok for Mexico to deny Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Guatemalans the very same rights that they are now in our country demanding from us?  Why do we round up chinese immigrants by the boatload and send them back but refuse to do the same for someone who walks across the Rio-Grande?  Why is it we demand that all citizens are paid a minimum wage but look the other way when employers exploit illegal immigrants and pay them less than what they should be making?  We decry the working conditions in sweat shops throughout the world and tollerate it here in our own country, as long as it is only happening to illegal immigrants.  We say you are not qualified to be Attorney General if you have hired an illegal immigrant, but once you become Attorney General you are free to ignore those very same laws by not enforcing them.<br>I agree with Phil that there is no easy solution, and we can all respectfully present our viewpoints, but I do know that rewarding people who circumvent our immigration laws only guarantees more of the same.  One of the fundamental defintions of any nation-state is the ability to control its own borders.  I fear we are very close to not being able to meet that basic definition.</p>
