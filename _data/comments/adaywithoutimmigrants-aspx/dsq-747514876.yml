message: <p>In one form or another, everybody in America is an immigrant.  Just depends how far back the family tree we want to go.<br>I find it ironic that Manifest Destiny isn't viewed in America as a massive immigration movement into Mexican lands that it was.  It obviously sets the precedent that if you live here long enough, you may deserve some rights.  If not, we should pull out of Texas and California.<br>That said, I do believe immigrants should come here by legal means.  But wishful thinking doesn't address the 20 Million who are already here.<br>Our immigration laws are woefully inadequate and out of touch with reality.  The current visa system favors the relatively rich and wealthy into white collar jobs.  They need to be reformed to reflect the realities of today.<br>But these are just my opininons and I respect that many will disagree with me vehemently on the issue of immigration.  <br>But there's a separate issue that the march also focuses on.  Bill HR 4437.  Regardless of where you stand on immigration, I think HR 4437 is not the answer.  It's a waterfall mentality to a problem that's best solved by an iterative approach.<br></p>
