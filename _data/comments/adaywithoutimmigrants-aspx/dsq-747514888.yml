message: <p>I see your point Joe, but the movement isn't advocating granting a path to citizenship to ALL illegal immigrants.  As you said, not every immigrant is hard-working.  <br>But many are. I'd say a majority are, but I don't have a stat I can show you right now.  Neither do you to show me that many aren't.<br>It is well documented that a large number of illegal immigrants do come here to work and DO PAY TAXES.  In that case, they aren't a drain but an actual boon to the economy.<br>I don't think it's such a black and white issue.  There isn't any solution that completely solves every issue.</p>
