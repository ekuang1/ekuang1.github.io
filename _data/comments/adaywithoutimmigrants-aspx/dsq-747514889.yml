message: <p>Joe, <br>Your statement that it is illegal immigrants that are "pushing our government services to the breaking point," is troubling.  Could it not also be that we are not properly funding these services?  Systems like Social Security and hospitals, at their best, are designed to allow the better off to support those in need.  A logical extension of your argument is that the sick and poor are pushing our health care system to the breaking point, and so we might do well to get rid of them.<br>This IS a question of human rights.  Do we provide these services to all people, or just American citizens?  If you accept illegal immigrants' presence in America as a reality, how do you deal with this reality?<br>In addition, the comment that we should "look at the statistics for the prison population" to "see that this is about more than just a bunch of people seeking a job," is absolutely horrible.  Labeling an entire community of people based on the ones that end up in jail is walking a fine line, nevermind suggesting that they are all criminal.  In the US, justice is rationed by wealth, making it difficult to convince me that a population's elevated numbers in prison have anything to do with their moral character as a community.  Do you judge all young, black males you meet based on their elevated numbers in America's prisons?<br>I suppose your statement on the necessity of a nation-state to control its borders refers to some perceived threat to our nation's sovereignty by these immigrants.  Immigrants crossing our borders to feed their families does not threaten our national sovereignty.  However, creating a permanent underclass of illegal workers; with lower wages and benefits, lesser working conditions, and no ability to organize; does pose a significant threat to most of the working class of this country.  Standards of living are lowered here, which is the real threat.<br>It's interesting that much of this economic situation, of lowered wages in the US and Latin America, was among the predicted consequences of NAFTA.  Are we really worried about people coming to America to work and live?  (Perhaps we ought to look into why they are coming.)  Are they really that different from other waves of immigrants before them?</p>
