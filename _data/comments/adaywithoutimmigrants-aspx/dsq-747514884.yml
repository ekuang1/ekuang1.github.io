message: <p>The over-arching issue here is human rights for all people.  Past immigration is being compared to current immigration to point out the hypocrisy of those who would criminalize immigrants.  It is not being used to justify it.  There is no need to justify demands for human rights, to which all people are entitled.  If we must, we only need look to the prinicipal of universality.</p>
