message: <p>Things may be different with Mexican immigration in South Carolina.  Once in North Augusta, they see apathetic employers, police and as long as they aren't breaking any more laws, no one bothers them. As a result more come.  In small towns that were dieing from population shift to the cities are seeing a slight influx of migrants.  Besides lowering wages and jobs in the construction and landscaping areas, the economic impact is positive. Culturally, it's a breath of fresh air.<br>I drive by the capital building in Columbia daily and saw no protests yesterday.  A couple weeks before I saw an 8 person anti-illegal immigrant protest in front of the capital.  However, I didn't understand their use of the confederate flag.  We all know the confederate flag symbolizes the continued Southern resistance to the 100+ years of occupation by Yankee agressors.  Yesterday in North Augusta there were a couple restaruants closed and a couple open.</p>
