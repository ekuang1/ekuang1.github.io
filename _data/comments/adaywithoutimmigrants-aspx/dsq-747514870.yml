message: <p>Wow man, great shots! That one from the roof is killer. We're having a similar rally later on this week. I doubt I will be in attendance though. Much like L.A. there is a very large immigrant population here in Charlotte (Latino and Vietnamese), so I'm sure the turnout will be huge.</p>
