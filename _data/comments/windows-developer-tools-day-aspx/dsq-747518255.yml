message: <p>I had the lucky chance to meet Jim Holmes at CodeMash on Friday (a.k.a- "Windows Developer Tools Day") while I was standing around thumbing through a copy of the book. I must say, what a great guy!<br>I introduced myself and then mentioned that you and I work together and his eyes lit up. Well, only long enough for him to say "Oh... you work with Phil - you poor guy!" Jim is obviously well acquainted with sarcasm.<br>At any rate, he gave me a free copy of the book and I'm really looking forward to spending a few hours flipping through the content to see what other tools the community at large is using.</p>
