message: <p>First, I enjoy this type of experimentation and like the direction you are going.<br>Ruby code does tend to have less cruft, but I wouldn't say no cruft. You may become immune to it (as C# coders become immune to semi-colons) - but look again and you will notice all of the extraneous $,:,{},&gt; symbols in your ruby example (I know they aren't extraneous to the compiler).<br>I'm sure your ruby routing library allows for more advanced scenarios, but the examples you provided can be very easily emulated with a simple extension method:<br>static class ReduceCruftWithCSharp {<br> public static void Map(this RouteCollection routes, string url, object defaults) {<br>    routes.Add(new Route(url, new RouteValueDictionary(defaults), new MvcRouteHandler()));<br> }<br>}<br>Now each of your C# route lines will be about the same length as the equivalent ruby line (the C# code starts winning as you add more defaults). So, in this case, it isn't even "less" cruft - its just "different" cruft.<br>$<a href="http://routes.map" rel="nofollow noopener" title="routes.map">routes.map</a> "default.aspx", {:controller =&gt; 'home', :action =&gt; 'index'}<br>vs.<br>Routes.Map("default.aspx", new {controller = "home", action = "index"});</p>
