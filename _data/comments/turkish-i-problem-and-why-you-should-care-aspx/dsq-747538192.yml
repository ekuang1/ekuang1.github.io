message: <p>@John As part of maintaining my own C# Coding Guidelines (<a href="http://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.csharpcodingguidelines.com">www.csharpcodingguidelines.com</a>), I've also defined a set of Visual Studio 2010 rule sets with a distinction between different types of systems.
