message: <p>The first .Net SDK I had under my hands (probably a beta of 1.0, but I don't really remember, it was surely more than 10 years ago), was incorrectly capitalizing the Turkish i as I. I did raise the issue with Microsoft at the time, and while they never answered me, the next time I looked at it, they had corrected the issue.<br>Funnily, I had looked because I had exactly the same issue with a JDK some time earlier, and I had managed to get Sun to fix that too :)</p>
