message: <p>Does the file system treat the dotless small-case i and the upper-case dotted I the same way? In other words, in Windows, does a *lower-case* file path containing a dotless small i match the same *upper-case* file path with a dotless upper-case I on Turkish systems, but not on other locales? (Sorry, it's confusing to explain)</p><p>I have a working locale-sensitive case-changing function based on LCMapString, but I'm wondering what to do with bits of the code where I tend to standardise file paths by making them lower case (and then later comparing them).</p>
