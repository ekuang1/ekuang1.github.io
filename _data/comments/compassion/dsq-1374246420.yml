message: <p>Hmmm.... You know, you are right in saying that. Those years of innocence and wonder for your kids will never come back again. My father missed them, and I know he tried to make up for it with his grandkids, but each experience is different.</p><p>On the flip-side, often there is the same anguish as you are watching a parent go through the last stages of their lives too. For me I was filled with "if only" then too, but for different reasons. I'd been away for school, then building my own career and family. Cuts both ways unfortunately.</p>
