message: <p>Beautifully put Phil... and a wake up call for me.  I have an 8 year old who has that true empathy and compassion you speak of and I might not always do my best to ensure that he keeps it, along with comfort in his ability to cry when he wants or needs to.  As others have mentioned, your post will make me try harder.  Thanks!</p>
