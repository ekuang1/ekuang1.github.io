message: <p>I'll immediately concur that it is great to see classmates jump in and console/protect.</p><p>I want to add, though, that I completely don't get how this is something about "men/boys crying". I see _a person overreacting_. That person must certainly get to grips with _that_, and that has **nothing** to do with "toughening up". It has more to do with chilling/take a breath/use common sense/using clues from behaviour of adults to build common sense etc.</p><p>So yeah. This little person may have a hell of a problem to outgrow. Fortunately, for now, his classmates don't (always) feel the need to give him another (social) problem in addition.</p><p>Seth</p>
