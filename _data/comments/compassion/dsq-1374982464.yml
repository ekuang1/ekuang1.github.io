message: <p>True! There's always morphine. But point well taken. I should have spoken only for myself.</p><p>Hey, on another note, I wanted to give you props. I was attempting to relate your story to my wife the other day, and when I got to the part about the way the kids were reaching out to comfort Tiberius, I choked up, teared up, the whole nine... had to pause to take a breath about five times to get to the end of the story. So THANKS for an incredibly uncomfortable moment. (No really. Thank you.)</p>
