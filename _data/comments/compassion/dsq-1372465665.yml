message: <p>It's good that you challenge us (fathers, adults, humans) to strive to be better versions of ourselves (develop more compassion, for example). But let's not leave this poor chap out of the limitless possibilities that come with personal betterment, too. Let's have some compassion on this boy's future self. Imagine him confined by his fears to a small, comfortable little world, sheltered and alone, never having conquered the pain necessary to achieve anything closer to his full potential. The world is FAR more beneficent than dog-eat-dog.. but even so...better to be eaten than to die wasted in your cocoon; never to fly; never to show the world your beautiful wings.</p>
