message: <p>Can we have a little understanding for Tiberius? Who knows what has led him to the place where a picture of a bee or other insert makes him react that way. I have 2 boys on the Autism spectrum, and the smallest thing can freak one or the other out on any given day.<br>It doesn't happen often, but when it does I am so glad that their classmates respond with kindness, respect and understanding, rather than how kids (including me I'll admit) would have done when I was at school 20 - 30 years ago.<br>Parents and teachers are doing a fantastic job raising children to be understanding and empathetic, treating people the way they would like to be treated in return. They may not be as outwardly "tough", but they are far, far better human beings, and that is much more important.<br>As you said in one reply Phil, there is plenty of time in later life to be exposed to the "dog eat dog" ways of the world. For now, I'm happy for my kids to live in a caring environment, where they get the support and understanding they need from their friends, classmates, teachers, parents and the wider community.</p>
