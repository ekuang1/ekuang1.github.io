message: <p>It's amazing that the six-year-olds would step up like that.  I don't think this is really a gender issue, though - I'd be equally amazed at the classmates' compassion if this child were a little girl.  Of course, society does have strong gender pressures, and they can be horrible, horrible things.  But it also comes down to local culture; I cried a whole lot as a boy in elementary school, and I'm fortunate to never really have suffered for it (...much).  Society isn't always as monolithic as we believe.</p><p>Regardless, this sort of standing up for your peers in need is the sort of thing that our world could benefit from so much.  You are right to encourage it, and I wish you the best of luck.</p>
