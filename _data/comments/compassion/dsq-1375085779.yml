message: <p>Thanks for sharing this story.  So glad to hear these children helping him out.  I have 3 boys myself.  Ages - 6, 3, and 5 months.  As you said in one of your comments, the growth will come in time, but at 6 years old, their shoulders are too small to heap such burdens upon.  In time, with love and compassion from myself and their mother, they will each work through fears and grow strong and courageous.  As for treating others well, I hope to help my boys retain that sense of compassion and understanding as they grow through the years.  God help me, because I know I don't always do a good job, but I'll keep trying.</p>
