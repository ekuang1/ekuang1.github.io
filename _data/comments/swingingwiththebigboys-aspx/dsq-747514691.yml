message: <p>Thanks to Mr. "I will construct a hyperlink to Jeff's blog with no leading www." Haack, I had to implement a rewrite rule that fixes this. Just try clicking on that link now. JUST TRY!<br>Linking variations of your domain name (eg, <a href="http://vitamins.megamart.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="vitamins.megamart.com">vitamins.megamart.com</a>, <a href="http://pheremonesmegamart.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="pheremonesmegamart.com">pheremonesmegamart.com</a>) to the same content is actually very harmful to your pagerank.<br>I'M TELLIN ALLA YALL ITS SABOTAGE!</p>
