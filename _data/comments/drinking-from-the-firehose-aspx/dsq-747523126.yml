message: <p>Hi Phil<br>I totally know where you are coming from. When I first joined Microsoft about two years ago I remember being told countless times about the firehouse. Initially the thought was "Yeah right". Then the hose opened and I just couldn't get it to shut. I never realized just how many acronyms one can use in one sentence, that is until my first week. I remember sitting in meetings where I had absolutely no clue what they were saying because the acronyms were rolling one after the other. <br>It does get better so hang in there. The first 3 months for me were insane, the next three were crazy (but not insance), then magically after 6 months things finally start settling. <br>One good piece of advice is find a mentor (Either formally or informally). A good mentor is worth their weight in gold.</p>
