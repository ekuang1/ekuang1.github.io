message: "<p>Good post, Phil, looking forward to having you around full time.<br>After being here for 10 (!) years, I especially like reading/hearing the experiences of two groups of people: (1) people just coming into MS and talking about how their expectations line up with their experiences, and (2) people who've just left MS out into the \"real world\", for the same reason.<br>See, yeah, there's a ton of stupid-smart people here.  But regardless of that, there's a special thing that happens when you're around people that are smart in a different way and/or have a different worldview.  That tends to drive a lot of growth as things you've \"settled\" on get challenged and uprooted, so enjoy it.<br>I've also found that it's very easy to conflate smarts with context.  Meaning, if you spend all day around smart people talking about smart things, you'll get used to talking about those concepts on their own.  What people might not realize is that here at MS we spend *forever* struggling over aspects of problems that 99.9% of people never even think of.  After a while you absorb all of that context, etc.  <br>Honestly the same thing happens the other way around.  When I talk to guys like you or Rob or other guys out in the industry I see a bit of the same thing...\"man, how do those guys know so much about X, Y, and Z...geez...I hope they don't ask me about that stuff!\"<br><br></p>"
