message: <p>What if you've migrated from Google's Blogger platform and want to preserve your comments? I've managed to import them, and change the URL's they were assigned to, but Disqus has given all the user's a Disqus email address, so all comments I made in reply to other people's now do not show up as me, even though I login to Disqus with the same email account as I did for commenting on Blogger.</p>
