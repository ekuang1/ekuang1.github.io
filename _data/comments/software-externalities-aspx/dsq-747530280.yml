message: <p>Nice response.  After reading his post, I'm not clear why he picks on Agile.  In my understanding of Agile - especially Lean - it's part of the process to weed out those things that cause waste - be they meetings, CI, or (heaven forbid) unit tests. I think people that argue against these things tend to exagerate how difficult they are.  A single developer can very easily and cheaply set up shop with a very rich agile process. I would agree with the general concept that there needs to be a modern solution for people to solve business problems very easily with little or no programming.  I do think software will eventually address the issues, but I disagree that Access is it.  SalesForce and similar come close, but are still too complex to really meet the need.  Enterprise suites like K2 also come close, but are too costly. Pretty much anybody who says "no programming required" today really means "learn to program our way". </p>
