message: <p>I'm not really sure why there is a feeling that Agile looks down on amateur developers as Ted states. Agile is not trying to turn all amateurs into professionals. The real issue is that there are too many amateurs acting as professionals. I like embedded development. I do it at home as a hobby. I am an amateur embedded developer. I wouldn't attempt to sell my services to an organization, or pretend that I know what it would take to build even a simple hardware device that would, for instance, control the flow of fuel to an engine for a consumer vehicle, but I have seen and will continue to see developers posing as professionals that have amateur skill sets. They slam something together without the slightest thought given to maintainability, correctness (that it actually works), or readability. It's not Agile that is creating this tension, it is those that joined an industry that changes rapidly, and yet have no desire to continuously learn and improve their skill set. We were all amateurs once, but some of us have sacrificed and continually climb up the learning curve for our careers. So, I don't blame Agile for not making things so simple an amateur can jump right in, the same way I don't expect becoming a surgeon to require reading a 100 page book and a few rounds with the Operation game, before I can start cutting someone open.</p>
