message: <p>I think that 'agile' is kind of a lost tangent on this point. The main thrust of what you guys seem to be about managing complexity in software systems. I get the Access argument – it was a single stop development/deployment tool. And while IDE’s do a much better job these days, I think the ‘single stop’ metaphor is mostly done. However, Azure is impressive and would do a lot for this, but I’m not sure how long until you guys realize that’s what’s next for Windows in general and ship it to the masses. Suggestion – don’t wait too long.</p>
