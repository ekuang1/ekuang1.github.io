message: <p>I'm glad to see you admit you might have missed the point.  For instance, I fail to see how you got to this:<br>"I got to thinking about this after reading Tedâ€™s latest post that Agile is treating the symptoms not the disease where the complexity that Agile introduces is disparaged"<br>At no point does he say that Agile introduces the complexity that I can see.  Instead, he says explicitly:<br>"The problem is the complexity of the tools we have available to us today preclude that kind of software development."</p>
