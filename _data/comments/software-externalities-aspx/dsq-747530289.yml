message: <p>I believe a lot of the perceived complexity of agile and agile tools is due to their immaturity and the complexity and inconsistency of the language surrounding its various components.<br>This will get better over time. The tools, books, computer science courses etc. will all improve and become simpler to grasp. Compare the simplicity of the latest versions of LINQ, Moq, JUnit etc. versus their predecessors. Now imagine where they will be in another 3-4 years time.<br>A lot of people want to rush in, but forget that many agile tools and processes have only been standard practice for a few years.</p>
