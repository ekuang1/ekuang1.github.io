message: <p>The tough things about blog entries that rarely is there a thesis upfront and/or a strict series arguments. Blog entries tend to be more of a narrative and higly introspecitive, with points enmeshed along the way. Therefore it can often be tough to elucidate the author's singluar thrust, if there is one.<br>I had to read his blog entry 3-4 times before before I could really get at the heart of what he was talking about. His thesis is in the third from the last sentence - that agile cannot manage software system complexity, only the design process. So agile serves as a current frame of reference, and not much more, in his narative. <br>You both make a lot of really good points of equal consideration. <br></p>
