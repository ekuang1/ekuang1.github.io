message: <p>"and not worry about "tomorrow" because it is an app that will only be used for a short time"<br>You usually can tell which those are i.e. if that app "will be replaced" i.e. if its to be replaced by something else "later"<br>That said, I can only recall 1 that was a 1 time app for real - was there to help with a very specific change the company was doing and the application helped managers with that. Everyone happy and the app did it job well and there was nothing left to maintain once the change period of the company was over :).</p>
