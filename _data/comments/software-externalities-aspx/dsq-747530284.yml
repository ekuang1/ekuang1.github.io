message: <p>I had an Information Systems professor at LSU, Andy Schwarz, that beat into my head the most important phrase I've learned for development.  He said, "There is no such thing as a technology problem, only business problems involving technology."<br>He taught me to always look at development from a business standpoint first, then from a technical one.</p>
