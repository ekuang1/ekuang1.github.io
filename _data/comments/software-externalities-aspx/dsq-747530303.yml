message: <p>An app will NEVER be better than the business process it assists. And companies are starting to realize that through 6-sigma, lean &amp; DFSS, but it's slow going. I worked for a F500 company with 70000 employees, and they were starting to train 3000 people per year in this stuff.  That's 23 years to train everyone.  But turnover rate is a significant problem, especially when 40000 of those employees were call-center employees who turned over almost 100% in a year.<br>But now, as a consultant/contractor, I always <strong>insist</strong> that a business process analysis be completed before I begin app design.  (And often this naturally leads to a DMAIC/DMADV process, which cleans up a lot of the mess.)  My customers have been <strong>hugely</strong> pleased.  The apps have been easier to use yet far more functional, and they meet the needs a lot better. I'm telling you, if you haven't employed Lean/DFSS, you need to. It makes all the difference in your reputation and in customer satisfaction, both internally and externally.<br>Nice post, Phil.  I'm with you.</p>
