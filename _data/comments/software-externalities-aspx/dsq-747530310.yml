message: <p>This post hits me at the heart. You talk about problems I live with everyday at work. Working in a small SH (boss + 2 employees) and having to face the "we don't have time, code fast, we won't reuse that" etc.<br>I hate that kind of approach. Why waste 1 hour today, when we can SPEND 2 or 3 hours to make something good, reusable, with a solid architecture, and (almost) future proof?<br>Someday my boss will tell me. In the mean time, I'll keep on fighting against the spaghetti code produced by my co-worker...</p>
