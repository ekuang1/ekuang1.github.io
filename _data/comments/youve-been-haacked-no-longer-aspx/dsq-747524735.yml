message: <p>I understand it's "just a joke", but to be honest... I find myself second guessing everything I am reading now especially on that day.. I really thought you were quitting blogging.... And I am now asking myself, "Is this an april fools day joke?"...  I realize people are going to think I don't have a sense of humour or what not, but really I don't think doing this is such a good thing, but anyway, thats my <em>personal</em> opinion.  I think that this would lead to confusion as more and more people are following google's trend....<br></p>
