message: <p>Phil,<br>You are a very smart developer and I have learned a lot from your blog. That said, I think this "April Fool Joke" was taking it a little too far. <br>You seem to be gloating in your own ego, somehow concluding that people "care" if you stop blogging. In reality, they don't. Since Google's CEO do this stupid "April Fool Joke", somehow you have equated yourself to them, when you are nowhere near where they are in terms of success or wealth. <br>Sorry !<br>~Puja.</p>
