message: <p>Thank goodness it's a joke. Nothing against you wanting to spend time with your family, but if I had to figure out all this new stuff on my own, I might be in a bit of trouble. Keep up the blogging and I'll keep reading. And if anyone gives you any "vitriolic comments", feel free to send me their address.
