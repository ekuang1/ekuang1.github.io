message: <p>The next conference for the Open Source community will be held from November 10 till 13, 2008 in Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, NV. After reading all your comments about last year, I will try to attend this year's conference. I couldn't find the schedule on the website yet, but the list of keynote speakers is impressive. Thanks for the tip.</p>
