message: <p>This is service locator, so, if you are happy to use it, why not just locate the services you need inside a concrete handler. <br>This solves the per request thing too, in that you can call the service locator in the BeginRequest or, if global, in the constructor.</p><p>Moving the logic to a service is probably the right thing to do here anyway for testing and interchangaswappableness, leaving the HttpModule as a wrapper with the single responsibility of calling those services in a "HttpModule kind of way".</p>
