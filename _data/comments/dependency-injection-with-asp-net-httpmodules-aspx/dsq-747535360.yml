message: <p>Have you tried MVC Turbine?  It has been doing this since MVC V1, magically behind-the-scenes and for all ioc containers.  If you have a HTTP module, it resolves it out of your ioc container of choice without you having to do one additional line of code.<br>Cases like these are the main reason I use MVC Turbine, and why I wish its features would g we adopted by ASP.Net MVC.  Many devs, if not most, need this functionality.  When its not provided by the framework, it leaves EVERY dev to write or copy-paste huge chunks of code that do exactly the same thing.  Aren't these the types of problems</p>
