message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>        Thanks for your article. The one thing that we would lose by dynamically registering HttpModules is the ability to set preconditions for them without tinkering with IIS. Is there a way to programmatically set the preconditions for a HttpModule?<br>Thanks,<br>Ashwin</p>
