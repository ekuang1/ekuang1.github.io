message: <p>Hahaha.  What an interesting question and an even more interesting set of rules I think if i could go back i would not be too shocked to see myself so therfor it would be safe to do so. And have a word about ideas and what the future really brings the likes of jquery, facebook and gocompare would be top of the agenda but would this cause a paradox loop where i never get past the day i jump back???  Problem with back is you can do anything even kill your dad and nothing will change for yourself as changes will only create a new timeline a seperate version of yourself that is rich and invents facebook would you even travel back in time to give yourself the idea if you had already created the idea??? Hence the need for multiple versions of your own path in lifenso in reality you would only make the other versuons of yourself rich. If you want to get profit from. A time machine the only wa is to hire out thebusage if the time machine to. Other fools who think they can make themselves rich and powerful :-)</p>
