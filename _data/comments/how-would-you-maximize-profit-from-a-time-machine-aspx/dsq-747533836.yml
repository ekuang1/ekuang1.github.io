message: <p>The easiest method (and with no dangers of paradoxes) would be to wait until the day after the lottery, say a Sunday, then go back to Saturday and buy a winning ticket.<br>Then all you have to do is post it to yourself, and then travel back.  When you return, you can have a normal Sunday evening and wait for the mail man the next day to deliver your winning ticket to your door.<br>Done, there's no chance of a paradox, you haven't altered your past at all, and you are just another lottery winner, no need to make a new identity or anything like that.<br>Gaw</p>
