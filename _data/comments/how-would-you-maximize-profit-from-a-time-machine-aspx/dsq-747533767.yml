message: "<p>The problem with the sports almanac is that eventually you'll get blocked by Vegas and bookies and such if you make too much money. So you'd have to play it slow, which would detract from maximum profit.<br>Stocks are problematic because you would run into trouble from the SEC or the banks eventually (a lot like the mafia and bookies, really).<br>Real estate is the best way. People buy land in the middle of nowhere all the time, some get rich, some don't. No one will think it suspicious.<br>So the correct answer is:  Sell everything you own now, run up as much debt as you can and buy the most expensive gems you can because they will have great value in the past and they have the greatest value by weight/size of anything I can think of.  Maybe not gems, but whatever the maximum value per density and volume you can find. Stuff it in your backpack and go back and give it to earliest, most responsible self (maybe when you were 23-25 or something like that). Explain the plan and tell yourself which properties to buy, what to build there, when, and when to sell, etc.</p>"
