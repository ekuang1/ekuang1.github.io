message: <p>This assumes you want to come back and you're interested in being rich in today's economy.  A much better scenario would be the following:<br>*  You sell your stocks, cash out your 401K, liquidate all assets.<br>*  Sell your house but right before the new owner takes possession, you set a bomb in the time machine room to detonate it after you leave.<br>Assuming you've done all of that, you may have something like $200K+ available in cash.  Keep in mind, you'll probably need to make sure you have the old bills (not the new-fangled giant head dollar bills).  Then, according to the <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=250000&amp;year1=2010&amp;year2=1913" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=250000&amp;year1=2010&amp;year2=1913">CPI Inflation Calculator</a>, $250K in current money would have the same buying power as $11K in 1913.  The year is less important if you go back far enough - key point is that with today's cash you could be very wealthy.  <br>Having hindsight is much more important in this case because you would know which startups/companies succeed and which do not.  You could then use your 2010 money to invest in the appropriate ventures and eventually buy that island you've always wanted, run for president, etc.<br>Regarding identity, with the lack of computers to track that information - it would be very easy to create an identity.  Or you could just wander over to Ellis island and immigrate into the US.  <br>I suppose you could use this method to invest on behalf of your future self and then just will it to yourself in the future in a trust - but then you risk creating a paradox because future you doesn't travel back in time and well, that's a problem.  In-fact, all of the scenarios where you return to the present are littered in paradoxes because if you buy stocks or set yourself up to get rich in the past - can you be guaranteed that you'll still have the time machine in the alternate future?  In-fact, by changing your past - you may have nowhere to return in the future and you may end-up just getting stuck in the past.  I'd rather plan to stay and say f* you to the future. :)</p>
