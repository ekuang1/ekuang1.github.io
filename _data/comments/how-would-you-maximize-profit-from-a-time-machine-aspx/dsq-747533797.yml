message: <p>Well, you kind of answer your own question in the post, when you say your past self would react to your actions when you go back. Being a developer (a smart one :P) I know that the best way to make a small thing huge is recursivity. So I go back in time, I tell my-self all the history I can remember of what happened and <strong>let him</strong> decide the best way to make money, have fun, gain knowledge, or whatever. It is clear that when one-self would gain enough to be happy, he would have no reason to build a time machine and the loop would end without a stack overflow. Taa-daaa!</p>
