message: <p>I'd send myself a handwritten letter back in late 1985.  This letter would have three elements:<br>(1) A secret that only I would know, to prove it was from me, and not from a forger.<br>(2) A description of the Challenger disaster and ensuing investigation, to prove it was the <strong>future</strong> me.<br>(3) An instruction along the lines of:<br>Buy as much Microsoft stock as you can afford, and sell it around New Years' 2000. By then everybody knows there's a tech bubble, but nobody knows when it will burst, so you won't look too wacky selling out.<br>Sink the profits into real estate until Q1 2005 or so.  Again, nobody thinks the price increases are sustainable, so getting out looks cautious, not suspicious.<br>I'm really not sure what to do after that.</p>
