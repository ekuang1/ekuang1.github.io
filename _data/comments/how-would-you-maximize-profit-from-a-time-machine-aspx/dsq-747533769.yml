message: <p>Historians like to find 'inflection points' in history where changing one event could have massively changed the outcome of world events.  An interesting one would be to go back to the early 1900s, travel to Europe, and warn Archduke Franz Ferdinand of his coming assassination.  Would WWI have never occured, and consequently WW2, the cold war, korean war, vietnam, etc. etc.?</p>
