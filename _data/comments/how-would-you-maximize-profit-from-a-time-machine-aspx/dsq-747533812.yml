message: <p>Easy.<br>1. Research the largest lottery winnings possible between my current age and 18 (legal age to claim it).<br>2. Get said lottery numbers, then look at the historical stock markets of a few well known stocks from the winning date.<br>3. Go back in time, buy the lottery ticket. Then find someone who can setup a trust for the winnings.<br>4. Claim money, setup future stock orders at given dates to time the market.<br>5. Come back, claim the money from your trust, and buy way to many gadgets.<br>6. Stuff money under mattress, since well you can't use the time machine again to predict the future.</p>
