message: <p>Lottery ticket problem solved. Just get the winning lotto numbers when they're drawn. Jump back in time to an hour ago (just before the numbers were drawn). Buy your lotto tickets. Jump back to present day and claim your prize. This solves the problem of freaking out your former self because he's already created the time machine and knows all about it. If I've made a time machine, I'm pretty much expecting to get a visit from myself, right?</p>
