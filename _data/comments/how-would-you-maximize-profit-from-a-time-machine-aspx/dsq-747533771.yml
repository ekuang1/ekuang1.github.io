message: <p>Glad this is just hypothetical and you aren't using your real time machine for this.<br>Go back, establish an identity, buy a winning lottery ticket, get in on the Amazon IPO, and the Google IPO, maybe invest in <a href="http://Broadcast.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Broadcast.com">Broadcast.com</a> if I was able. Then the final beautiful piece, steal Facebook from Zuckerberg.  By then, I could hire the people to figure out how.<br>Now if I went back 20 years and was myself 20 years younger but I knew then what I know now... Wow! That would change everything.  Keep the money, I have better things to do.</p>
