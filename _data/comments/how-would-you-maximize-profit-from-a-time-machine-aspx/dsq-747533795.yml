message: <p>I'd go back and write a letter to myself, one where I prove my identity via a photo I take of my older self, then I'd lay out a few things to do that I "should have" done back then. e.g. Buy <a href="http://creditcards.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="creditcards.com">creditcards.com</a>, <a href="http://wine.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="wine.com">wine.com</a>, <a href="http://cellphones.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="cellphones.com">cellphones.com</a>, <a href="http://realestate.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="realestate.com">realestate.com</a>, etc. Also I would let myself know exactly what websites to build to capitalize on the adsense and adwords glory days when everything was easy and lucrative. I'd also tell myself to start a free dating site and a host of credit card and loan review/comparison sites.</p>
