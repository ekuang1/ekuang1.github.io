message: <p>Assuming your rules all work,and you can modify the timeline you will arrive back in, etc etc;<br>1. Since you only have one shot, and will be missing in the time between the endpoints of the trip have multiple sources of income arranged in case some fall through due to unforseen human error/theft.<br>2. To avoid the paradox each source of modern income must be unknown to you until you know about the time machine.<br>3. Assemble period cash, bullion, gems etc, as seed money.<br>4. Assemble lists of sports info, lottery numbers, top earning stock transactions per day for dest +2 years top yearly for interum time, simple inventions invented in the dest year etc, encrypt in simple cypher in case stolen (ie book cypher), have backup info memorized..<br>5. Assemble list of institutions that existed in your planned destintation time and exist today.<br>6. Get period documents forged as one of your relatives who looked vaguely like you at the time, or for a person who' died far enough back to be your age (Again relative by preference).(multiple sets is better)<br>7. Get master dealer keys made to all the common vehicles in your destination time, just in case you need to steal a car in the past.<br>8. Travel back in time to when you were just born, bet on all the above methods earn a nice nest egg.<br>9. Set up a Trust fund for yourself not to be revealed till return date +1 day.<br>10. Buy property and set up trust to manage it, to be given to you on your &lt;age now +1&gt;th birthday.<br>11. Get the Trust set up wtih laywers and a address.<br>12. Fund retirement account for your self at a bank you've never done buisness with, one that does not generate tax burden, send all account statments to Trust address, pick good funds or even index funds.<br>13. Buy period stuff that's valuble now, put in safe Depotit box, pay for 100 years up front. Bring key back with you (same for all other boxes).<br>14. Get antoher Safe deposit box at a seperate bank fill with bullion and gems, same setup.<br>15. Buy physical shares of small companies that are giants now, depending on birthdate, IMG, INTEL Dell, whatever, 3rd saftey deposit box, 3rd bank.<br>16. Bury more gems &amp; high value items in a secret location known to you and researched to be undisturbed into modern times.<br>17. Buy winning lottery ticket, set up corporation to hold and invest money in index funds, all stock to be gifted to you on N+1 birthday.<br>18. Find a building you know is there in dest time, hide money in a wall that's being built, so you can retreive it in return time.<br>19. Take the rest of the stock tips to a rich trustworthy friend of the family if such exists, or known buisness man. Set up a deal with him if he makes profits from the tips, he holds 10% for you on your return.<br>20. Rip of any other good ideas from this list, that meet the critera, add here.<br>21. buy back all the gems you sold, to bring back so they are not duplicated, under GIA inspection.<br>come back with a bigger pocket full of gold &amp; gems and if even one pays off you're better off than when you left and if most do you're stupid rich.<br></p>
