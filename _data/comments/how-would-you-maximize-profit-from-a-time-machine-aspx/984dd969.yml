  Well, the easiest choice for me would be:



  Sell everything I can sell, take it out. Go back to 2016, find a way to insert this cash into limited platforms before Binance (for example) and buy as many bitcoins I can. I will keep the info and encryption phrases with me, if I can’t take them with me I sowed them on my clothes, or tattoo them, or take as much time I can to remember them. 



  Return and log in, boom. Not that easy but easier than to travel to 1800s or 1900s.



  The only question would be, how to insert this cash into an account without raising eyes... I guess I only need to find someone who is willing to do it and I give them something for it. Then if they ever get questioned they will never know who I was, and since naturally it wasn’t theirs, nothing will happen. I mean if I offer them 10k to a random person I guess they’ll be willing to do it. Especially someone that needs it.



  Since 2016 to 2021 BTC has increase by almost 14,000% so I guess that would be the best choice,no?
