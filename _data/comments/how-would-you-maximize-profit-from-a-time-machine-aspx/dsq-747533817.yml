message: <p>I am going to be the jerk in the bunch and say - it doesn't matter.<br>Time travel backwards would result in two results:<br>1) You travel into one of infinite alternate universes, in which you can assume nothing of the future.  Google is a flop, Tiger Woods joined a gang, and all government decisions are based from who has the highest score in Ms. Pacman.<br>2.) You travel back to your own timeline, and since your future is already known, anything you do will not effect the future. In short, you are as broke as you left.<br>The moral of the story? Learn from the past, dream the future, and execute in the present.  ;)</p>
