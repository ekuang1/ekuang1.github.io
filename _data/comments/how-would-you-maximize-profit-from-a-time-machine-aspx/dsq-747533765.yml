message: <p>Wouldn't it be better to travel to the future, and bring new knowledge and insights back to the present, and benefit from them when you can experience it yourself?<br>I'd go to the future and bring back the next big thing, and made it my own, for example the recipe for awesome electral batteries or another form of power plant. Then just live on that "stolen invention".<br></p>
