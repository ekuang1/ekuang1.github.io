message: <p>Looks like somebody has a new Netduino project :)<br>Seems like buying the winning lottery ticket for a large payout the day before is the way to go. Just leave the winning ticket on the counter before you go back to the future where you can pick it up and head to the lottery office! <br>For fun, you can go out for a drink with yourself just like the Stoli ads :)</p>
