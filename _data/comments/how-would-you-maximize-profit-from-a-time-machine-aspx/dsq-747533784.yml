message: <p>I think the scenarios where you go back and try to convince yourself are fraught with peril. You'd probably be freaked out to see a guy who looks just like you but is older. Maybe you could claim you're a long lost uncle. But still.<br>Just buying a lottery ticket is problematic. How do you get the winnings back.<br>One idea I had was to go back, buy several winning lottery tickets, and mail them anonymously to my younger self with a note with suggestions on what to do with the winnings. Of course this assumes that by doing so, I didn't spawn another universe/time line and when I return, I'm still a broke ass PM. ;)<br>Damian, good point! But you know what I meant. We can hypothesize that the process of going back in time is affected by gravity so that you can't travel to another point on Earth, but will remain at the current position relative to Earth's position in the universe. ;)<br></p>
