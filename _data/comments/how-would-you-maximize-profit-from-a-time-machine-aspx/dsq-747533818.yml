message: <p>I would go back far enough in time to find a gold mine that was going to yield a huge haul.  Then buy the land and setup a company to keep anyone from doing anything with it until now.<br>Then I'd go start digging now and pull all of the gold out.<br>'Course that could drive the price of gold back into the single digits - so maybe it's not such a good idea.<br>Although you could just pull a little out at a time and sell it off in pieces....</p>
