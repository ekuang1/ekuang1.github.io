message: <p>Lottery ticket one is easy to do - you don't have to get the winnings back, just claim them into the present. <br>Once you know the numbers go back 1 day, buy the ticket, leave it somewhere safe. Then head back to the present, grab the ticket and claim your winnings - simple!<br>Other methods would very quickly get tricky - you'd have to assume you couldn't access your accounts safely in the past as the other you would notice, unless it was the really recent past. <br>Also you couldn't take large amounts of money back to the past to invest unless it was small amounts and to the really recent past as then you'd either have bills in the system with duplicate serial numbers or bills whos numbers aren't registered leading to you getting arrested in the past.<br>The lottery system could equally be applied to betting on sports events but I think the trick is to not travel too far back and to be able to redeem in the present so your involvement with others outside your natural timeline is minimized.</p>
