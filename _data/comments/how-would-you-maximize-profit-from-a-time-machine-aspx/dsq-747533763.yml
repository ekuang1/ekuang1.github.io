message: <p>For me it would be to purchase land.  In the late 1800s the land around my city(Calgary, AB) could be purchased very cheaply, even had for free if you agreed to clear the land.  Fast forward to today and tiny lots on the outskirts of the city cost 100k, a couple of quarter sections(2.59km^2) a couple of kms from downtown would be worth a huge amount.  The one trick would be having enough money available to pay the 100 years of property tax.  I would have to spend a couple of years in the past to earn enough money to start a trust to pay the taxes.  I would leave written instructions about what to buy into over the next 100 years.  Really written, legaly binding, instructions for a trading company would be idea for building wealth up to a point.  At some point the amount of money in the trust will mean that your buying and selling of shares is going to alter the future and the instructions will no longer be valid.</p>
