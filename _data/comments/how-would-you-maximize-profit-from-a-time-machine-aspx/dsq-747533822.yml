message: <p>I have an issue with this rule:<br>#2 The time machine can only transport you back in time and back. It can’t transport you through space to another location. So if you live in Seattle Washington, you can travel back in time to any year, say 1951, but you’ll still be in Seattle.<br>That doesn't work, It has to have the ability to travel through space as well or you will die when you travel back. Your living room is on a rotating planet which is spinning around a sun which is travelling through space away from the center, it will never exist in the exact same place on 2 occasions. So your living room now will be space 50 years ago or a mile underground 5 years ago etc...<br>To actually answer the question i guess id take something back, patent it, produce and sell it. Something like a solar panel or maybe iphone :)</p>
