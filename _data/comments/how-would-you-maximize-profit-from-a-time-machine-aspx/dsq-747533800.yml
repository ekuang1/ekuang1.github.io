message: <p>Why go for profit? What purpose does profit have, if it's without happiness? I would pursue happiness instead, using the knowledge I have now about many people to choose the right friends in the past. I know whom to trust and whom will betray me, so with that knowledge I could strengthen my bonds with the right people. When you're with those you trust, then going for profit together is a lot easier.<br>I'd also remember the winning numbers for the lotto, which doesn't give away huge prices back then, but still enough to use as investments in certain stocks. Win a few times, perhaps, buy a lot of stock and then be patient. Won't make me happy, though. Plus, I fear for a time-travel paradox:<br>When you go back in time, you will alter the future. Time will branch away from the mainstream and all future events would be unpredictable. The winning lotto numbers could be different, and if they are, I'd only lost a few coins but gained the knowledge that the future has changed. So, the lotto won't just make me rich, it would also tell me how predictable the future would be. Because if the past wouldn't repeat itself, I'd just be living my life all over again...</p>
