message: "<p>A single $20 bill could score you 400 copies of Action Comics #1 in mint condition. Conservatively speaking each book would get you about 3 Million when sold.  That's 1.2 B-B-Billion for one Andrew Jackson. You would, of course, need to then slowly release them into the collector's market so as to not devalue them.</p>"
