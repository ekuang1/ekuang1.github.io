message: <p>If you could go forward first and then come back going ten years into the future, discovering what company / investment had the best return over the previous ten years and then returning would be quite profitable (assuming stable timelines, etc.).<br>If you had to go to the past first I think I would take knowledge from today and go back and reap the rewards there.  Imagine the riches that a person who could produce pennicillin pre-1900 could reap.  Or produce clotting factor and save the life of Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevic (son of Tsar Nicholas II).  Not only would I expect that the Tsar would be generously grateful but you might avert the Bolshevic Revolution.  Or you could study Latin and then go back to ancient Rome and sell soap.<br>I have a problem with the lottery ideas here - none of them produce a benefit for society and expand the pie, they just move money from another pot to their pot.  But if I were to go that route I would go back to 2000 and establish myself as a programmer again, probably in another town to avoid running into my earlier self, earn enough to establish a trading account, and short tech stocks.  In mid 2001 I would take my profits and buy treasury bonds, take delivery and stash them in a safe deposit box for pick-up upon my return.</p>
