message: <p>I'd rather take my profits in the present rather than through some speculative chrono-adventure.  I would let investors bid on my trip.  That way I could set some basic conditions (no active volcanoes please), have a financed expedition, and if a dinosaur ate me or some Yankee shot me, my family could be reimbursed.<br>Lottery tickets and investment schemes are for chumps.  The chance to get a man on the ground at one of the pivotal points (or places) in history would easily be worth billions.</p>
