message: "<p>I'd pack a backpack full of tulip bulbs and travel back to 1637. Amsterdam is 500 km away from where I am living, so the voyage to there should take just a couple of weeks. Once I am there, I could sell them for about 30.000 Netherlands gulds a piece (the average house in Amsterdam cost about 10.000 at that time). Next, I'd invest half of my money in Amsterdam real estate, and put the other half on a Rothschild numbered bank account (that bank alredy existed at that time and still exist today). <br>P.S.: My girlfriend would sell pepper in Amsterdam and buy some diamonds with the revenue.</p>"
