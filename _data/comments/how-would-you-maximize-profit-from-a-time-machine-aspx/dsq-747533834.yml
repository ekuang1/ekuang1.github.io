message: "<p>Very interesting topic, the idea of time travel astounds me.<br>I personally live at the southern tip of California, right near the border. So the way I see it, I should pack as much salt as I can possibly carry. Why salt, you ask? Well hundreds upon hundreds of years ago *starts time machine*, I believe that at one point in areas such as South America, salt was in fact worth its weight in gold. Now, surely, if one could find a way to transport as much salt as possible to the ancient world to exchange it for vast amounts of useless soft, yellow metal, then surely a huge profit could be reaped considering gold is worth over 5000 times the value of salt. (Makes you think of a trick question, really: which weighs more, a pound of salt or a pound of gold?)<br>Or, one could of course go with the classic \"win every lotto...ever\" method. But I'm betting winning more than one will warrant a federal investigation of some sort.</p>"
