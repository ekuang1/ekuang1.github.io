message: <p>I like the "jump back one day" suggestions for the lottery ticket. Except with my luck, I'd die horribly in space because the planet wasn't in the same spot a day ago.<br>If tried jumping back a century, I'd probably die horribly again because of the expanding nature of the universe. Maybe I'd get lucky and end up on someone else's planet. With a breathable atmosphere. But fall hundreds of metres to my death. Maybe a bowl of petunias will keep me company on the way down.</p>
