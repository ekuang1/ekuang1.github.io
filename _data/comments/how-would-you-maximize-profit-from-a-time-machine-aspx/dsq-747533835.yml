message: <p>If you go back to yesterday and buy lottery tickets, why bother handing it to your younger self, or looking for a safe-box for you to collect in the future?<br>Why dont you just buy the tickets, put it in your pocket, take them with you to the future, and claim the prize?<br>You'll make millions of profit, and your younger self wouldnt even know you had came for a visit.</p>
