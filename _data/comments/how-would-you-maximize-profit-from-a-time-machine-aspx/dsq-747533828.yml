message: "<p>I'll go back in 1994 and buy a lot of Magic: the Gathering cards for 1$ or 2 that sells hundreds of dollars today.<br>With the content of a Bank coffer, I could transfert enough to build a house today. Especially since mass-buying them would cause even more rarity today.<br>Make a search for \"Black Lotus Beta\" on ebay if you don't understand what is Magic: the Gathering. Add \"PSA9\" to the search if you have solid guts.</p>"
