message: <p>The PATCH issue really sucks - I get a lot of code thrown to me that I have to sift through and see what's changed. Unless it's commented severely (so I knows where to goes) then it's just about unusable to me. <br>Often I get 2Mb project files in my email with "I made some bugfixes - here ya go". Don't get me wrong - I really do appreciate the love flowin here but I just don't have the time to DIFF on the fly :).<br>That said, the tradeoff of the voting system on the Work Item list is pretty swingin - let's me know what people are thinking and has the added effect of decreasing duplicate reports.<br>The Wiki feature really helps with creating docs - but then only the Devs can do that which is a PITA. The Commit-access thing is not easy!<br>Finally - SourceForge is really a tired horse (in my mind) and I heard somewhere that their forums are "Garbage" :).</p>
