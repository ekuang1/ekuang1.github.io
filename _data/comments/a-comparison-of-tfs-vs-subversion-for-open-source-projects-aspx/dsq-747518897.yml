message: "<p>&gt; somehow Beyond Compare will know about the file and folder renames and deletions and apply that in the patch<br>I want to go deeper: why can't you give people who want it commit access? Isn't that the very POINT of source control? Why keep the peons locked outside the castle and force them to submit patches?<br>I definitely see the utility for casual developers, who will be \"one hit wonders\" submitting a single patch and never participating in the project ever again.<br>&gt; CodePlex was not intended to be a showcase for TFS. It's intended to be the home for Open Source projects. That's coming straight from the CodePlex team.<br>They say that, but I honestly don't believe them. Actions speak louder than words, so if they drop TFS and switch to a Trac-like system, then you'll be right.<br>If they don't, then I'm right.<br>Basically you have to wait for TFS to get the featureset you need on CodePlex. So post-Orcas (Orcas is an \"adoption\" release for Team System, with no breaking changes except in Build), which is God knows when.<br>Or maybe you're less cynical than I am, but I'd put large sums of money on my predicted outcome, eg, this is just how Microsoft works.<br>&gt;  Can you imagine telling a customer of any product that?<br>Yes, you should demand a refund immediately. Here's your nothing back.</p>"
