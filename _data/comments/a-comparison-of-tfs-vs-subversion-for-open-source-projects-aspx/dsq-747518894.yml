message: <p>We were going with TFS for a while.  Had it setup on a test version of the software.  After using it for a few months, we realized that it is overkill for a source control system.  Granted, it does what five open source programs are necessary to do, but those open source programs do a better job.  <br>Recently, we went to Subversion and Trac.  We couldn't be happier.  <br>Phil, have you looked at <a href="http://www.devjavu.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.devjavu.com">http://www.devjavu.com</a> for hosting your project?  Jeff Lindsay has created a really great product over there.</p>
