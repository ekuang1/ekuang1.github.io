message: <p>&gt; On the other hand, you absolutely should be<br>&gt; able to add users as read-only on a project.<br>&gt; This is totally possible in TFS; no idea why<br>&gt; they haven't exposed it yet. They could even<br>&gt; emulate anonymous access by providing a<br>&gt; generic read-only login for people to use<br>We tried granting all users read-only access to all projects, and the TFS server fell over because its security subsystem can't handle that many security permissions.  So we need to limit the number of users with security permissions on the server to keep it running.<br>We also thought of the idea of providing a generic read-only login for people to use, but we can't do it because of security issues.  Since a users workspace is stored on the server, anybody would be able to view and modify any workspaces associated with the login giving the potential to modify another users workspace and cause them to overwrite files or folders in any location on their hard drive on their next Get Latest Version.<br>However I guarantee you that we are listening and determined to address user requests.  Users votes have been great to let us know what we need to focus on.</p>
