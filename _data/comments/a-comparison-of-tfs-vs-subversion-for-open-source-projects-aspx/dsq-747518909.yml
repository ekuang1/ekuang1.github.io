message: <p>&gt;I think there is precedent for <br>&gt;Microsoft choosing the right technology<br>&gt;for the right market.<br>Um..didn't they just choose (or rather, build) a different Microsoft technology? Seems like a bit of a stretch to conclude that MS might adopt an open-source VCS from that example. <br>Microsoft seems to pretty much epitomize NIH syndrome. I have to say I'm with Jeff on this one. I think it'll be a cold day in hell before Codeplex offers SVN hosting. Maybe, MAYBE, if they turn it into a profit center, but I haven't seen much sign of them trying to monetize Codeplex.<br>Codeplex may not be a "showcase" for TFS. But it could very well be a proving ground for it. Helping them shake out scalability issues and explore the limits of the engine. It's certainly a faster way to get a large active user base than selling into enterprises.<br></p>
