message: <p>&gt; That's what you guys need to be voting up, <br>&gt; not tilting at this subversion windmill.<br>Jeff, look. The point of this post was to point out that TFS is not an ideal source control system for open source projects. <br>Fine, let's take Subversion off the table for a moment. Let's say we just want Codeplex to support the issues I raised. Can it using TFS? Jonathan's comment seems to imply it can't. It cannot scale at that level.<br>CodePlex was not intended to be a showcase for TFS. It's intended to be the home for Open Source projects.  That's coming straight from the CodePlex team.<br>So why shouldn't we point out that Subversion would be a great addition to Codeplex because it already solves these problems, from the very start? It was designed from the beginning to be good at Open Source development because it itself is Open Source.<br>Sure, we won't get the TFS integration with work items. Frankly, I'll be happy to give that up. They could implement work items using a simple database store and keep voting and Codeplex would still kick butt.<br>As I see it, CodePlex is a product. It has almost everything I want in such a product, except for these few things. To say, well they use TFS and TFS can't handle it so go somewhere else is ludicrous. Can you imagine telling a customer of any product that?<br>If your choice of technology can't handle your user scenario, it may be time to re-evaluate that technology choice.<br></p>
