message: <p>My company is also comparing TFS to Subversion.  We've been using Subversion successfully on some projects for about a year.  But, the big advantage that we see in TFS is that it's an integrated "all-in-one":<br>it does bug tracking, reporting, assigns work, etc....all under one roof.  Specifically, the integration of Sharepoint, Project Server, and Portfolio server.<br>So, with that in mind, I wanted to know what people thought of TFS compared to Subversion with Collab.Net, Roundup, Jira, or Trac.<br>Can Subversion with one of those packages compete, or is something like Clear Case with Rational Suite more of a direct competitor to TFS?</p>
