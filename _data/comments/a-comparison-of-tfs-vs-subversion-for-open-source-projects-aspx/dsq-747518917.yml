message: <p>Thanks for the tip Jay. Right now, we're using SourceForge for ticket tracking. I'm not aware of any easy way to integrate with SF.<br>Maybe we'd be better off using a real ticket tracker, but then our project information is even more disjointed (Website here, forums there, issues over there).</p>
