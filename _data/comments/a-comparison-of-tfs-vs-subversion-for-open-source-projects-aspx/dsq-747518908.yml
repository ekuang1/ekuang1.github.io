message: <p>&gt; I have your bridge Mr. Haack. Did you order the <br>&gt; Brooklyn or Golden Gate? ;) <br>I'll take both!<br>&gt; If CodePlex is meant to be the home for OSS, why <br>&gt; use TFS at all?<br>I can only speculate on this, not knowing for sure. But Microsoft has a tendency to use Microsoft software for its online properties. In part, I think this is a good thing as part of their culture of "dogfooding" their own code. <br>TFS is much better than Visual Source Safe so why not try it to get a jump on building an open source platform by using it?<br>Despite the critique I wrote, there are a lot of benefits of using TFS.<br>But choice of technology doesn't <em>necessarily</em> equate to showcase for that technology. For example, my company originally chose DNN for our website. That doesn't mean we were showcasing DNN. And when DNN proved overkill for our needs, we ripped it out (though we still use it for our <a href="http://tools.veloc-it.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="VelocIT tools and utilities">tools</a> site which is more appropriate to our needs).<br>I think there is precedent for Microsoft choosing the right technology for the right market. Why doesn't the Zune use Windows Mobile? It was a conscious decision, noting that for this particular market, it was more important to use the right technology (whatever that may be) than try to showcase any particular Windows technology.</p>
