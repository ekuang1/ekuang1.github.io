message: <p>I'm too much of an optimist for my own good. ;)<br>But to clarify, <strong>if TFS could address the issues I brought up, then it wouldn't matter to me if they offered SVN hosting or not.</strong><br>In the end, I care less about the technology under the hood and more about whether the platform can do what I need it to do.<br>I'm only pushing SVN because it offers all these things now. It's theoretically possible that TFS could be updated to offer these things, but it sounds like that would require some deep architectural changes.<br>Not only that, why would Microsoft try and make TFS a good source control system for OSS development? That doesn't seem to be its target market. I'm not saying meeting the needs of an Enterprise market is necessarily at odds with OSS (I think SVN targets the enterprise market well), I just think that the dogfooding aspect of SVN's development style (the fact that it is developed via OSS) gives it an edge up in addressing the needs of the OSS community.<br>As I told Jeff in an IM conversation, if we could place a wager on this, I'd put a large bet that they never adopt SVN. However, I'd also hedge my bet by placing a tiny amount that they do. Since it's such a longshot, it'd be a nice payola if it worked out! ;)</p>
