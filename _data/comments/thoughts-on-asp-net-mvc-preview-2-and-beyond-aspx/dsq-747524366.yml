message: <p>Here are a couple of questions on MVC design.<br>1) Why are you using aspx and ascx controls, you have unneeded usercontrol code running in a new framework?<br>2) Since views can display form fields, why not have the view at least responsible for grabbing the post data as directed by the controller?</p>
