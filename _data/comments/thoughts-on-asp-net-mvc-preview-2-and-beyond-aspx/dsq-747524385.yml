message: <p>Personally I like to follow the builds, to see them progress and maybe throw in my two cents.<br>But as most of the other developers, I have to convince the decision makers (for obvious reasons) which are easier convinced when a new technology has an RTM build. <br>This said, I really enjoy this shift in releasing software at MS!</p>
