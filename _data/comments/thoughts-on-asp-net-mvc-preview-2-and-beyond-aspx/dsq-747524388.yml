message: <p>Hi,<br>I tried the new MVC release. Looks awesome. But I can't get the new MediaPlayer getting to work with the MVC approach (missing ScriptManager, which needs a form runat server). Because that would be the complete opposite of MVC, I can't see you you guys want to get that running. Are there any plans?<br>Thanks, Rainer</p>
