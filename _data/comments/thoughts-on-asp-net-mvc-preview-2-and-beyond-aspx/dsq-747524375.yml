message: "<p>Re: the RTM question<br>Thought I'd weigh in with what I've found in open-source projects where I'm a committer.<br>For the projects I've been involved with, the RTM designation has been important for initial adopters, while the available source worked better for those with familiarity.  By \"RTM\", in our projects the equivalent is an official version.<br>The version number has the \"signaling\" factor: check me out, i'm stable code, i've been given a stamp of approval, just follow the readme file and you should be up and running.<br>For our projects, many users on the mailing list ask about which set of revisions will be marked as officially versioned.  The reasons they provide are usually around confidence in the codebase, but a lot of it is just creature comfort of dealing with a stake in the ground.<br>For us, any version designation is of code that has been available in trunk source for quite a while, so for many of us the decision is more administrative than anything else, and certainly anti-climactic.  Just the nature of our projects, where we encourage more iteration by vetting incremental updates to the source code, as opposed to more whole-hog collective evaluation of an official version.<br>In relation to the MVC project, it would seem to depend on overall project progress, the timeliness and breadth of incremental updates, and relation of the RTM revisions to the trunk revisions.<br>On the notion of churn, increasing the incremental updates to the trunk source cuts down the (real or perceived) churn factor.  Communication of what's stable vs. what's likely to change is important, but the code will speak louder than any words.  Speeding up the development process (more bites, more meals vs. buffet style) helps a lot in this respect.<br>FWIW, hope this helps.</p>"
