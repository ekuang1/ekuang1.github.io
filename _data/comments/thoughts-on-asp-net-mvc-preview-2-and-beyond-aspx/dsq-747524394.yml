message: "<p>Is Legacy MVC Preview 2 an oxymoron?<br><br><br><br>So I'm doing some work with <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/Kigg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.codeplex.com/Kigg\">Kigg</a> a Digg-like clone built on MVC. It was built on MVC Preview 2 and not compatible with Preview 3 (thread <a href=\"http://dotnetslackers.com/Community/forums/compatible-with-mvc-preview-release-3/p/2202/27587.aspx#27587\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://dotnetslackers.com/Community/forums/compatible-with-mvc-preview-release-3/p/2202/27587.aspx#27587\">here</a>)<br><br><br><br>So I looked for a download of the binaries and they are no longer available (link in body of initial post of this thread is broken) so I downloaded the source from <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=11833\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=11833\">Codeplex</a>, compiled it and it works locally, but when I deploy to my server I'm getting a complaint about the assemblies I compiled:<br><br><br><br>Could not load file or assembly 'System.Web.Routing' or one of its dependencies. Strong name signature could not be verified. The assembly may have been tampered with, or it was delay signed but not fully signed with the correct private key.
