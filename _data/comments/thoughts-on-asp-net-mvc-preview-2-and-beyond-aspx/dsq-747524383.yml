message: <p>For me personally it's all about the source code right now. I know that it's obviously a big shift for you guys to do any work as open source, but at the moment - it isn't. Until it is and that starts to work in a visible fashion it's very difficult for me to know how confident I can be in pushing this forward as a viable avenue for development.<br>That's not an issue of free software zealotry in this case, it's a pragmatic view for the business. It's not possible for me to gauge what level of effort will be required in building software on a framework that I expect to modify and extend without source. No matter how good the eventual 1.0 is, I can say for sure that it will need to be extended for our uses. So planning around doing so with no visibility is a risk that pushes me down the path of an alternate product or creating an in-house solution (and that would clearly not benefit the community in the latter case, something I would very much like to happen).<br>Anyway. I'm looking forward to seeing the source and hopefully some information around the post release environment - will it be developed in an open fashion? Will you be accepting community based improvements and fixes?</p>
