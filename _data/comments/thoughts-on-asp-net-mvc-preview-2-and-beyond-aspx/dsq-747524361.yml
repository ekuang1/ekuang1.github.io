message: <p>Phil,<br>I understand your point of view (as you explained in MIX) that it is a lot of effort that goes into releasing an RTM. Having the option to look at the source code and make changes to it, if needed, helps. But having an RTM even if it is not feature-rich is useful.... one to convince the management that we don't have a beta product in production and secondly to understand which pieces may go major revamping. <br>Ideally it would be nice to have the RTM at the earliest possible ... and then access to source code on Codeplex should be helpful to get an idea about upcoming features/changes. If I think something in there is really worthwhile, I can take the risk and go for that.<br>- Swapna</p>
