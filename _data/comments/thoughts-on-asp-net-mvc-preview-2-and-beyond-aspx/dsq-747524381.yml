message: <p>I'm definitely in the camp favoring a signal when we've crossed the churn curve versus a definite RTM.  Late, breaking changes should only be in the case of critical flaws and not to refactor for kicks... we know there will be a 2.0 and it's okay that it's more refined... just make sure 0.8 -&gt; 1.0 are as consistent as possible.<br>-Matt</p>
