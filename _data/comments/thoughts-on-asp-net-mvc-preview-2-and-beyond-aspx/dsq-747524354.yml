message: "<p>Hi Phil,<br>in the last days I played around a bit with MVC P2 and I'm glad you are already addressing the issues around the RedirectToAction and ControllerContext:<br>I wrote my small testing method here:<br><a href=\"http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2008/03/10/Playing-with-testing-ASP.NET-MVC-P2.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2008/03/10/Playing-with-testing-ASP.NET-MVC-P2.aspx\">http://codeclimber.net.nz/.../Playing-with-testing-ASP.NET-MVC-P2.aspx</a><br>Talking about RTM... personally I'd not care about it that much, as long as at some point the framework has a clear and well-defined architecture so that it is declared as \"released\" in the sense that you take all the precautions typical of a new release when moving to the next code drop: make things deprecated before dropping them, keep breaking changes to the minimum, not changing the overall architecture, and so on<br>At the moment you can't say we are at this stage since a lot of thing need to be cleaned up.<br>And more again, speaking about my personal desiderata, I'd like to see a System.Mvc.Testing.dll that contains some pre-baked specific testing helpers like a TestViewEngine.<br>Keep up the good work.<br>PS: will you ever have time to chat about next Subtext release? ;-)<br></p>"
