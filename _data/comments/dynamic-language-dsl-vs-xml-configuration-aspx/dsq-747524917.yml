message: "<p>One reason I think XML has been used the way is has in languages like Java/C# is because it provides a way to offer dynamic features without recompiling. XSLT is one example where you can conceivably add a huge amount of functionality and effectively script an application. This is slightly different from configuration, but the essence is the same. <br>You don't see the same kind if issues with dynamic language often because the data structures are more flexible and convenient to write. I think this is partly why JSON is such a popular format. It allows a simple and relatively intuitive means of describing what would have originated in configuration object/hash/array/etc. <br>If you consider the difference between:<br><code><br>my_options = { 'root-url': 'http://example.com/app',<br>               'db-uri' : 'mysql:///localhost:5432/app' }<br></code><br>With something like this:<br><code><br>HashTable configHash = new HastTable({ <br>    'root-url': 'http://example.com/app',<br>    'db-uri' : 'mysql:///localhost:5432/app' <br>});<br></code><br>I this it becomes a little clearer how XML could be considered helpful for configuration.<br>With that said, I try my best to avoid XML in configuration scenarios. In Python there is ConfigObj along with YAML that makes for much kinder configuration.</p>"
