message: "<p>You are ENTIRELY correct with your philosophy on configuration!  Of course, I'm just saying that because I'm in complete agreement with you. :)<br>However, IMHO, you should never ever release code that is Configuration Fodder (TM) that doesn't have the configuration component available for it.  I was rather taken aback to see how Routes are expected to be constructed for MVC, gasping wildly while opening the Global.asax. :o  Routes should totally be defined in configuration, and you're setting a poor example/practice by providing sample code otherwise, (IMHO :D).<br>In fact, I would take this one step further by saying you should never release code that doesn't have configuration *AND* configuration DESIGN support for it.  <br>That is: Code First, Configuration Second, AND Design Third!<br>Aren't we getting a little old to muck around in xml files? :)<br>Enterprise Library is a great implementation of this process.  Sure, it might be a bloated base, but their Code--&gt;Configuration--&gt;Design Support paradigm is SPOT ON(!!!), and all Microsoft products should follow this methodology for their products.<br>We should never have to touch XML, just the GUI to construct it. :) <br>Anyways, great blog.  You have a new subscriber!</p>"
