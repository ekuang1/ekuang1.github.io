message: <p>C# *is* my primary language. Love it, hate it, it works for me, and I use it every day. Will continue to do this until it goes away. I am however a proponent of opening myself up to new stuff, and find Ruby to be very sexy and useful.<br>DSLs hands down over XML. It's the difference between night and day. EntLib 3 has done a great job of hiding the ugliness of editing app.config and it's the right way to do it. However, it's still xml behind the scenes and fallible. Almost every project I use EL3 on needs some hand editing love from time to time.<br>I would love to see EntLib4 (probably too late) or EntLib5 to have a Ruby DSL as the input/output mechanism for it's configuration. Keep the GUI designer interface built into Visual Studio, just change the stream.<br>DSLs are 100x more intent revealing and while I may not even look at the configuraiton file, knowing it's there in a form that I can understand without reams of documentation is a huge bonus, especially to maintenance developers. As it is right now, I'm looking at sending 3 or 4 2.0 apps built with EntLib 2.x to maintenance which means I have to give them a course in understanding the XML nodes that are valid and what they mean.<br>A DSL that describes itself is the self-documenting panacea that XML touted itself to be. I have yet to see any XML file I can understand (except for the most basic) but I've never met a DSL I didn't like.</p>
