message: <p>Phil I think this is one of those cases where we have become so used to the data == code mentality that we sometimes forget the usefulness of letting end users manipulate the data - whether in the raw form or through some other editing tool.  It is so much more efficient to change a single line in a config file than it is to change a line of code and recompile.  Moore's law has lulled us into a false sense that the performance hit from JIT compilation is negligible.  Anyone who has ever been the first to hit an ASP.Net site after an app recycle will tell you otherwise.<br>Also, we should not forget that Admins != Coders and our system designs (and the underlying APIs which help shape those designs) should reflect this fact.  Asking an Admin to change a config file or edit a database record is far easier than requiring them to change a line of code and recompile.<br>The MVC team is making a good decision to make sure that features like URL routing are testable but I think you still need to make sure that those same features are configurable at runtime since the people usually desiring to change those routes are not going to be comfortable with a code editor.</p>
