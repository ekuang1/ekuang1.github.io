message: "<p>It's definitely a nice little thing that the .NET team did here.<br>However, you should be aware of one caveat.  If you implement IDisposable on your structure explicitly, then it will result in your structure being boxed.<br>Juval Lowy has a chapter in his book \"Programming .NET Components, 2nd Edition\" which describes it in detail (disclosure: I know Juval, and did the technical editing on this book).</p>"
