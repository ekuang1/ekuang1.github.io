message: <p>This specific blog is pretty workable on the old blackberry 7290. <br>That said, I think that developing a stripped down mobile version makes sense for a number of reasons. First, there is the page size thing. Second, and larger imho, is that mobile surfing is far different from normal surfing. You do it in different places, under different time constraints and with different concerns. Furthermore the ui is vastly different. Try navigating pages only using tab and shift-tab and you will get the idea of how navigation on a blackberry can feel. Mobile browsing really is a different application and cannot quite be handled with css alone.</p>
