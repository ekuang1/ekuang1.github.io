message: <p>Hello Haack ... Yes it was nice ...  I enjoyed it ... and to be frankly ... I don't believe in your undergraduate-only experience ... :D  ... I have Ms. in Physics (of course it was 9 years ago and specialization Physics with Computer Science ) but it I had no string theory course  and the level of your article is for sure at the last years of University ...</p><p>And of course ... the guys at  Numberphile were proving some Physics math I think not so useful for real hardcore Mathematicians ... :D</p>
