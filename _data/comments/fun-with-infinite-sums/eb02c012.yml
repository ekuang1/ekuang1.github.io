  It is a great article. I just wanted to point out three things:



  1. The magic number -1/12 is attributed to legendary Indian mathematician Ramanujan not Polchinski



  2. You need to apply gamma function to Reimann zeta function to transform the Euler series



  3. You need to calculate Basel value. This technique is called solving for Basel problem in order to to get the final value of -1/12
