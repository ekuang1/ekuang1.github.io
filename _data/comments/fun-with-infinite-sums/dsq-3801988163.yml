message: <p>If the number of elements in the set is uncountably infinite, then there is no longer a summation to be made, since one cannot sum over an uncountably infinute number of objects. One can perform integration over the function which returns a value for any number within the uncountable set, but this would represent an scenario completely different from the one on the joke.</p>
