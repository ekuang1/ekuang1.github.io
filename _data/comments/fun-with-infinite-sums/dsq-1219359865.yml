message: "<p>Great post. As a mathematician, it's good to see that most people aren't taking that video too seriously. One change I'd suggest on your definition of a series. While we think of it as the \"sum of the sequence,\" we infact don't have a way to add an infinite number of things (at least under the normal ZFC setup). Instead, think of a series as a sequence itself, with each value representing the partial sum from i = 0 to n. Then the series converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums converges. Cheers!</p><p>EDIT: Here's the Wikipedia page that explains it well - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a></p><p>I also bring it up, because when you define an infinite series this way, it's pretty clear that 1+2+3+... is not -1/12. It's important to note that infinite sums aren't just adding things up, and that you do need the tools from analysis (mainly limits with epsilons and Ns in this case) to actually \"do\" this kind of math. At that point, it's pretty clear that some hackery is going on.</p>"
