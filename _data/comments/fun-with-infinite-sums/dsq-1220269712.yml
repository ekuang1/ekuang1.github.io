message: "<p>&gt; Another point: In math you can define whatever axioms you want, but if they contradict the physical laws in our universe then they are pretty useless (only of theoretical value).</p><p>I agree with the first part, but disagree with the second part. Much of mathematics has no analog to the physical world but it doesn't necessarily make it useless. Sometimes the techniques employed to arrive at results are interesting and useful.</p><p>Also, even if you define a set of axioms, they have to be non-contradicting and you can't switch axioms midstream. :)</p>"
