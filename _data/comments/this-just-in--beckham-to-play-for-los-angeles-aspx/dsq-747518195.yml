message: <p>He sure is good at swinging the balls in but he was NEVER a top player of his own. He is a good team player and delivers good balls and scores freekicks THATS ALL.<br>So to all those who are exited about see him play do not expect anyway special at all. He is famous for many reasons apart from football too, but he has NEVER won the FIFA best player of the year and will never win that as he will need individual skills which he never had.<br>But he sure is a marketable guy and will be a good life for LA thats for sure.</p>
