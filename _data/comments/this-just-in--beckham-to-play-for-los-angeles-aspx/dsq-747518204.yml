message: <p>I don't get it - the L.A. Galaxy has Â£128m to pay Beckham to turn up and they are <i>struggling</i> in MLS? Yikes. Rumours today include that Beckham will draw more of his madrid teammates over to MLS - Zidane, Figo, Ronaldo - to close out their twilight years. Sounds like Pele and crew in the 70s. <br>Still, those four would cost more than an entire lower division over here in England. Whoever owns the Galaxy better hope he gets it right. He should hire Vinny Jones too for some entertainment.</p>
