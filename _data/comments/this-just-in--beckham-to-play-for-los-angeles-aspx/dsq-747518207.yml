message: <p>He's still a very good player.  The vast majority of clubs in England and Europe would have loved to have signed him if they could have afforded him.  I just hope he's making the move for the right reasons, and not just for the large pile of cash.  He's arguably the only player with the potential to give MLS such a massive lift.  He mightn't be terribly intelligent, but he comes across as a nice and genuine guy.  As long as his idiot wife stays in the background, both LA Galaxy and MLS have got themselves a wonderful signing!</p>
