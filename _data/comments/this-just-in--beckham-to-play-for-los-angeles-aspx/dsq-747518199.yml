message: "<p>@Damien: Yes, Americans *DO* play soccer!  Just not as well as the rest of the world, yet.<br>@Max: He doesn't need to be a top player individually. If he raises the level of his teammates with great passes, he'll make a big impact. I'm not expecting Ronaldinho action from him, I'm hoping to see the Galaxy start playing more beautiful soccer. We'll see.</p>"
