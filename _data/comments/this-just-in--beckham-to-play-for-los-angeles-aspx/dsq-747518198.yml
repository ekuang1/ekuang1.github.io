message: "<p>There's still some more good football left in those shoes, trust me. I'm saddened by this because I hoped FC Barcelona could hire him (I'm a Bar√ßa supporter!) and I like him: he's a good worker, a good team player and quite a good footballer. He's no Zidane, granted, but he's really good. <br>He's out of Madrid because Capello, Real Madrid's coach, simply don't like him and keeps him on the bench. I frankly dislike this Capello guy.</p>"
