message: <p>As someone who hails from Manchester and a commited Man U fan I have massive amount of respect for Becks. He's still the best deadball kicker in the world. Finishing his career in the US is the very best place for him, history dictates that the very best of footballers finish their playing careers there and we could very well see him back in the premiership coaching (my money is that some day he will return to Man U). Promoting football to younger ages is something that Becks believes in and he will be a massive boost to boosting the appeal of football to the American younger audience.</p>
