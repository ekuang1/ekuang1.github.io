message: <p>I think the (slightly veiled) reason for this move is to bring the game of football (NOT soccer, football without wimpy padding) to the heathen shores of america.<br>It's a good move because DB could be seen as an ambassador of world football. Of course no one else in the world is at all interested in 'american football' so they'd better get interested in what the rest of the world watch if they want to join in !<br>You never know, maybe rugby will become popular ? Do they have rugby in america ?</p>
