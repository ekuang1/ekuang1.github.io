message: <p>Tsk, this happens a lot to companies who call their Excel spreadsheets "databases", super-denormalized ones at that. My wife used to work for a shipping line and one aspect of her job was that when information regarding customers or consignees changes, they have to search through the whole spread sheet to apply the changes to each instance.<br>Talk about the potential for errors.</p>
