message: "<p>All good points. and yet...<br>The definition of \"Programming your system\" is ever-changing.<br>There's no clear distinction between Data and Code. So while users can enter data and this data is used to determine how code runs -- they are in effect programming the system.<br>Hence I think a more concise title for the base problem would be:<br>\"Allowing Users Is A Recipe For Disaster\"<br>I think the kind of in-built revision control mechanism that they have in wikipedia (for example) is the way forward in terms of bringing \"version-control\" to ordinary people.<br>And the difficulty is that implementing a system for lower-skilled users requires higher-skilled developers. <br>The emphasis is not on taking abilities away from users, but on implementing them in a way that allows for course corrections, dead easy revision control (and merging), easy auditing, usability, -- all those sort of things that look easy but aren't. <br>It's inevitable that these things are rare: because the end user doesn't realise the value of them until it's too late.<br>good food for thought today. another helping please.<br>lb</p>"
