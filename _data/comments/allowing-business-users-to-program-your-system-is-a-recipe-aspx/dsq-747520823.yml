message: "<p>&lt;p&gt;Well, I agree that version control is a good thing, and testing of course. But 7 steps which are manual steps, even if each such step invokes an automatic process, is, frankly, ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I tried to get some researchers and academics to use version control in developing a website, collaboratively. Given that most of them were used to Frontpage, presenting them with even the GUI based tools for CVS or Subversion was too much.  I never found a system that was simple enogh to use, fitted in with the Windows Metaphor sufficiently, and was easy to explain.  Now we have more flavours of version control (CVS, svn, darcs, git, rcs, ...) than you can shake a stick at, and I can't think of any that I'd consider presenting to a non-programmer.&lt;/p&gt;<br> &lt;p&gt;These things are important, so they should be easy to do.   And I don't mean easy for developers, I mean easy for people whose fear level is at: \"If I make a mistake, the computer will blow up like it does in the movies!\" And if you think I'm overstating the simplicity level, then why aren't more people using troff or LaTeX to produce documents?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think we need User Interface and design experts to wrap a decent Facade Pattern around these tools.&lt;/p&gt;</p>"
