message: "<p>Interesting that the commenters above never seem to have heard of Document Management Systems (DMS) such as DocsOpen.  They handle version control for documents at least as well as any software version control system. <br>I used to work for one of the large law firms in the City (of London).  Every single document (Word, Excel, Visio, whatever) was automatically added to DocsOpen when it was created.  It was not even possible to create or access a document outside the DMS since users did not have rights to view their own C: drives and the Office applications were heavily customized to lock them down.  <br>Not only did the DMS handle versioning, it also recorded every single time a document was accessed (not changed but accessed!), and by whom.  One IT guy I worked with got fired after the access logs showed he'd used his super-user privileges to look at restricted documents related to staff salaries.  <br>Access rights could be restricted in exactly the same way they can be with a software version control system (to individuals and/or to groups).  Rolling back a document was a breeze and it was even possible to fork a document or merge a fork back into the main branch (admittedly this functionality was limited).  The DMS also handled the situation where users were working off line and could seamlessly merge a modified local copy of a document back into the document repository.  <br>Show Differences (between different versions of a document) was far more precise than anything I've seen in IT.  Law firms need to be able to track changes to a document down to the character level (moving a comma can change the meaning of a legal document).  I still miss DeltaView (the application used by most major law firms world-wide to show differences) every time our crappy IT version control system tells me a whole line of code has changed when I add a single space or something.<br>Admittedly all this relates to law firms, not financial institutions.  From friends who worked in financial institutions in the City I know they have a totally different culture from law firms.  However, it's certainly not right that all non-IT companies are sloppy regarding version control.</p>"
