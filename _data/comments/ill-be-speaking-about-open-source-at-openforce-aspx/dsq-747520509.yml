message: <p>@Phil - Don't forget to throw in a "DotNetNuke Rocks!" every once in a while ;-)<br>As for the panels - we invited Phil and several other leaders in the .Net open source space to disuss their projects and open source on the .Net platform.  Of course DotNetNuke Corp. is footing the bill, and the attendees will mostly be DNN community members, so keeping the talks relevant to the audience is highly recommmended (wouldn't want Phil to get a bunch of 1's on the evals).  Scott Guthrie's panel will be a discussion of the general state of Open Source in .Net.  The other panel will be a discussion of common architectural problems that the various panelists face and how we chose to solve those problems in our open source projects.</p>
