message: <p>Good point Joe.  But that brings up the question of whether or not there is a formal MbUnit entity that I could transfer it to.<br>With DNN this question is easy.  The DNN Source code copyright belongs to Perpetual Motion Interactive Systems, as does the DNN trademark.<br>But looking at the license on the MbUnit site, it's not clear if I should transfer the domain to Jamie Carnsedale or Jonathan De Halleux.  I will talk to Andrew about this.</p>
