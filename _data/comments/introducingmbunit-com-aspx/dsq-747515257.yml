message: '<p>Very commendable Phil.  I would suggest one thing though:  Transfer the domain name to the mbUnit team.  Even if you "donate" the funds to purchase the name, the team would still have "control" of all assets needed to maintain the project.  The reason I suggest this is that DotNetNuke ran into problems when trying to protect our name from others.  Even linux has had trouble protecting the "Linux" trademark and name.  While I have no doubt about your intentions, the same cannot be said of everyone who might try to grab a domain name related to an OS project.  Just a thought.</p>'
