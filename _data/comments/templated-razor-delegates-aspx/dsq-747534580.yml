message: "<p>Taking templated Razor delegates a step further, I thought it would be really powerful if we could easily create UI components that provide several settings to customize its appearance and enable the user of the component to pass in multiple razor delegates that act as content templates.<br>To avoid having to pass all that into a list of arguments, one could obviously create a view model class and pass an instance into the templated razor function.<br>That would work. But it would be even nicer if we could use a fluent syntax describing our view model.<br>And taking that even a step further, you could go as far as resuing the view model in other projects (or even within the same project) using different partial views!<br>I started a small expeiment on this at codeplex: <a href=\"http://mvcviewcomponents.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://mvcviewcomponents.codeplex.com/\">http://mvcviewcomponents.codeplex.com/</a><br>The idea is that we speak in terms of ViewComponents, rather than HTML helpers. The core library enables developers to build a rich set of UI components, using things like inheritance &amp; redistribution of the components (much like the Telerik MVC suite, only now we open up a framework, paving the way for a concept like ViewComponents).<br>I'm curious on other people's thoughts on this.</p>"
