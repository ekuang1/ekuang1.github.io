message: <p>I've been running as a limited user for about a year and MakeMeAdmin has been extremely valuable, but you need to be careful when installing applications and updates that require a reboot. I've discovered quite a few that continue the installation process after I logon and fail miserably if I logon with an LUA account after rebooting.<br>It is a major pain in the ass initially until you learn how to work around applications that attempt to open HKLM in read/write mode to read a key or that attempt to write to files in the Program Files folder.<br>Overall, I'm pleased with the results and (perhaps it is my imagination) it seems my system remains stable for longer periods of time. Windows Vista has features that makes running as LUA easier (e.g. shadowing registry entries), but I think Microsoft took the wrong approach by popping up logon dialogs at every turn.<br>What really concerns me with Vista is that it becomes a bit too rote to enter a password when prompted without realizing why we are asked to do so, and the password dialog doesn't contain enough information to make it clear.</p>
