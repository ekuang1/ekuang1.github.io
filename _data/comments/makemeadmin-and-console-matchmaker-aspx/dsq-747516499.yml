message: <p>Windows Update behaves in a strange way when all you want is to download the updates, but install later. Many smaller nice-to-haves fails in strange ways. I don't like to use my account to run ASP.NET, just so I can debug; I want to use the same type of account as used in production. It was a pain in the behind to install everything on my new laptop.<br>But I really like a writeup from those of you who made it, so I can learn what to do. Unless you aren't too lazy, erh, too busy :-)</p>
