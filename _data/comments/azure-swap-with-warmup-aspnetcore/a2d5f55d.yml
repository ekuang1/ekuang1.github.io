  @Rasmus thanks for the tip!



  @Rando that won't work for me. I'm trying to set up an auto-swap. As part of the auto-swap, Azure will do the following steps:



  1. Apply production settings to the staging deployment slot

  2. Send the ping request to ensure it's warmed up and that it returns a 200 status code (per my settings).

  3. If the ping request returns 200, it'll swap otherwise it won't.



  So I could have my pipeline make the warmup request after deployment, but that wouldn't guarantee that it's done before Azure does the auto-swap. I need Azure to make that request and wait for a 200 status code to be sure.
