  I only hit this issue if the redirect rule was specified in the web.config, which is mentioned in the troubleshooting guide https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots#troubleshoot-swaps



  Not seen the issue when HTTPS only is configured in the TLS/SSL settings.
