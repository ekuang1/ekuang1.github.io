message: <p>I am still surprised at not seeing complete mentions of semantics of the called method, only a vague reference to its signature, is that enough?<br>What if you require certain assertions to hold on the returned value prior to calling the method, e.g, you require a "quack" that is guaranteed to return a 5-letter string? Is that part of the "like a duck" in your title?</p>
