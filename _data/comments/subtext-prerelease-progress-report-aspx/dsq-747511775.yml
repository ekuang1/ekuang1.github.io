message: <p>Hi<br><br><br><br>I agree with you in that we need an open source project which enhances .Text purely as a blogging web app. However, I wonder, why not DasBlog ? is it because it stores its data as xml files ?<br><br><br><br>Many times I have been tempted to write my own blogging engine in Asp.Net it never materialised as I don't blog that much myself.<br><br><br><br>It would be really interesting to see how Subtext evolves. I'll definitely be watching it and deploy it if I feel comfortable enough.</p>
