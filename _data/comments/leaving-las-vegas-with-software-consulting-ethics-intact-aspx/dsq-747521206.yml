message: <p>I agree that you did the right thing, though I'd have taken it one better and notified the other company's management that their employee was attempting to steal from them. That extra step carries some very real risk with it because many are happy living in denial and exposing the creep will set off a stink bomb--some of which can spatter your way. Still, keeping the consequences of bad behavior small only serves to delay, not prevent, it happening again.</p>
