message: <p>@Jacob - I thought about it, but didn't want to take it that far. This person was someone who was sort of a coworker before (long story), so I felt a slight degree of loyalty in that respect.<br>We simply told him we didn't feel comfortable with the job because it was effectively a kickback and didn't want to partake in any unethical dealings.<br>We left it to him to take that message and hopefully make better decisions in the future.<br>We found out later that he owed "an associate" a *lot* of money hence the urgency to do business this way. This only served to convince us even more we wanted to stay the hell out.</p>
