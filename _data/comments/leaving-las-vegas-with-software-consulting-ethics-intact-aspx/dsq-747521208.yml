message: <p>In 1998 I was a third party contractor developing a product for online recruiting. It was myself, the primary contractor and someone we agreed to hire to take care of the html grunt work. Based on our initial 5 month effort, for which we were paid $60K total, that company raised between $8M and $13M in venture capital (the reports vary, but they all fall within that range). They also agreed to pay us an additional $55K for additional programming / effort that we had put in over those 5 months. After their second venture capital fund raising event (1998 - the money was FLOWING), they "hired" one of their VC contributors - who was a high powered CTO for a Fortune 500 company, who had set up another company with the CEO of the company we were doing the development work for, as a partner. They then fired us, squelched on the $55K they agreed to pay us (actually they dared us to get lawyers because now they had MILLION$ to battle us with), and started channeling all the development through the newly formed company. Fast forward to 2000, the company ran through their $8M to $13M in financing (in "development" costs no doubt) and the company folds. I later (2001 or so) ran into a fella that worked for the company and he told me that the CEO had folded the company, but he was a $MILLIONAIRE$ and that he just bought a new mansion. His reputation was shot, but frankly, he was probably laughing all the way to the bank.<br>It seems we've all had our run-ins. :)</p>
