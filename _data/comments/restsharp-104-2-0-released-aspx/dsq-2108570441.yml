message: "<p>I have to agree. I've spent hours (and scoured Stack Overflow) trying to call a third-party API that expects a Content-Type header on GET requests. HttpClient considers this a protocol violation and will NOT let you do it. I plan to try RestSharp.</p><p>Edit: RestSharp worked great, and was significantly easier to use than HttpClient.</p>"
