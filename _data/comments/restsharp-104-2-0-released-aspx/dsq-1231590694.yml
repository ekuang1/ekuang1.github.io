message: <p>So is it still safe to use it for new projects, or should we search for something else, e.g. like the here mentioned speakeasy (<a href="https://github.com/jonnii/speakeasy)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/jonnii/speakeasy)">https://github.com/jonnii/s...</a> which seems not to be abandoned, but still doesn't look as mature as RESTSharp?</p>
