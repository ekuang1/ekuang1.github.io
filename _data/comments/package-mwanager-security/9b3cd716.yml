  Another solution is updating packages rarely (like every 3 month). That way there is a smaller time window in which an attack is possible.



  It seems quite ridiculous to me that these days many people let their build servers pull *arbitrary binaries* from internet sources and deploy them top production. The whole methodology is fundamentally insecure. Why is nobody noticing this?



  I worked with a financial software company which banned NuGet because of this. (This was a mistake - this should have allowed NuGet but updated rarely and vetted the updates).



  Unfortunately, the whole .NET ecosystem has gone package crazy. There are daily updates with unimportant changes and dependency hell forces you to update everything at once essentially. It's terrible.



  Besides the security issues all of this creates a lot of work for little in return.
