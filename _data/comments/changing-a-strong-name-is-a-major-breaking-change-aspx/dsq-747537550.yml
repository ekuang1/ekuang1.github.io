message: <p>Thank you for that!<br>This has been a major nuisance for several of our projects, and we were initially blaming NuGet, having to resort to manual package installation.<br>I think NuGet is putting to much trust into developers to correctly use version numbers to identify breaking changes. It wouldn't be unwise to specifically ask if a version upgrade is desired, rather than automatically upgrading packages with same major version.</p>
