message: <p>Just to expand on my earlier comment:-<br>IMHO, several mistakes have been made here<br>1) changing the strong name - I've read the justification and I find it difficult to agree with<br>2) only incrementing the patch version - according to SemVer the version should have been 2.0.0. I can understand reluctance to increment the major version (for marketing reasons, etc.) but if a decision is taken not to do this, then I think, as a compromise, at least the minor version should have been incremented, i.e. 1.3.0, just to indicate that this is not just a patch but contains actual changes. Note that by not incrementing the major version, log4net have effectively chosen NOT to follow SemVer (a choice they are free to make).<br>3) the nuget package version should not have diverged from the product version (if the 1.3.0 compromise had been used then the nuget package could also have just incremented to 1.3.0). This doesn't follow SemVer, but it reflects log4net's decision not to follow SemVer. I don't see the point in forcing SemVer in nuget for a product that doesn't use SemVer itself - this will only cause confusion.<br>I think the situation we are left in now is quite undesirable and I think the nuget version and product version <em>should</em> be aligned. However, the nuget package is now locked into being &gt; 2.0.0 which means an alignment of the versions can only happen if log4net moves to 2.0.0 itself.<br>I guess another solution would be to <em>delete</em> the 2.0.0 nuget package (by nuget gallery admin) and release 1.3.0 , apologising for the inconvenience caused to anyone who has already updated to the 2.0.0 package. Given the age of the package (~24 hours) this may be a feasible solution. Of course, if a decision could be made to use the <em>old</em> key package for nuget, then this could be pushed as 1.2.12 since the strong name change would effectively be backed out.</p>
