message: <p>Great post, Phil.  These are the conversations I think we all need to have regardless of what "trimester" we are in.  If we are to really change our world, we will see that each generation has much to contribute and we can find one another through our common humanity.  I am in my third trimester and I feel better than ever I did, I'm happier and more dedicated to my own growth as well as that of others.  Keep on keeping on folks.  It's worth it!!!!</p>
