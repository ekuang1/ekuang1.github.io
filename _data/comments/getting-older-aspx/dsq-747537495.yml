message: <p>Speaking as a fellow geezer, may I ask for you or your fellow githubblers (something something glasses, lenses, telescopes) to start a github VS extension?  I like the Git SCC extension, but c'mon, bring the whole experience into the IDE!  github is more than just source control, after all :)</p>
