message: <p>I dont code for free.  I have to feed my family and prepare for retirement.  I dont understand anything having to do with free.  If people want free, they get it from me while volunteering to build houses, help homeless, etc.  I dont do my job/career for free.  <br>I cant imagine asking my power company or cell phone provider to do what they do, for free.  :-)   Can I have a free month or two of power?  Lets say July and August.  Please?   Dont think so.</p>
