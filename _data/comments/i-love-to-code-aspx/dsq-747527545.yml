message: <p>My sentiments exactly.  I LOVE TO CODE.   My friends make fun of me because when we are out drinking and at the end of the night when I have establish a nice buzz, I would say something like "I wish I had my laptop. I feel like coding".<br>I LOVE IT.  I will do it for free and on my free time.  But luckily, we all get paid a lot of money to do what we love.  It's kind of like an artist or an athlete, they pay you to have fun.</p>
