message: <p>I think this is just as true for programming as it is for every other profession. The best trial lawyers are the ones who love to debate even when they are not in the courtroom. The best basketball players are the ones who play pickup games for fun. Passion for your field drives you to always be getting better at it, regardless of whether there are any incentives. Plus, when you spend your "free time" doing the same thing that you do at your job, it effectively gives you twice as much experience as those who are just doing it 8 to 5.</p>
