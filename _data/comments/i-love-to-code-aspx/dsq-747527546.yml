message: <p>This is all so true.  My co-workers, friends and I always talk about how important passion is in this career.  It became such as subject  that I gave a talk on it at our user group (Inland Empire .Net User Group in Southern California - <a href="http://www.iedotnetug.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.iedotnetug.org">www.iedotnetug.org</a>).  It was more of an involved discussion and we had a lot of great feedback from everyone who attended.<br>If anyone here is interested you can grab the slides from my web page (<a href="http://mattpenner.info/speaking-events/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mattpenner.info/speaking-events/">http://mattpenner.info/speaking-events/</a>) or our user group in the Downloads section (<a href="http://www.iedotnetug.org/UG/downloads.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.iedotnetug.org/UG/downloads.aspx">http://www.iedotnetug.org/UG/downloads.aspx</a>).<br>I love this stuff and I wouldn't be in any other career.  On a recent long project (12+ hour days for about a week) I told my wife, "It's a good thing I love what I do!"  Most days are 8 hours, which is a good thing because we also have 2 little boys at home and a daughter on the way.  <br>Keep posting those pics of your kids! :)</p>
