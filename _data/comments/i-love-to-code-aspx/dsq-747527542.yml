message: <p>@mike<br>I don't do my job for free either. I work 40-50 hours every week as a programmer, and you bet I expect to get paid for it. As Phil said in the post, "I donâ€™t think Joel meant to imply that programmers would continue to write code for their current employers for free in lieu of any pay." The point is that when I am deciding what to do with my free time, outside of my job, more often than not what I end up doing is coding, because that's what I love to do, whether I am getting paid for it or not.</p>
