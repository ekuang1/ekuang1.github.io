message: <p>Yes, I also love to code for the hell of it, but lately with a baby on the way and all those amazing RPG games (Fallout 3, Oblivion, Mass Effect, etc.), I find myself coding less for fun than usual.<br>That and the open source community has ballooned, in the 90s I had to write my own apps and utilities to make my life easier, now you just Google it, someone around the globe probably made the app or utility already.<br></p>
