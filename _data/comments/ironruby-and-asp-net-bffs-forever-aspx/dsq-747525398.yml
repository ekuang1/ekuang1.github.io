message: <p>Excuse the potentially dumb question but, to a C# developer like me, what are the benefits of using IronRuby? Would you use it in addition to C# (/VB) within the same app because it's easier to do some stuff with it? Or is it just an alternative language that will entice/enable Ruby developers to use the .Net framework?</p>
