message: <p>I don't understand something. Ruby is a dynamic language, you could change a class at runtime. Surely that is not possible in the CLR. It's probably possible in the DLR, but I don't know how to get the DLR (other than implictly with Silverlight). So how do you get ASP.NET to run ruby code? <br>*confused*</p>
