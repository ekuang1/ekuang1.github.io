message: "<p>My upgrade to v1.5 didn't went as smooth as I had hoped. <br>We are using Subtext as our internal blogging platform and have integrated this with our Windows auth model. Subtext 1.0 worked fine by changing the configs to use windows auth. Subtext 1.5 stopped working.<br>I did some investigation and discovered that the following line has changed which caused this to break.<br>return IsInRole(\"Admins\") || StringHelper.AreEqualIgnoringCase(CurrentUserName, Config.CurrentBlog.UserName);<br>This is in Subtext.Framework/Securiy.cs, line 273 (in the v1.0 codebase).<br>In the v1.5 codebase this line has been reduced to: <br>return IsInRole(\"Admins\");<br>My guess is that since we are not using the ASP.NET forms auth model, but rather the Windows auth model (and maybe even because our database originates from the dottext timeframe), the roles definition can't be found.<br>Can you please advice on what would be the best way to fix this in order to be able to seemlessly upgrade to future versions?<br>You can contact me at waseem@sadiq.nl <br>Thanks again for taking the time to develop such a fine product.<br>- Waseem</p>"
