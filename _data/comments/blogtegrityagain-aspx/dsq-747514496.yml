message: <p>Maybe I'm just an a-hole though. ;)<br>Actually, my post wasn't a direct response to you since, after I thought about it, I figured that you weren't being manipulated. I'd never seen anything like that on your blog before. It was more an outpouring of distress at the current state of the blogowhatsit. I see the marketers, PR folk, and "evangelists" talking about the best way to manipulate people and trick them into having a "conversation" (instead of a "sales pitch"). The viral stuff is the worst of all. It used to at least be clever, a funny movie or image. Now they just put up a web page with "coming soon" and send the link to a bunch of well trafficked blogs. Then they, predictibly, post about it. People link to the popular blog hoping for some traffic juice, everyone speculates and it's really all a bunch of crap. I trimmed out a bunch of blogs from my aggregator, a lot of A listers, because they just weren't saying anything I wanted to hear. I didn't make a big post talking about who I dropped and why mainly because it would have given them what they wanted, attention. I'm more interested in people MAKING technology than people TALKING about technology. Which is ironic because I haven't had a really technical post in a long time on my site.<br>It's also part of the reason I haven't posted much lately. Trying to post more original stuff rather than pointing at others marketing efforts or piggybacking and saying "me too".<br>I mean, look at the <a href="http://on10.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="on10.net">on10.net</a>. Why should I be interested? It's movies of ex-G4TV personalities, and not even the ones I thought were genuine to begin with. (a'la TWIT). It doesn't tell me anything about the product, yet I'm supposed to be excited. <a href="http://Oragami.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Oragami.com">Oragami.com</a> or whatever didn't do anything for me either. Maybe I'm just not excited by technology anymore? No it's not that. I'm ecxcited by Ozzies web clipboard concept and a lot of the Javascript development (Atlas, DoJo, Prototype, etc...). I just don't want Marketers and talking heads telling me what's cool anymore.</p>
