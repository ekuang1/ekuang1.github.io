message: <p>The Start Menu is actually a bad example of Fitt's Law.  When it was first implemented in Win95, the bottom row of pixels on the toolbar WASN'T RECOGNIZED as part of the "Start" button.  Only in recent versions of Windows did they hack it to make the mouse jump up a little to hit the button (try it and see).</p>
