message: "<p>And don't forget \"The Rock's\" (yes, the wrestler) law:  \"Know your role and shut your hole!\"<br>Put another way, don't overstep the bounds of your role in the (development) process when you have yet to attain any semblance of perfection, or even solid competency, in your own role.<br>Nothing chaps my @$$ more than the business analyst attempting GUI design when their analysis skills both are lacking and they refuse to get better at them.  Or even admit that they are lacking in them.  And to boot, their GUI skills are completely non-existent (i.e., no prior experience or education, just opinions).  But they \"want to get into GUI development\" to prove their worth elsewhere because at heart, they know they suck at analysis (or are just bored with it, probably because they suck at it, but needed a job).</p>"
