message: "<p>Sorry to contribute to this, but...<br></p><blockquote>How many Firefox users look at the code? A tiny tiny amount. And yet even then bugs slip through. Sometimes big gaping security bugs.</blockquote><p><br>Neither you nor I know how many users read the Firefox source, but I can tell you this much: it is more than the amount of people who read the source of any proprietary browsers. Similarly the amount of bugs the users fix is greater than zero, which is more than can be said for the proprietary browsers as well.<br>Now of course they are not perfect, and Firefox is hardly the best application by any standard. However it is just good enough to be useful and popular to quite a few people, some of them smart programmers with time to read the source and fix bugs they stumble upon themselves.<br>No one's saying it's a silver bullet that will cure all your ailments. If anyone says that about anything you should be cautious about believing them, software or otherwise. It happens to work very well for some projects, that's all.</p>"
