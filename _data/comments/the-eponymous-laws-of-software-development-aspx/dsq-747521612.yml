message: "<p>LOL!! Great post!<br>I'd like to add the old DP (Data Drocessing) Law of System Delivery -<br>\"Double your estimate and replace with next unit of time\". For example: original estimate: 6 weeks. Double: 12 weeks. Next unit of time: 12months. <br>This law still works all the time in Corporate IT!<br></p>"
