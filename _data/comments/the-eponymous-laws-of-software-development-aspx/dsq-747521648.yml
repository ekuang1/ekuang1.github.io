message: <p>Nice list.<br>At the risk of ruining a good joke, the Peter Principle isn't about promoting incompeten{ts|ce}, it's about putting people into positions that match their abilities.  Dilbert and The Office are funny, but have little or nothing to do with the principle.<br>(Could be I'm defensive due to my name though. :)</p>
