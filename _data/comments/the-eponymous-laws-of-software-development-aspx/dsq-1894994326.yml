message: <p>Hi Phil, thanks for the interesting posting. We are currently looking into Url Rewriting on an ASP.Net 2.0 based website. After reading this post I am considering using the Routing engine as it seems a much nicer, cleaner <a href="http://serprecord.filmrally.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://serprecord.filmrally.com/">solution</a>. So the question is, can we use the required dll's with ASP.Net 2.0?</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Tim</p>
