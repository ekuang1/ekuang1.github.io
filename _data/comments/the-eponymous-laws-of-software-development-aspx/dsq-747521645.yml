It doesn't state how many eyeballs will be enough for a given bit of software.<br>That's the thing about good laws: they limit themselves to accurately describing one true principle. They don't cover all the logical consequences of that principle and its interactions with other principles; that's left as an exercise for the reader.</p>"
