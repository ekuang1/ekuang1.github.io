message: <p>Appologies for being dragged into the "Many Eyeballs" thing... <br>I think you will find (if you read _The Cathedral and The Bazaar_ by Eric S Raymond), that this refers to identifying the causes of known problems - not to finding bugs.  So the fact that Firefox has bugs does not disprove the law, rather the measure of the law would be the time between a bug being identified by a user and the cause of the bug being understood by _a_ developer.  <br>... I only post this because I realise that it _is_ of earth-shattering significance.  Also because I wouldn't want anyone to be deprived of enjoying my own sense of self-importance.<br>Great post and great comments (until this one).  <br> - AJ ;)<br>&gt;&lt;&gt;<br></p>
