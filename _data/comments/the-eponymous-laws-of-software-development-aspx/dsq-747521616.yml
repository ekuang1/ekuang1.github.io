It should be <em>Given enough eyeballs connected to people who understand and who want to look for problems, understand the problems and can hold onto the entire system in their head, all bugs are shallow.</em>.<br></p><p>I've always found the proclaimed many-eyes advantage to Open Source bogus simply because having the people doesn't make them look. How many Firefox users look at the code? A tiny tiny amount. And yet even then bugs slip through. Sometimes big gaping security bugs. Because it's doubtful everyone looks at it all. Sure you may find a bug in one area you are focussed on, but does that cover how that part integrates with others and chains down? No. Heck I don't examine a lot of the subtext checkins; do you? (Ok, <strong>you</strong> might oh benevolent dictator, but you get my point).</p><p><br></p><p>Many eyes don't help unless the eyes are both focussed on the detail and wide enough to see the whole; and that's rare.</p>
