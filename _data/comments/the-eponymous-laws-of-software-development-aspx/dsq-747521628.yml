message: '<p>Briggs/Chase Law of Program Development: To determine how long it will take to write and debug a program, take your best estimate, multiply that by two, add one, and convert to the next higher units.<br>So for example if you estimate 6 weeks, then its<br>mult by 26wk * 2 = 12wk<br>add 112wk + 1wk = 13wk<br>shift unit:13 months.</p>'
