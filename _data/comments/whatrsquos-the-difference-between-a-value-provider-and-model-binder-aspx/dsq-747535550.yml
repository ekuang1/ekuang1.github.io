message: <p>Just a bit of feedback on the Json Value Provider introduction. I need to use a different JSON parser ( Newtonsoft is now using the new SerializationBinder.BindToName which offers pretty clean polymorphic JSON data models ) than the one provided by MS and after a few hours of digging it turned out that the built-in JsonValueProviderFactory is what was internally not providing the HTTP POSTed JSON data to the alternate ModelBinder (Request.InputStream was empty) that I created to use my own JSON parser.<br>Once I removed JsonValueProviderFactory from the ValueProviderFactories.Factories I was getting nice clean object bindings with my own DefaultModelBinder. I understand the seatbelt it is supposed to provide but in addition to the security issue that was also found (<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/imranbaloch/archive/2011/05/23/security-issue-in-asp-net-mvc3-jsonvalueproviderfactory.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://weblogs.asp.net/imranbaloch/archive/2011/05/23/security-issue-in-asp-net-mvc3-jsonvalueproviderfactory.aspx">weblogs.asp.net/...</a>) it may be worth an internal thread to discuss taking it out or making it in an opt-in.</p>
