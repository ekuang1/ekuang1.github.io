message: "<p>@Joshua you might be able to hack the normal empty project template to use the latest versions. But you'll need to do that periodically.<br>@Corey LOVE that idea! That might require building an add-in. My knowledge of the internal workings of VS isn't that advanced yet, but could be a fun side project in the future.<br>@Alex sorry to hear that. That first error probably indicates the file wasn't copied correctly to your project template location. Do you still have a bunch of zip files there? It's in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\Common7\\IDE\\ProjectTemplates\\CSharp\\Web\\1033 on my machine. Could you log an issue here: <a href=\"https://github.com/Haacked/ReallyEmptyMvc3ProjectTemplate/issues\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://github.com/Haacked/ReallyEmptyMvc3ProjectTemplate/issues\">github.com/.../issues</a> with more details. What kind of OS and VS are you running, etc.<br>@Battaile well that error is a 404 due to the favicon.ico. But the browser still loads a page with useful information. In my template, you get nothing.</p>"
