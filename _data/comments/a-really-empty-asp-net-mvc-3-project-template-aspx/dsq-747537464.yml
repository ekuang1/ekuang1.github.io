message: "<p>@ haacked<br>(a) thank you, much appreciated.<br>(b) a version for ASP.NET MVC 4 would be timely.<br>(c) i''m guessing that Steve Sanderson is either pulling your leg or attempting to trick you into ghost writing a chapter of his next ASP.NET MVC 4 tome.  regardless, imho, what would be useful would be injecting some comments to provide direction to persons new to ASP.NET MVC 3/4 ... if those comments are already present, please forgive me because this is the first time i've read *this* entry ... normally, i simply use the full template and alter/delete what i do not require.<br>@ Elearning<br>(d) try creating one project per ASP.NET MVC 3/4 project type and then spend as much time as you require in Solutions Explorer comparing the various generated project skeletions as well as the file internals, comparing differences and similarities ... compare also the references, et cetera ... imho, it's worth your time ... i've just started to do this myself ... there are many interesting things that you will notice.  Example:  ASP.NET MVC 4 adds \"BundleConfig.RegisterBundles(BundleTable.Bundles);\" to Application_Start() in the Basic template but not in the Empty template.<br>regards ~~ gerry</p>"
