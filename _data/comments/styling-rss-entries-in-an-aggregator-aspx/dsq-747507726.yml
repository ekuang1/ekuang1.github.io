message: <p>I'm actually not behind the idea of embedding a CSS stylesheet into the Rss Format.  The problem with that in my mind is that CSS is very geared to Html whereas the XML in RSS can be transformed into a presentation other than HTML (for example XAML).  <br><br><br><br>I think it would be better for a blog to "suggest" an XSLT style.  The XSLT could transform the Rss feed item into Html with Css, or anything else.</p>
