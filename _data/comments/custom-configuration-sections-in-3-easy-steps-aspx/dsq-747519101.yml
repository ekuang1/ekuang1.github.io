message: <p>I'm working on an ASP.NET MVC (beta) application where one of my controllers pulls a domain value from a custom configuration section.  This works fine when I run the application, but when I run a unit test to against the controller it throws an exception because ConfigurationManager.GetSection("foo") is null.  I also noticed that the appSettings collection is null, but the connectionString collection is initialized.  Might this be a bug or am I missing something with MSTest?</p>
