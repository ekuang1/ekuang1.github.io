message: '<p>This is a great step in the way Microsoft should develop frameworks. Thanks to every Microsoft employee who has been pushing for this from the inside. <br>The next step though: when will we be able to contribute, send patches, etc?<br>And when will codeplex switch to the more usable and open-source friendly subversion? :)</p>'
