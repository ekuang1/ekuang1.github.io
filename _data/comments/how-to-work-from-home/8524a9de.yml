message: Good article. I have been working from home for 11 years. I would add one tip. If your team is local and can actually come together without excessive travel, set a regular schedule to actually meet. I use this time to set priorities and provide direction to my team so that everyone fully understands what the goals we should meet by the next meeting. My team is a software team so we use this time to update the kanban which is the visual representation of our technical debt, work assignments, and our goals.
