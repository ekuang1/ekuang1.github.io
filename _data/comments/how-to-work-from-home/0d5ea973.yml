  Thank's for sharing, I second all of you points and have been working mainly from home for many years. The one thing I find hard is to separate on-line work time from on-line off-work hours. To the rest of the family it's "me at the computer" but it is very different when I work or when I do other stuff.







  That one has been the hardest for myself.
