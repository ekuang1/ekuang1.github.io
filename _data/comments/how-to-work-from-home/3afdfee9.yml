message: "This perhaps should come under the \"Overcommunicate\" section but when working from home you need to counter the perception that others will have that you're not actually working. \r\n\r\nEvery missed call or message from a colleague because you were in your kitchen making a coffee will increase people's perception. So message people periodically even if you don't strictly need to. \r\n\r\nThis applies especially if you're working different hours to your office-based colleagues. If they come in to work in the morning and see messages from you from last night, they'll not be so suspicious if they don't get an immediate response from you during *their* working day,"
