message: "Sup haacked! I've been working remote now for 15 years and I'll throw out a couple of things. 1) Invest in an amazing chair. You'll be sitting in it a lot over the years. 2) Get an amazing stand-up desk. Don't wait. Get it now, your body will thank you. 3) Make your home office your own and please, do some staging of your office so it isn't a distraction when you get on a video call. 4) Get out of your home office and go talk to people. Social interaction is important. For example, I try to make a point to go to lunch with a different friend several times a week. 5) Invest in your own whiteboard. 6) Don't be afraid to take your laptop, unplug it and *move* to different location if you are stuck on a problem. Changing your location can sometimes make the difference and get you out of a rut. 7) A nice wireless headset is a must. The one I have I can walk all the way to the mailbox and back on a call. Gives great flexibility when you need that extra cup of coffee. 8) Make sure you are always connected unless you are out of the office. If you run to town to do a quick errand and someones messages you or calls you, it should seem to them you are still at home. Don't miss a thing. All it takes is a few dropped calls and messages and trust will start to erode. I hope these help. Cheers. -@keithelder "
