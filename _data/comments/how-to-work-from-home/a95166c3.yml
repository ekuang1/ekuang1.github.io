  "For many this involves coffee and crying." marks the reality all too well. lol.



  I've been slowly transitioning into a WFH type of person, because of the new team being distributed all over the world, and what you said about Work Ritual actually resonates well with me. I believe having definite boundary markers of my Work Hours is something I really need, if I would like to continue like that.



  WFH is something I struggle, being a newly wed, me and the wife are still finding our balance of spaces in our one bed flat with two cats. I tell you, it's difficult to find a solid concentration that lasts even an hour. But we're getting there.



  Thanks Phil! - @hylegoz
