message: <p>Gambling with the fate of the entire human species?  WTF indeed!  As if it's all about us...<br>Science doesn't progress based merely on consensus.  Science progresses via facts gained from experimentation.  We simply cannot gather the facts here.  It's a plausible argument both ways--humans are, or humans are not, affecting this trend.  We can model, and form suppositions, but without a whole lot of identical planets, we just can't do the proper experiment.<br>Even if we're not affecting the planet's warming, there's little reason at all to not do better anyway.</p>
