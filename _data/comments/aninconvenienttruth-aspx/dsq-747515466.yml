message: "<p>Phil, I won't dispute whether Bon Jovi was there or not - if you say he was, that's good enough for me. ;)<br>What I have a problem with is the utter bastardization of science for a new religious crusade of which Al apparently is vying for the position of high-priest. (Repent! cast off your SUVs... or the world will end in fire!). <br>As for the science of global warming, Michael Chrichton gave an excellent lecture on the bastardization of science by politicians and those with an agenda. Read the entire lecture, it's brilliant, and warns of the perils of those who would seek to twist science to their own ends. <br>(WARNING: this page will 'shrink your browser down to a pathetically teeny-weeny size):<br><a href=\"http://www.crichton-official.com/speeches/speeches_quote04.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.crichton-official.com/speeches/speeches_quote04.html\">http://www.crichton-officia...</a><br>Likewise, plenty of climatologists dispute the whole 'humans are to blame' notion of global warming. (Remember, we're talking about a whopping .6 degree change in 50 years - and that's taking the numbers at face value (plenty of scientists have VIGOROUSLY challenged those numbers)).<br>Here's a great link/summary of some of those challenges:<br><a href=\"http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/harris061206.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/harris061206.htm\">http://www.canadafreepress....</a><br>As for the film... well... I appreciated this review:<br><a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/movies/66485.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.nypost.com/movies/66485.htm\">http://www.nypost.com/movie...</a><br>And if you think I'm a heretic for challenging global warming... here's a very 'progressive' view of why I should be able to argue:<br><a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/harsanyi/ci_3899807\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.denverpost.com/harsanyi/ci_3899807\">http://www.denverpost.com/h...</a><br>So yeah, while I respect you and your opinions, I do have to call BS on the whole global warming scare. I'm NOT advocating dumping crude oil into pristine lakes, I'm just suggesting that people start to THINK instead of listening to all of the CRAP that Bon Jovi, Bono, and Al are trying to foist off on to them.<br><br></p>"
