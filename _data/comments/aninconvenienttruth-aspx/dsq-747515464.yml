message: <p>1) The ozone hole.  Remember those photos of a big hole over the antarctic in the 80s?  The ones that made the cover of Discover magazine et al.  What did the previous year's photos look look like?  Or the previous 10 years?  We don't know.  Those photos were the first ones we have of that area--the satellite was launched earlier that year.  The working hypothesis was that there is a solid layer of ozone surrounding the earth, and when photos came back with a hole, then a new explanation was generated (humans F'd it up).  In the 20 years hence, we've seen the size of that hole wax and wane, nearly closing at one point.  Real science dictates that maybe the original hypothesis needs some revision.<br>2) What journals?  Peer reviewed journals, while the science is often good, the articles chosen for publication very often represnt the biases of the review boards.  This is a long standing and open critizism of the system.  The additional layer of review repsents another possible layer of bias (selecting journals which are in general favorable to the consensus which one wishes to be shown).  Finally, the interpretation of what constitutes "support" is very subjective.<br>3) There is little disagreement that the world is in a warming trend.  Are the causes man-made, or are these the forces of nature that have come and gone numerous times in the past?  10,000 years ago, this area (western PA) was covered in glacial ice a mile deep.  Those glaciers were long gone before my SUV hit the road.  The middle ages were marked by a mini ice-age to the extent that Swiss towns sent priests to exorcise the glaciers.<br>Concomitant with this warming trend is also an increase in solar activity, a slight slowing of the earth's rotation, and (I think, if I recall correctly) approaching perigee in the earth's orbit.  These could all cause warming, too.<br>4) The first Earth Day was held to warn the world of global cooling.  That's right--global cooling.  Proposals were put forth as to how to best melt the polar ice caps.  Why should anyone be skeptical when in less than 40 years the message has gone from "melt the ice caps to save the world" to "the ice caps are melting and the world's about to end"?<br>Are we at fault, or are we in the midst of a cycle which we have little (if any) effect upon?  QED.  But to conclude, in every day, in ways large and small, we can do a little better in everything we do.  Whether we'll save us and nature from itself is a different issue entirely.</p>
