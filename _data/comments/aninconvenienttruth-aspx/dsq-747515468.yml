message: <p>Where do you get these people?  C'mon people look at the CO2 levels.  You're gambling with the fate of the entire human species, or at least your precious standard of living (which I presume is high since you have the luxury of banging worthless crap off your little keyboards).<br>With the continuation of the human species at risk, you'd think we'd try to increase our margin for error.  Perhaps, attempt to minimize risk.  Nope, let's not do anything unless Google wraps it in a web page or convenient API.<br>Wake up people.  Check out a peer reviewed article.  Get off your ass and do something other than post worthless crap that inconveniences your souless way of life.</p>
