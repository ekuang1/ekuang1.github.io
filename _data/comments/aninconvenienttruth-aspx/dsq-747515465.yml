message: "<p>Regarding point #3.  It is clear that there have been warming and cooling cycles.  Looking at ice cores in Antartica that effectively preserve a climate record of over 100,000 years, the graph of the climate temperatures show this cyclical nature.  <br>However, what is startling is starting around the industrial age, the graph heads upward way beyond any of the peaks of the past 100,000 years.  It seems a strong coincidence.<br>Of course, on the other hand, we don't have the data for the past 100 million years to see if there is some meta-cycle.<br>The question is, even if there is a natural warming trend, are we exacerbating it by pushing it way beyond its natural peak?  Do we really believe that the amounts of CO2 we put in the air has absolutely no effect?  I think that's a hard one to swallow.</p>"
