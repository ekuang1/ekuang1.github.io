message: <p>I have previously been naming my test functions with [FUNCTIONNAME]_[TESTNAME].  But I've tried this method and I'm liking it so far.  It forces you to keep related tests together.<br>In the VS2010 Test Results view I found it useful to add a column for "Class Name" which when combined with the "Test Name" column gives you all the info.  Very nice.</p>
