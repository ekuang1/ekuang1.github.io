message: <p>I do something very similar, except instead of nested classes I create a namespace for the class under test and then create top level classes in that namespace for each method or scenario. I think this works a little nicer when using a test runner because it avoids the "ParentClass+Whatever" display, which I find noisy and hard to read.</p>
