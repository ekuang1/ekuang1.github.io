message: <p>Nice idea! I generally avoid terms like "method", "call" etc in my test names. You should name the feature and not the method of the class. When I do refactorings I often give other names to methods than I quckly added during the "make the tests green" cycle. But the feature I work towards remains the same.<br>Daniel</p>
