message: <p>This is an interesting way to organize the unit tests indeed.<br>Yet, I'm afraid I'll have to second the critics here ;-)<br>The problem I see with such approach is that it "perpetuates" the methods structure. Which is not good if you intend to continuously refactor your code (that inevitably results in methods extraction, collapsing, etc.).<br>Having a flat, single test class per single class under test structure makes it easier to keep the test suite in sync with the code. But I can see how laziness (among other factors ;-)) would prevent developers from reorganizing the UT classes in parallel with reorganizing the source code.<br>After all, a significant portion of refactoring is driven by code improvement rationale, not by adding new tests...<br>And notice that there's no automatic way to migrate and rename the corresponding tests when the business logic is moved to a different method.<br>So, my fear is that we'll end up (rather sooner than later) with the UT structure that is more confusing than helping, because it's out of sync with the real code structure.</p>
