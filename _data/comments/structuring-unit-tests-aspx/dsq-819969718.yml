message: <p>I've recently adopted this structure but for a reason that is more practical than mere organizaiton. Arranging unit tests in this way makes it easier to run all of the unit tests for a specific unit, without running any other tests. This prevents extraneous coverage due to non-relevant tests when white box testing.</p>
