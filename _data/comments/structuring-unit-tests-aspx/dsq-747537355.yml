message: <p>I've always wondered how other c# programmers would structure their unit tests. I sorta structure mines like yours, but I rather not use keywords such as 'method' for the test method names - I know by your programming skills that you won't do that in RL applications -, althought I think it fits very well in your example.<br>Thanks for the tips, really insightful!</p>
