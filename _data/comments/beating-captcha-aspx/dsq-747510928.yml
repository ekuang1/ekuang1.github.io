message: <p>I was thinking about that earlier and how absolutely irritating my CAPTCHA was to my authors. I've been thinking about creating a multifaceted approach to comment checking,<br><br><br><br>One example I was thinking of were pictures with questions asked about them. For example, a small image of 4 puppies. Different questions could be asked of the same image such as "How many ducks are in this image?" "What is the color of the collar of the 3rd puppy from the right" &amp; even things unrelated to the picture such as "Yellow and blue make what?".<br><br><br><br>Of course this approach makes posting even harder which might defeat the whole thing anyway.<br><br><br><br>My other solution would be to order something from a spammer, trace the money, find the bastards and kill them. I have an odd feeling even the most pacifistic of us would go for that idea.</p>
