message: <p>Could someone direct me to an easy program (or Firefox add-on)  that just bypasses Captcha altogether.  On some sites, it doesn't even show the image and/or form, and I can't register at all... :'(<br>It's bad enough when I have to make out what it says when it works (even with audio backup, I have trouble, as I'm hearing impaired as well as have incredible trouble making out what it wants me to type!)  :(<br>It's much worse when Captcha doesn't even appear on sites I really need to access!  :'(<br>I really hate Captcha, and the company behind it (BOO!)!  On top of that, they're making money off of their stupid, broken, and annoying products!  &gt;:(<br>Smarter/easier/free/privacy guaranteed spam catchers are the correct way of handling human recognition. :D<br>I'm not sure what Neural Networks are, but if it's just an automated human detection/spam bot blocker for web designers, I'm much more for that.  :)<br>(Great, when I submitted this form, it called it spam and is being moderated, hopefully my message will get through this too...) :(<br>(You may delete any extra duplicate posts that show up, if you want moderators - But I really need help, and would appreciate if my message could get through...)</p>
