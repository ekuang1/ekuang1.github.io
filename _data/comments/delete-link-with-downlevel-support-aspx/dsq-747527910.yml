message: <p>Very nice! I usually don't have to work about down-level browsers at work because we defined a white &amp; black list of browsers to support &amp; not support... also required JavaScript :)<br>Thanks for the pointers. Will definitely come in handy when I need to support those scenarios!<br>In either case, I do need to make sure my deletes and modifies are post only operations!<br><a href="http://twitter.com/elijahmanor" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://twitter.com/elijahmanor">http://twitter.com/elijahmanor</a><br><a href="http://zi.ma/webdev" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://zi.ma/webdev">http://zi.ma/webdev</a></p>
