message: "<p>@SelArom: No, you can't have the same method signature twice, regardless of the attributes. Normal C# rules still apply in MVC, there's no magic going on in the code as far as that's concerned.<br>I actually implemented what you suggested on my pet project this week, seeing how you mention it, I think I'll blog about it (might attract some people :P)</p>"
