message: <p>Funny, encouraged by one of your last blog posts, I've just started what is going to be my first MVP style <a href="http://ASP.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="ASP.net">ASP.net</a> Webapp and ran into exactly into the same problem .<br>I'm storing some temporary data in the session store and was wondering how I could deal with a dependecy on HttpContext when unittesting this piece of code.<br>Thanks for sharing, this looks like a good approach.</p>
