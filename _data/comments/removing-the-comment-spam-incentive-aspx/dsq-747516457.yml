message: <p>I installed this plug-in for Wordpress from a company called akismet and their url is <a href="http://akismet.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://akismet.com">http://akismet.com</a><br>It's been about 99% effective with removing spam from my blog. Since I added the plug-in, it's stopped over 2,000  messages.  I honestly can't think of a one that got throuh.   I'm not sure how hard it would be to implement their service into subtext but it could not hurt to take a look.<br><br></p>
