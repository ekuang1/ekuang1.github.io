message: <p>I'm ashamed to admit it, but I used to work for one of those companies that paid for the incoming clicks.  In my defense, I built the back-end for the site and wasn't aware of the marketing techniques.  Once I found out I immediately went looking for a new job.<br>When it comes down to it, most of these companies are run by people who don't realize that this is a problem, don't care, or both.  They care about their own bottom line because they are usually operating on razor-thin margins and are typically run by business flunkies, the kind of people who couldn't hack it at a real company and just ooze slime.<br>The worst are the ones who realize it's a problem and go to great lengths to keep doing business that way.  I worked for one of these.  There are actually a lot of ways to fight spammers.  Contacting their DNS provider with evidence along with a handful of other people will cause any reputable DNS provider to shut them down.  So our company went around finding less reputable DNS provider and spreading out our DNS servers.<br>For a long time I believed that the best way to combat this was for someone to write a virus that simulates clicks on a massive scale.  Kind of like a Denial of Service attack, but with the intent of costing these companies so much money they'd be put out of business.  Unfortunately, while working there, I learned that wouldn't work either.  The good spammers put web bugs into the links.  This bug is sent to the receiving company which then uses it in the url for an image after conversion.  You typically pay more for these kinds of links because they only charge for guaranteed conversions.  Combine that with the fact that we would verify every scrap of information we possibly could, the odds of a robot getting through and costing us money was virtually nil.<br>Ultimately I don't know what the answer is.  They will always find some sort of medium to spam.  No matter how many methods you shut down, there are always more.  User education isn't the answer either.  I can tell you, my mother will be clicking on those links until the day she dies.  I bet most mothers will.<br>&lt;/ramble&gt;</p>
