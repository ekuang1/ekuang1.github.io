message: "<p>It has always bothered me that recommended practise (in some circles) is to NOT store binaries in source control. As far as I'm concerned, a check in should contain everything required for either a deployment or a development environment. This allows a new developer to get up to speed quickly, and deployment to be as simple as a checkout/clone.<br>There are 3 possible solutions as I see it.<br>1. Write a post checkout script / deployment script / development script to fetch dependencies if they don't exist. Yuk.<br>2. Modify package management tools to auto-fetch for you; this would need to be combined with #1, as not all dependencies will be satisfied via a package management tool.<br>Or.. my favourite..<br>3. Make source control systems smarter! Don't keep differentials of binary files. What's wrong with a .hgbinaries file or similar for tagging the files you want to store un-versioned?<br>Mercurial has the 'BigFilesExtension' which makes a pretty good effort at #3. Fairly DRY, don't you think?<br>However, may as well be talking about stored procs vs direct table access. We're not all going to agree, so kudos on supporting both camps!</p>"
