message: <p>If you're trying to make an argument against ifs I suggest you don't create a condition in your rebuttal where you feel the need to write if. You used "if" in your argument in 3 times above. Why? Because sometimes using the word IF is more straightforward. Same rule applies for code I think. Let me know IF you agree :)</p>
