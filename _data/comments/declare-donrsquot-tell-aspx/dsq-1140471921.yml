message: <p>Lot's of cheese moved by saying death to the if statement. It does take a major mindset shift to go all declarative if you've been stuck in imperative for decades.</p><p>That being said it's only been since the Summit since I took a serious look at Rx and I must say I'm blown away, so I really appreciate your post -- especially a post that had been refactored into a better example!</p><p>PS It was nice meeting you last week :)</p>
