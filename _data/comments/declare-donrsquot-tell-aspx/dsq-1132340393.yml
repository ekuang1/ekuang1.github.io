message: <p>I would argue, aside from the snide remarks and (IMO) unfounded smugness of your point, that whether or not this is  simpler or more maintainable depends entirely on whether you grok the observable pattern and understand the RX API. Someone with experience with neither will find your example contrived and totally opaque. Perspective counts for a lot here, and you seem to disregard it as meaningless. Poor form and approach do nothing to convince readers who disagree with you.</p>
