message: <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I design my software for stability, usability, maintainability and extensibility first. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>I think those are great goals. How do you back that up? Can you quantify this? Or is it just an assertion you're making here? <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess my biggest problem with a lot of these new movements that come around, is that they sound great on paper, and work in an academic setting, then you put them in the hands of the grunts in the trenches like me, and they fall apart. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>Why do they fall apart?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;I would much rather mold my unit tests around my well designed software, than mold my software around a bunch of unit tests.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>Wouldn't we all :). You must be very good at what you do :). <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Other developers that get hired on don't care how my unit tests are structured, they care how the meat of my code is structured and designed.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>A bunch of well-written tests would show them all they needed to know.... <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;If I were to go to my boss and say "Well boss, our code design probably isn't optimal, but darn tootin' if it doesn't test well", I'd probably get fired.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>This is a silly statement (unless you really use "darn tootin" regularaly... which you might... just sayin...). Your code is your code, always. Your tests are your PROOF that you met the requirements as handed to you. So, to rephrase your statement "Well boss here's the requirements, here's the test coverage and results - can I have a raise?". <br>Here's the deail - I was, like you are now, a nay-sayer. I didn't see the benefit of writing code for code's sake, and thought that this was yet another way to charge the client for money.<br>And then I decided to hang up the presumption and try it (Green Lights and Ham should be the name of a TDD book). And wouldn't ya know... it SAVED me time after time.<br>I'm not going to try and convince anyone - but ask Phil, I used to give him a hard time constantly. And now I eat those words whenever I see him.<br>Just try it is all I'm suggesting.</p>
