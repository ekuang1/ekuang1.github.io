message: "<p>Yeah, the modal dialog stuff absolutely rocks...from what I can tell they are trying to move as much stuff to an \"in place\" editing type model to cut down the number of clicks it takes to do trivial stuff (that's the big push for 1.2...less clicks == less time to do stuff == less rountrips to the server).  Rob Howard has a short demo here:  <a href=\"http://communityserver.org/files/42/robs_files/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://communityserver.org/files/42/robs_files/default.aspx\">http://communityserver.org/files/42/robs_files/default.aspx</a><br><br><br><br>The killer feature for me is the integrated CMS system...at this point it's far from feature complete, but from what I've seen it's going to be pretty nice.  Ultimately I think it's time to give DNN some serious competition...I haven't used DNN in a while, but I remember it being very finicky and not so intuitive.<br><br><br><br>Keep on trucking with Subtext!</p>"
