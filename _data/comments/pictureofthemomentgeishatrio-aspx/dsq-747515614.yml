message: <p>Let me see if I can explain... the root word here is <b>Grig</b>. Using <a href="http://www.dictionary.net/grig" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.dictionary.net/grig">this</a> definition of the word Grig as a basis, combined with the context in which it was used... it is my assumption that there is some type of small insect creature with a bounty of snacks and some Duracells.<br>What I am still unclear in is exactly how this combination of items/beings is useful to a Geisha... unless she is on her way to visit one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku">Otaku</a> elite and these items are to serve as nourishment and power for his/her mix of portable gadgets!</p>
