message: <p>I'm glad you like it Phil... :) It was a total quick and dirty hack because I was just to lazy to hunt and peck through the Mix site.<br>As I wrote this utility (for the second time, the first doing the same for PDC08) I thought about how cool it would be if Microsoft were to provide a public supported "Conference API" (ConAPI?) Then let developers loose to provide UI's, mash-ups, alt access methods, etc. This would only enhance the materials for everyone, lowering the access bar (and make my life easier so I don't have to splunk the pages and guess at the API ;)<br>Anyway, thanks for the kind words and I'm glad the post was of some use (I did it just for me, the fact that others like it just adds icing to the cake :)<br>Thanks,<br>Greg</p>
