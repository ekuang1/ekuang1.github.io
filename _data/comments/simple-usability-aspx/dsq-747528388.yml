message: <p>Note that the site was updated yesterday or today. There was no direct link to <a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="sessions.visitmix.com">sessions.visitmix.com</a> or <a href="http://videos.visitmix.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="videos.visitmix.com">videos.visitmix.com</a> (which seem to be the same, btw) that I could find. Those pages now include links to previous year's conferences and the videos RSS feed now includes enclosures. The video RSS link is no longer directly on the page though, only in the page's head tags.</p>
