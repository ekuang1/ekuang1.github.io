message: <p>I couldn't agree more with this post.  I thought it was confusing/difficult to find the content that I was interested in.  I kept going to channel 9 to see if they had the content.  It took me 10 minutes to realize that when I searched for content on the sessions page that the results were showing up at the bottom of the page.  I kept expecting the "agenda" to change.  What I really wanted was to type in MVC to find all of the MVC content that Mix09 had to offer.  Finally Hanselman linked to <a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/Mix09" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://sessions.visitmix.com/Mix09">http://sessions.visitmix.com/Mix09</a> which was what I was looking for.  Then I spent the entire weekend refreshing the T44F page wondering where the video was.</p>
