message: <p>BTW, I found that there's another site <a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://sessions.visitmix.com/">http://sessions.visitmix.com/</a> which has very nice search functionality. If only the main site linked to that instead. <br>It even searches sessions from older Mix conferences!</p>
