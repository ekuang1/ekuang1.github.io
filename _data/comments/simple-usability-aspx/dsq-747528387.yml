message: <p>I was talking to a few people around MIX and even with Tom Lee before MIX about how terrible the site is.  I found it hard to navigate and the yellow text on colorful background at <a href="http://live.visitmix.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="live.visitmix.com">live.visitmix.com</a> is near impossible to see.<br>Would've been cool if they had a workshop or session that allowed people to re-design MIX10 site or something.  Hopefully they learn and make the TechED/PDC sites a little better.</p>
