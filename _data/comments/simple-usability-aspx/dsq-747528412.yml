message: <p>Amen!!!  A couple friends of mine started a company for creating web sites.  One is a web developer, the other is a web designer.  (I am a software (including web) developer.)  When we were talking, they asked me, "You at least know what the difference between a web developer and a web designer is, right?"  Hahaha, design is all about graphics, layout, animation, maybe a little rudimentary client script, etc.  The developer makes it do what it's supposed to do behind the scenes and may do some rudimentary layout stuff haha.  The user interface sorta sits between the two, so both need to know how to make a good one.  Since I'm not a designer, usability is usually my highest priority when I create a user interface.  But I feel you when it comes to designers haha.  Either they need someone else to oversee the interface or they need to learn more specifically about that themselves.  The first priority of a web site should be that it fulfills its intended purpose well--which directly involves usability.  Looking good in the process should be second.  (Typical developer view, right?  But designers seem to see it differently)</p>
