message: <p>I had the chance to participate in a small feedback group during a lunch at MIX09.  There was about 9 of us attendees there and they really wanted to know what we thought about the conferece, good and bad.  By far, while we all really enjoyed the conference itself, the most negative feedback they got was the site.  I'm glad that Microsoft and the MIX group are interested in hearing about all this.  It really was a great conference and I'm definitely hoping to come next year.  Thanks for the photo op Phil! :)</p>
