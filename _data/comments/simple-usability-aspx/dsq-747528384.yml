message: <p>The site also exposes another of my pet hates - filenames for download that give little indication of the content.<br>T20F.wmv might mean something if I have a schedule in front of me - but if I am on my mobile or trying to re-watch the session months later, would it be too much trouble to give me the name of the session in the file. Even abbreviated would be ok.</p>
