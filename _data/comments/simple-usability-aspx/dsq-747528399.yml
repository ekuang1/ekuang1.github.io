message: <p>Hi everyone, I am one of the folks who worked on the conference site. My day job is working on MIX Online (<a href="http://www.visitmix.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.visitmix.com">www.visitmix.com</a>), the community site related to MIX. The last thing I want to do is come in and say "But you don't understand..." or "We had constraints and legacy code...", blah, blah, blah.<br>I just want to say that we agree! We have had a lot of discussion here based on feedback as well as our own opinions and we plan to simplify the session browser next time around so that it will not only be easier to manage sessions before the event, but easily find and search (don't get me started on that...) for sessions as their recordings become available. We are also currently making some tweaks to make the sessions more discoverable located at <a href="http://videos.visitmix.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="videos.visitmix.com">videos.visitmix.com</a>.<br>I have forwarded the link to this post to other folks involved in the conference website as well. I appreciate that you all are taking the time to give your feedback in a constructive way. I really like some of the ideas that you all have come up with. A ConfAPI, now that would be awesome!<br><br></p>
