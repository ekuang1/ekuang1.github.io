message: '<p>How about for MIX10 instead of a 10k contest we have a design the session scheduler contest? The MIX team could expose all the data via a REST service and use OAuth to control the access. Then we could get a few choices on which interface we like best? <br>In my experience, all the session browsers in the past have been horrible: TechEd, PDC, MIX, etc.</p>'
