message: <p>I like this...wish I could be a fly on the wall when you guys are talking about how this would influence the invocation of scaffolders and vice-versa, or if there's a fit there at all.<br>Can recipe dialogs be invoked from context menus (like, in a code editor)?<br>Also, are the IRecipe interfaces (beyond folder) something that other project teams are already working on (WP, Azure, W8), or something you hope they pick up?  I like the idea of finding a more suitable place in the UI...recipes should be first class citizens in VS.  Even just the implications of adding mobile view support in an automated fashion to existing applications is significant.  So...even your trivial example is quite non-trivial.<br>Small rock, big ripple.<br>Btw...if you roast those peppers and toast the pine nuts, I think we have a very similar recipe. ;o)</p>
