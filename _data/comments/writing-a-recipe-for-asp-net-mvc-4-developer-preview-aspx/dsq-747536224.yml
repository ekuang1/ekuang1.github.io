message: <p>This seems a really great idea and I'm impressed it is available....<br>In the back of my head, I think back to all the previous tooling innovations like drag and drop data grids, designer generated classes - and I get a lot of bad memories.<br>I'm hoping people come up with some good uses for this tool and prove it is a worthwhile feature. <br>Until then, though.....<br></p>
