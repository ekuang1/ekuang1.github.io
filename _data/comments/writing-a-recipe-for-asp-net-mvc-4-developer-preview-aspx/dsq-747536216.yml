message: "<p>Very good stuff, as always. And even though I'm just an amateur in the ASP.NET MVC world, I find all of your post very informative.<br>For the 'Run Recipe...' menu option, I guess it would make sense, as you said, to put it as a top level option, and maybe have a \"recent recipes\" list ;)<br>One question: aside having to be run from a folder or file (for now, at least), are there any other constraints on what we can do with recipes?</p>"
