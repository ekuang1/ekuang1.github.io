message: <p>Phil,<br>  Couple of notes:<br>1. Reflection is restricted but not eliminated in medium trust.  The real restriction is that you can reflect non-public members of a type.  So as long as you limit your reflection to public members then relection is permissible.  This is why you can serialize objects with the XMLSerializer and not the Binary Serializer.  XML only serializes public members while binary serialization serializes all state including private variables, hence it will not work in medium trust.<br>2. FreeTextBox has been running for DotNetNuke in Medium Trust for almost 2 years.  I do not think we do anything special to make it work.  I will check further, but it is something that definitely is possible.<br>3. You may want to investigate the FCK Editor which, according to many users, provides a much better editor.  A provider was just put out for DotNetNuke for this editor and it is likely that this will become the default editor for DNN.<br>4. Lastly, we use multiple config files throughout DNN so I am not sure where the disconnect is here.  Maybe we can coordinate via email to track down this issue.</p>
