message: "<p>Joe, thanks for the feedback.  We actually do have an FCK Editor provider which I will talk about. I just haven't personally tested it so I couldn't be sure it works in Medium trust.<br>Regarding #4, do you access those config files via the new Configuration APIs?  How do you get around the need for ConfigurationPermission?</p>"
