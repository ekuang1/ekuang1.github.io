message: <p>yeah i agree, tell us who that vendor is.<br><br><br><br>As long as you stick to the facts, and it seems like you do, then you do no wrong, your actually helping them to get rid of the bugs.<br><br><br><br>Some companies do deliver bad components, I had my share of bad experiences with the larger companies not delivering what they should.<br><br><br><br>One example on the top of my head:<br><br>I needed a component to print the contents of TrueDBGrid (C1), so I went for the reporting tool also from Component One.<br><br>(The API was very simple compared to Crystal reports)<br><br><br><br>You could create a preview with it, what I found very usefull.<br><br>The only thing is that if you needed to print or preview more than 5 or 10 pages it took ages and took all cpu to render.<br><br><br><br>They also include pesky popup "Trial version" messages which already popup up twice at a customer of ours, while our development version worked just fine. I am probably to blame for these popups, but I NEVER have that problem with any of our other components from other vendors.<br><br><br><br>For the Horde :)</p>
