message: <p>I send emails to the user, user's department and IT department stating something about how "I boldy and defiantly leave my computer open, for the world to see." and some other funny things.  This then opens up a flurry of funny responses from the recipients, and usually by the time the offender returns to his desk he has a whole lot of email to wade through.</p>
