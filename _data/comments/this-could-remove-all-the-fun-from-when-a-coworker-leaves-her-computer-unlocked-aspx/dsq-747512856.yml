message: <p>I was tempted to get one of these when they first came out, but what good would it be when A.) Someone steals the USB transmitter, B.) The batteries in the "dongle" go dead, or C.) When you lose you keys?<br><br><br><br>Now that I think about it, if you had a laptop you could use it to locate your keys...just run around the house until it unlocks...hahaha. <br><br><br><br>I am much more tempted by the simple and convenient fingerprint scanning mouse/keyboard from MS, as much as I despise them. I was millimeters from buying it, then I found out it was all a scam to get people to use ghetto ass IE (it wouldn't work with any other browsers). Bleh.</p>
