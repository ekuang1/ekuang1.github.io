message: <p>Spot-on with my experience. I work for a small company (under 10 devs) and when I started 6 years ago, there was no written policy. Thankfully, this has changed, because I now take more time off, and I don't feel guilty for doing so. In all, having a set number of days has helped me avoid burn out.</p>
