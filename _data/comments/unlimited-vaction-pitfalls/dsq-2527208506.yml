message: <p>For sure, freedom suits some people, but not all. Sure we have people who can take extended  vacations on their own terms - but we employ them as contractors and pay them hourly rates. There is an agreement that that working model suits their lives better. But we have valuable people working for us, who in an environment without rules would do themselves and those around them a lot of harm. If you've ever worked closely with a highly-addictive personality you will know what I'm talking about. One year they will be working flatout until they are a hollow shell; the next year you will never see them in the office whilst they are out on long binges of drinking and gambling. A little of bit of structure and enforcement of expectations goes a long way to help these type of people (who are often brilliant, when they are under control).</p><p>I think companies in the early stages think that they simply won't hire people who don't fit their narrow cultural expectations, but inevitably the inability to hire diversely becomes an obstacle for growth.</p><p>Having rules and guidelines is vitally important to the human condition. Of course it is also important to know when to be flexible and allow rules to be broken.</p>
