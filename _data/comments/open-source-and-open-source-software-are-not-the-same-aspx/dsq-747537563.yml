message: <p>Do the people that complain ASP.NET MVC is not open source also say the same thing about Android? <br>Google does all the development in private and the code is "tossed over the wall" as you put it. And as far as I am aware they don't accept any community contributions. But they seem to call themselves an open source project. If that's the case, why can't the same apply to ASP.NET MVC?</p>
