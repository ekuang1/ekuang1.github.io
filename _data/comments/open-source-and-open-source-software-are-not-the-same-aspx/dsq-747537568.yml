message: <p>Hmm...  I'm grateful that the MVC has allowed users to look at its source code under a fairly permissive license; it has helped me solve a handful of problems in the past, and I think it's a real step forward for Microsoft.  <br>However, I think there is still a significant difference between what the MVC project has done and actual open source projects, and that using the term "open source" to cover MVC... could seem to some like a way of stealthily subverting the term "open source".  Shades of the bad old days of embrace/extend/exterminate, which not all of us have forgotten.</p>
