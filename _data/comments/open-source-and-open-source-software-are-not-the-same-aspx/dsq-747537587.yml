message: "<p>The semantics can be argued ad infinitum but in truth, these definitions suck. Using the normal rules of natural language, a fair and reasonable person would interpret \"open source\" to mean that they can get the source code. The phrase \"open source\" doesn't sound at all like a methodology, it needs a new name. Even Wikipedia has to have a disambiguation page, which (apparently incorrectly) states: \"Open source denotes that a product includes permission to use its source code [...]\".</p>"
