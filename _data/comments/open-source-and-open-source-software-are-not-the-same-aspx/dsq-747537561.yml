message: <p>Good write up Phil, I think something that a lot of people miss are some of the subtle nuances of when talking about "open source". I like to think of it as there are two distinctions, Open Source Software and Open Source Projects and an Open Source Project is the one people miss the subtleties with most often. The primary one I think most open source projects (or teams wanting to be an open source project) miss is community engagement.<br>All the public source code, issue trackers and OSD licenses in the world can mean nothing if as an open source project you develop disengaged from your community. I've seen (and been responsible for) projects that <em>surprise</em> their community with new features that were developed in private. As well received this often is being on the receiving end makes me sit up and wonder what else I'm not aware of from what I believed to be an open project. Is the work I'm doing now going to be redundant because the project is already doing it but I just don't know?<br>That's not to say that every time someone wants to be open source they need to call up all their users and check that they are ok with it, that's entirely impractical. ASP.Net MVC is a classic example of good open source <strong>software</strong> that doesn't need to be vetted as they aren't currently trying to be an open source <strong>project</strong>. But when wanting to be an open source project you need to work on finding a balance between involving the community in the decisions and directions of the project, which is not an easy task.</p>
