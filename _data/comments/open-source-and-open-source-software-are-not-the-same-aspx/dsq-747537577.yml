message: <p>I think all of this word-fudging is obscuring more than it clarifies.<br>I have found it easy to say "open-source licensed" (implying that the source code is available and the license fits the OSD).<br>Whether or not there is an open-source development project and how contributions to that process are accepted is a different and important matter.  <br>If contributions are not accepted, then the IP remains with the original developer.  If contributions require a copyright assignment, as Sun and Oracle did for <a href="http://OpenOffice.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> contributors, then the result is not fully open-sourced.  The downside is that alternative licenses can be made.  The upside is that it is possible to have clear IP provenance when contributing the project under a different license regime, as Oracle did when OO.o was contributed to Apache.<br>Apache, on the other hand, does not require copyright assignment but does require a contributor agreement that keeps the IP provenance clean for any substantial contribution.<br>Note that these aspects are fairly orthogonal to the license regime in many cases.  The FSF <a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html#Legal-Matters" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html#Legal-Matters">expects copyright assignment for contributions to GNU software</a>, for example.  LibreOffice is conducted without any contributor agreement beyond a simple declaration that the contribution is under the licenses that are being required by that project.<br>I would also say that a clear warning sign about an allegedy open-source project would be the lack of a publicly visible issue tracker and source-maintenance revision control.</p>
