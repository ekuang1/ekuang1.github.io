message: "<p>\"Open Source\", who says that it is a model of developing software?  As a software engineer, to me it may mean source code freely available to look at, learn from, and copy into my projects as needed.  I don't like plagiarism, and in my case, I will give credit to the author in the comments, but, others may directly copy it without giving thanks to the author.  Your definition places it down a narrow road.  \"Open Source\" may mean other things to other people.  I am sure that the term may have been used long before software was around.  Outside of software development, someone may say: open source what?  [What is open source(d)?  Like an old Abbott and Costello play on words.]</p>"
