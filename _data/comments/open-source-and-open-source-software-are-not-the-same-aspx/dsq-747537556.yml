message: <p>The definitions make sense to me, given the parity with Open Source Hardware.<br>In almost all cases I've seen, OSH is developed behind closed doors, maybe with some suggestions from outside. However, there generally isn't a great way to accept real community contributions (what would they be other than schematic or board layout suggestions?). It's more about what you're allowed to do with the hardware specs (or actual hardware).</p>
