message: <p>Open source is a license, and too many people still don't know what that means. Open source software is software released under that license.  <br>This has nothing to do with *how* the software was developed, what tools where used, or the policies of the organization on accepting code contributions.  It has everything to do with what you, as a user of that software, can do with it.<br>Don't muddy the pot even more by splintering the term to describe something that it's not meant to.</p>
