message: <p>"tossing it over the wall" is not a new concept. the bastion of open source software, GNU, developed emacs and GCC this way until 1999. If not for the success of linux and ESR's essay (CatB), they might still be doing it that way. in the case of android, i can see good reason for them tossing it over the wall, and i think they do accept patches but they are quite strict and the patches should be minimal. however, they seem to have had no interest in accepting anything from k9, and at this point the projects (k9 and ASOP email) are so different that taking something new from ASOP proves difficult.</p>
