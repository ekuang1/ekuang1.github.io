message: "<p>Yes, indeed, as Mike says I think the concept of Open Source revolves around the license. It's actually simple: Open Source, the source is in the open, do with it whatever you want (or almost everything, depending on the license). You can fork it, rebuild it, take it apart, put it back together, check where that nasty bug in your app came from, etc.<br>The objections people make are indeed just about the development process. While community development certainly has benefits I think in the case of MVC, which is so closely related to ASP.NET, Microsoft is choosing the right strategy by developing it and \"tossing it over the wall\" when it's finished. Let's be honest, MVC has proven to be a great product, and I thnk it would take quite a clever and big community to reach the same standards.</p>"
