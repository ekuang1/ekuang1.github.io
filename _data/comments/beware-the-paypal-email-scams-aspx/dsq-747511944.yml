message: <p>again I was nearly caught out by this. I recieved the old, send tracking number before your payment  can be credited. THey demanded to me that I use a fifty pounds tracking service as the phone was to be an easter gift for the buyers "fiance". The user was taken off ebay when I reported the original bid of over 4000 pounds...to secure the phone she said.....but still I recieved emails from "paypal" and "ebay" straight to my aol email account. This is what set bells ringing for me as I had already a genuine email from ebay telling me my fees had been refunded. THe buyers name was kate odimalju and she was supposedly on busines in nz. yeah right. But if it wasnt for the legit emails from ebay by hubby would have been willing to send this item.....so easy to get sucked in with an official lookin email. :)</p>
