message: <p>My situation is similar to the one above.  I received an email from paypal, so to speak, and it said that I needed to send the tracking number for verification of the phone i had sold on ebay.  I just feel stupid because it took me 3 weeks to finally figure out that this was a clever fraud to get my phone for free.  Don't let that shit happen to you.</p>
