message: <p>That was pretty close, I have been receiving mails from them for quite a while. I was wondering why they where so persistent and kept bothering me about someone trying to get into my account. Instead of clicking the link they provide, I went to paypal site and log in. There were no notices. <br>I recieved more emails from them, so I clicked the link, and saw them asking for a SSN#. i am not dumb, who would want to give out their ssn# to some sites you knew never asked for one.</p>
