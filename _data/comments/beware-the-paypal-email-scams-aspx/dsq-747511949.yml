message: <p>I am longer in possesion of the email I reviced as I have deleted them all but I too was targeted by this scam. Luckily by nature I am a very cautious person. <br>The base of the email was something like those above. Saying that I would recive funds once tracking number was given. Then I recived another e-mail saying it needs to be sent to Nigeria for a business client.<br>Furthermore when clicking on thier ebay profile I discovered they had been banned from ebay and when I clicked on their feedback option it read 'Cannot view this page due to difficulties'<br>I then recived an email that read 'We are pleased to announce 'X - username' account has been reinstated and you should commence any trade you are doing with them. When I saw the email address 'e_bays@usa.com' I 100% new it was fruad. <br>These are ways I have been able to spot fraud. The  most basic one is <br>-spelling and grammar. In this email there was a numerous amout on spelling mistakes and capital letters in the middle of sentences. <br>-Urgency. You would nver be asked by ebay or paypal to send or do anything withing 24/48/72 hours.<br>-A Sob Story. Dont believe any story given especiallly about sending goods to africa<br>for security i also changed my paypal and ebay passwords immediately after<br></p>
