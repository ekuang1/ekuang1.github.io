message: <p>Yep, i just got scammed as well. I didn't think anything of it when they offered me way more than what the product was worth. I made them call me. Guess how they called me? Through a sprint operator for someone who is hard of hearing and the messages were relyed from this guy over the phone. This is smart and also makes the scam even more believable. There is now no phone records of this. They wanted me to ship it to their kid in Nigeria. I wasn't even thinking. I had an ipod docking station listed for $60, and they offered me 200 for it. I accepted it and then the paypal thing came into play, with emails from paypal, payment pending, blah, blahm blah. I totally beleived it. I figured out this was a scam a day after i shipped the item and there was no money in my account. I tried to re-route the package but once it leaves the country that's impossible. <br>So for everyone out there on ebay and craigslist, beware of these people and always call paypal directlly if you beleive an email is fake because they can tell you if they sent you anything or if there is any activity in your account.<br>This item was being shipped to Nigeria and i was contacted by:<br>Jenifer Justin<br>goodade2006@gmail.com<br>BEWRAE BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
