message: <p>I am so glad that I found this website. I was literally in the middle of being scammed! Had a bit of a gut feeling someting was dodgy so decided to google shipment tracking number and this website came up, i couldn't believe I had caught the little a**holes trying to scam me out out of £400! This con artist bid on my item on ebay in the last minute. They totally ignored the fact I had said I would only post to the U.K and asked me to send it to NIGERIA! This rung alarm bells straight away. He/she then proceeded to tell me she was sending the xbox to a student of hers for a bday present who was on a work placement in Africa! also they could'nt decide what sex the student was, one minute referring to the student as a he then the next a she. Serious alarm bells started ringing after that!<br>I then recieved an e-mail from 'paypal' telling me a payment has been made into my account hmdhvball1@aol.com, it then said the money would not be credited into my account until I provide paypal with postage proof i.e shipment tracking number for verification and asked me to e-mail the number to shippingprove@usa.com. This person tried every trick in the book, they even asked me to fork out £120 of my own money so that I could send the package in the morning so it would get there for a birthday surprise. Another thing was that any e-mails that were sent from this person went straight to my yahoo e-mail account and not through ebay which I thought was funny as usually a copy goes to both. Do not trust the user id hdmvball on ebay and whatever you do do not send anything to nigeria before checking its legit! Hopefully this will help other people from falling for this bullshit scam!</p>
