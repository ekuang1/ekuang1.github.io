message: <p>Well I've been scammed. My email came right after I added a second bank account to my paypal (as in 1 day later), explaining that my account had been edited and that I needed to verify the information. without a second thought I added all my information, seeing as I HAD just edited my information. Now I cannot log in, I cant access my history, and customer service (since I'm assuming its out sourced) cant even understand my plain English!<br>I really dont know what I'm to do now, besides change my bank account information again (I had a similar thing happen with amazon a year or so ago). But what about the money in my paypal account? where will that go???<br><br></p>
