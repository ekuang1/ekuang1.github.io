message: "<p>I too received a paypal email response from someone who wanted to receive some merchandise from me by paying through paypal but after doing some much needed research on the internet I came accross your website. After stating clearly that I preferred to do business in person via Craigslist with the buyer, I was told by the buyer that they would even pay more for the merchandise. I agreed at first but started to have my doubts. Here is an example of the scam after I received the below email (receipt number 3514-0043-2038-8866) stating that the funds had been credited into my account, with stipulations of course. I smelled a rat. Mind you, the response was on what would easily be considered official paypal letterhead. Sellers please beware!<br><br>Receipt Number: 3514-0043-2038-8866 <br> <br>Keep your Receipt Number (shown above) for future reference. You will need to refer to this number if you need customer service from P.A, Inc. or from PayPal.<br><br>This PayPal® payment has been deducted from the buyer's account and has been \"APPROVED\"but will not be credited to your account until the shipment reference/tracking number is sent to us for shipment verification and this is done to secure both the buyer and the seller against any fraudulent activities. Below are the necessary information requested before your account will be credited. Send tracking number to us or email us through this mail online.paytransfercentre@accountant.com and our customer service care will attend to you. As soon as you send us the shipment's tracking number  the money will be credited to your account and this is done for security purposes and the safety of the buyer and the seller.<br>This payment is approved but it will stand as payment pending until we receive the shipment reference/tracking number from you.<br> <br>                    **PLEASE NOTE**<br>Once shipment has been verified and the tracking number sent to us, <br>You will receive a \"CONFIRMATION Email\" from PayPal® informing you that the Money has been credited<br><br>Thank you for using PayPal!<br>The PayPal Team.<br></p>"
