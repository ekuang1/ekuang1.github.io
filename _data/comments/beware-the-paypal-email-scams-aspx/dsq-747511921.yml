message: <p>I just opened a Paypal email. I have never used paypal before and haven't the slightest on how to but this email, for somereason said some is using MY account, which i don't have to use money. I was about to use the Link to the site, but realising it was a link to <a href="http://www.idenwar.com/xboxmod/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.idenwar.com/xboxmod/">www.idenwar.com/xboxmod/</a>....... I immediatly stopped. <br><br>      Nearly being fooled from this genuine looking email i have learnt never to trust stuff like that again!<br><br></p>
