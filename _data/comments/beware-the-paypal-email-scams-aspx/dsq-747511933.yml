message: <p>Yea, i got the same email saying to send the transaction number for the paypal payment to be confirmed. I never did paypal before so i supposed thats how it worked, check on the internet and saw this site, found out it was fake, tried stopping the package right as it was getting picked up. Guy from kinkos said they couldn't stop it while they were scaning the boxes, now i have to pay an extra 350 to get it back on top of the 350 i already paid shp/h. <br>&gt; This PayPalÂ® payment has been deducted from the buyer's account and <br>&gt; has been "APPROVED"but will not be credited to your account until <br>&gt; the shipment reference/tracking number is sent to us for shipment <br>&gt; verification and this is done to secure both the buyer and the <br>&gt; seller against any fraudulent activities. Below are the necessary <br>&gt; information requested before your account will be credited. Send <br>&gt; tracking number to us or email us through this mail <br>&gt; online.paytransfercentre@accountant.com and our customer service <br>&gt; care will attend to you. As soon as you send us the shipment's <br>&gt; tracking number the money will be credited to your account and this <br>&gt; is done for security purposes and the safety of the buyer and the <br>&gt; seller.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This payment is approved but it will stand as payment pending until <br>&gt; we receive the shipment reference/tracking number from you.<br>p.s.<br>Guy was on craigslist too, don't trust people from ireland. this guy went by john jamesimi... googled it and got this guy off myspace <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=12098088" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=12098088">http://profile.myspace.com/...</a> could be him but not sure. oh yea and send all the hatemail you can to 4b belgree house dublin 15, dublin ireland.</p>
