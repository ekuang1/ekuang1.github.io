message: <p>Beware of the any buyers on ebay offering you to buy the item via email (eg 000_roland@fastermail.com) and then sending you payment emails claiming to be paypal (paylink@consultant.com) saying “payment has been deducted from the buyer's account and has been "APPROVED"but will not be credited to your account until the shipment reference/tracking number is sent to us for shipment verification so as to secure both the buyer and the seller” which is crap. I fell for the scam when I was selling a mobile phone on ebay and half way through the transaction when I realised it was a scam I had fallen for after having sent the item.<br>I lost the phone without any payment of the phone and send the item to him which cost me £12 out of my own pocket. As I realised after sending the item I thought I could redirect the item back to England however royal mail would not allow that to happen as they said they have no control over the parcel after it left England.<br>He gives a long sob story how he is a doctor called “Dr Roland Jones based in the UK and needs immediate purchase of the phone needs it for one of his church sector in Africa. I will like to know the condition of the item, does it has its box and the accessories. I will offer you GBP --- plus GBP 20 for postage Via royal mail service, to West Africa because it is needed urgently. I would have loved to receive the shipment here and later send it but due to my kind of job, I travel a lot and that is why I need you to send straight to him. I will be making payment through (Paypal) <br>and so i will want to complete the transaction in a timely manner and ship out immediately after you are been notified of the payment Approval.”<br>Paypal nor ebay can do anything regarding this and nor was I expecting to do anything as they are crap like that. I also know a friend of a friend who has fallen for this scam who was also selling a mobile phone on ebay as well.<br>I wanted to others aware of this scam and to prevent others falling for the same scam as this is still going on and hopefully you should have better luck then I did in being able to identify a scam when you see on.</p>
