message: <p>Nigerian fraud alert!! My daughter received the same message after a buyer purchased an expensive item from her on ebay. It was her first ebay sale (and new to PAYPAL as well), so she shipped the package out to Nigeria, since PAYPAL verified the transfer of funds.... WELL, that paypal email was a FAKE, the money never appeared in her account and she received horrible taunting emails from these crooks telling her there is nothing she can do about it, the merchandise was GONE.  All in all, she is definitely out of $$$$.  Ebay and Paypal can't do anything.... There has got to be some type of action that can be taken against these CROOKS!!  Anyone out there had a positive outcome from reporting the same type of fraud to Paypal?</p>
