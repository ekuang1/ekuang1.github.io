message: <p>looks like those nigerian mother fuckers are hitting the smaller sites too now.  I was trying to sell my gf's cell phone and i got one from boa (bank of america) and paypal saying that i would get my payment as soon as i send them a tracking number but thats another version of an escrow account scam.  Paypal can suck in many ways.  Luckly i have never got into any of that.  If i am the seller i have the right to refuse the buyers offer if i don't like him cuz IT is from nigeria.  I have never been ripped off and personally i kind of feel you deserve to if you don't know better.  But i don't want to be mean it's just americans should be smarter and not trust other countries.  we have enough problems here.</p>
