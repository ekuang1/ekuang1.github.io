message: <p>HAHA!  I loved that game too.  My brother and I would play that game for hours on our Commodore 128.  That's too funny that we both had a C128.  I also owned an Amiga.  <br><br><br><br>When I was in college we had a group of Amiga users that all hung out with each other.  Yes we were nerds but us Commodore dudes stuck together.  Then one day everything stopped for the Amiga and I realized I better learn a new OS besides the Amiga.  The dream that everyone was going to use the Amiga was over!  There used to be this Amiga store right by the college and we would go down there once a month and hang out and dream of owning the Amiga 5000!<br><br><br><br>I found that program that emulated the Commodore 64 a few years ago.  Man did that bring back the memories.  Remember when you had to type RUN and then the program name!!<br><br><br><br></p>
