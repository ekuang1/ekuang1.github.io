message: "<p>Your \"CodeCastExpression(....\" syntax to for calling GetEvalData doesn't seem to work with User Controls in ASP.NET. I have a UserControl that has a Label which is bound to a property in the code behind (let's call this property \"Text\"). This property is being assigned as follows:</p><p>Text=\"&lt;%$SharedResources:MyString%&gt;\"</p><p>Where \"SharedResources\" is the name of my custom expression builder as defined in the web.config of the project.</p><p>Upon running, the expression builder is throwing a null exception in the return statement of</p><p>GetCodeExpression. Why this is happening, I have no idea, but it seems to be quirk of whatever .Net is doing to process the expression builder.</p><p>It seems leaving out the CodeCaseExpression part as is done here:  <a href=\"http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/022509-1.aspx#postadlink\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/022509-1.aspx#postadlink\">http://aspnet.4guysfromroll...</a></p><p>...eliminates the null exception problem.</p>"
