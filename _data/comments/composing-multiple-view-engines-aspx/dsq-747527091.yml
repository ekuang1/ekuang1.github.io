message: <p>@Mike Not sure how this helps in migrating from WebForms to MVC. The view engine I referred to is the <code>WebFormViewEngine</code> which is part of ASP.NET MVC.<br>This view engine makes use of WebForms only to render views. You still don't get PostBack or ViewState etc... with this view engine. At least not in any supported fashion. :)</p>
