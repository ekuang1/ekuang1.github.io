message: <p>Haack, very cool. Maybe some simple standards will emerge for modular MVC site architecture.

It's been compared to other template engines too, like Genshi (<a href="http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/xml-templates.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/xml-templates.html">genshi.edgewall.org/.../xml-templates.html</a>) and Kid (<a href="http://kid-templating.org/language.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://kid-templating.org/language.html">http://kid-templating.org/language.html</a>)... Is that a bad thing? Most html template engines end up solving the same problems, so similarities are kind of unavoidable.<br></p>
