message: <p>Spark looks like the solution to all my spaghetti looking views.<br>I did see and try Spark before, but I refused to use it for a real project because having a ".spark" iconless extension is just too strange. Is there a way to make VS2008 support .spark just as good as it supports .aspx? (with all the intellisense and everything).</p>
