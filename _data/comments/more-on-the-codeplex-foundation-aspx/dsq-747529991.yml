message: <p>Ayende,<br>If a contributor to an open source project keeps ownership of the copyright of their contribution, then permission will have to be granted by the contributor.<br>If an open source project's license allows for copyright of all contributions to remain the property of the contributor, then the project itself would be at great risk.  Copyright owners could  force the project to remove their contributions at will.<br>That said, an open source project community should feel good about transferring the ownership of project's copyright to an intermediary like The Apache Foundation, The Eclipse Foundation, The CodePlex Foundation, among others.</p>
