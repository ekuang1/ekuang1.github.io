message: <p>As a .NET developer whose been getting more involved with OSS, this is good news.<br>For the most part, there aren't any open source .NET projects that even approach the size of either Eclipse or Apache. This makes it very difficult for a foundation that supports .NET developers to form based around a specific project or piece of software. Somebody needs to take the leap to form the foundation and others need to take a chance to trust that foundation. As far as I can tell, the guys at the Codeplex Foundation are putting themselves on the line by getting this ball rolling than I am as a developer helping them.</p>
