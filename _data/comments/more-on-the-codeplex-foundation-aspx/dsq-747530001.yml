message: <p>@Joe<br>I'm not really talking issue of trust.  The trust or ideology topics aren't all that interesting to me, but instead more the mechanics of things.  I'm more than willing to take MS and CodePlex Foundation at face value.  Actions are more important than speculating motives.<br>Also, I'm not sure how DNN Foundation is like CodePlex.  You created DNN Foundation for an existing successful project, yah?  CodePlex is a Foundation without a cause right now.<br>If you mean DNN is like CodePlex because you both require copyright assignment, I wasn't arguing that point.  In fact FSF, Apache, etc are similar in that regard (as I understand).  I don't have a problem with copyright assignment.<br>It's more about copyright assignment to something that already has a lot of momentum.  Someone has to get this thing going.<br>@Phil<br>I would like to know more about how copyright assignment protects contributors.  Basically, protected from what?  It can't and shouldn't legally protected me, a contributor, from copyright infringment, can it?  I mean, that seems silly that contributing copyrighted code to CodePlex would indemnify me and put the burden on the Foundation.  Also, I obviously can't assign CodePlex copyright for code I don't own the copyright too in the first place.<br>A lot of foundations talk about this part, but I'm kind of confused.</p>
