message: "<p>@Scott Koon:<br>Oh I totally agree. This is the jungle and I'm starting to feel like the prey...<br>On the topic: I believe the CPF has already succeeded in one very important thing: It made us all think about these issues and how they are not handled at the moment. <br>Especially with the general shift towards NHibernate and Castle we are seeing lately, I believe it's important for these Projects to find out how to cater to the enterprise. <br>Ayende's Business Support for NHibernate is a step into the right direction, but also getting these legal things out of the way is one major point in broad adoption of \"best of breed\" technology. And may the CPF fail, at least the general community had to think about that stuff.<br>greetings Daniel</p>"
