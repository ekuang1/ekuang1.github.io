message: <p>Also, Eclipse Foundation, Apache Foundation, you see a pattern with those two?  You had an product deployed and developed by several vendors with a proven track record before a foundation was born.  It wasn't like the Apache Foundation was founded and then the guy who wrote httpd was like 'hey lets give it to this cool foundation'.<br>CodePlex is much more field of dreams style.  I'm not sure if there is an equivalent to that?</p>
