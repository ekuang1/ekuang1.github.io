message: <p>Oh, and I forgot(Sorry for double-posting)<br>Will Microsoft maybe put the ASP.NET MVC Project onto the CPF?<br>I mean it would make total sense to me. It's MSPL, and even if they don't accept outside contributions, they are still a OSS project that could be used as an example of how the CPF works.</p>
