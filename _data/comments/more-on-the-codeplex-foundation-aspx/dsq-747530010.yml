message: <p>This is a very interesting concept.  I am not sure about all of the information here. If you assign the copyright I don't know how you would be able to get it back as an assignment is transfering your ownership.  If you license I can see termination.  As far as protecting against infrigement by assignment one would have to examine the particulars of the assignment and in fact there would be at least one infringement. There also could be contributory infringment issues.</p>
