message: <p>@Eyston - Actually, DotNetNuke has operated like the CodePlex Foundation since around 2004/2005 when we started accepting project contributions.  Since our inception we have required copyright assignment for all contributions.  <br>Quite honestly, there will be some people who are hesitant to contribute in the beginning, but over time I expect that people will come to see that with people like Phil, Rob, Scott, Shaun, Miguel and others involved from the beginning that it is not just a bunch of stuffed shirt lawyer types involved. <br>The founding group of advisors and board members are people who are passionate about Open Source and who have long track records of work in the Open Source space.  Even if you did not trust Microsoft, I think you can trust the group of Advisors and Board members as many of them have been strong advocates for Open Source over the past several years.  They are not a group of individuals who would stand around and allow Microsoft to do anything to undermine OSS principles.</p>
