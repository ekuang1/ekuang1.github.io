message: <p>"For the rest, I confess to you that, although I myself often take a certain personal delight in the mere subtleties of speculation, although I also enjoy at times the miserliness which makes the professional student hoard up the jewels of reflection for the sake of gloating over their mere hardness and glitter, I find always that when I come to think of the thing fairly, there is, after all, no beauty in a metaphysical system, which does not spring from its value as a record of a spiritual experience."<br><br><br><br>-- The Spirit of Modern Philosophy, by Josiah Royce<br><br><br><br>I just transcribe them, I don't explain them.</p>
