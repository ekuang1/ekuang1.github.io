message: <p>It actually shocks me how many software engineers have never heard of Steve McConnell or, less forgivably, read _Code Complete_ (it's understandable I guess if you've read it but don't recall his name).<br>I think so many people code as a job and don't feel the need or desire to read books about being a better engineer that aren't "How to do Ajax"-style books.<br>Love your blog, btw.</p>
