message: <p>In a hope I don't get my ass set on fire here from all abuse that might head my way.<br>In the last 15 years of my life I think I have read maybe 2 full books, both of those are in the last year and neither were by Steve McConnell.<br>Reading hasn't been something I have enjoyed and while I have struggled by, picking chapters out here and there, it is something I want/need to put right.<br>This is where I was hoping some of you would be willing to help me out and let me know what you think I really must read, (big text and lots of pictures preferred).<br>You can email me at simon(at)maquiladora(dot)co(dot)uk</p>
