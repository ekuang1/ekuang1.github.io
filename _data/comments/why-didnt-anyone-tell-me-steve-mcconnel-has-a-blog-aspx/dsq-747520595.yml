message: <p>Remmus,<br>Don't worry about any flames you may get..they die down when the trolls find a new target :)<br>I understand where you're coming from, and I think there are many others who share your frustration. <br>Reading a technical book is very different from reading a novel or other nonfiction book.  Even the best tech books should not always be read cover to cover.  There's different techniques...maybe it's time some of the top bloggers out there give us their strategies for reading new tech books?</p>
