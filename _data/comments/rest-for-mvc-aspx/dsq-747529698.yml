message: <p>SDK team, is there an intent to bake some of this into ASP.NET MVC 2.0 _assuming_ the community approves of it? If so, is there time left?<br>As much as I love all this MVC stuff, I'm starting to get a bit 'Beta-Tired' at the moment *blush*. I really jumped onto the ASP.NET MVC bandwagon early (because i've been DYING for this to come to the ASP.NET world) ... but as we all know with BETA's, etc... expect things to change :) I'm all well and good with that .. but just a bit tired after doing that for a year .. so i'm having a break until 2.0 is released (instead of me changing, changing, changing, etc :) ). <br>Which is why i'm _hoping_ this will be baked in really early, if we're all pretty kewl with it...</p>
