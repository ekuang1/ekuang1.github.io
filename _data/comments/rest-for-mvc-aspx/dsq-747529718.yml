message: "<p>@PK: yes it is possible. If you look at the controllers in any of the examples you will notice that the model is based on HttpException: in any action you can do throw one of those, EG:<br> throw new HttpException((int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError, \"There was an error processing your request\");<br>the exception will be handled by the SDK code and rendered in the appropriate format on the wire. What's in the SDK currently by default will just serialize a string on the wire, resulting from HttpException.ToString(), but you can override this, by setting HttpException.Data[\"details\"] to any object of your choice, and we will serialize that instead (this code is in ResourceErrorActionResult.cs BTW).</p>"
