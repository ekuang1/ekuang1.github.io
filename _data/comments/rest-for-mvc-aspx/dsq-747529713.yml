message: <p>I used the ASP.NET MVC REST SDK for building atom feedS for our exception logging dashboard and it worked perfect. <br>When creating the syndication content, I used CreateHTMLContent and added a tag around my HTML content string. Now it shows in a nice formatted way on internet explorer. But when reading the feed through outlook 2007, I am losing the formatting. Do you have any idea how to format the feeds for outlook 2007.<br>Thanks,</p>
