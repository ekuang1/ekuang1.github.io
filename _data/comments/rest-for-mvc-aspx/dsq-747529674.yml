message: <p>There is a discussion going on a Chinese blog:<br><a href="http://www.cnblogs.com/JeffreyZhao/archive/2009/08/18/awful-design-in-asp-net-routing.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cnblogs.com/JeffreyZhao/archive/2009/08/18/awful-design-in-asp-net-routing.html">www.cnblogs.com/.../...ign-in-asp-net-routing.html</a><br>related to the RouteBase class. The author was wondering why MVC team didn't follow the Framework Design Guildlines'<br>interface-&gt;default base class implementation<br>approach?<br>Or because your team has some extension idea in mind?<br>Thanks.</p>
