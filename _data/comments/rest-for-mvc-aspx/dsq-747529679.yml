message: <p>I was never quite convinced by the WCF version of REST. It seemed very heavy weight and did not have the flexibility that I could get using ASP.Net MVC. I've written a whole series on getting what I believe is a truely RESTful service working with ASP.Net MVC. It also supports multiple representations, including HELP. However it provides a true MVC approach to serving XML where the views are XSLT files.<br>What I would like to see in the next version of MVC, rather than WCF being brought in, is support for overloading POST as I described in this <a href="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/post/2008/11/09/Creating-a-RESTful-Web-Service-Using-ASPNet-MVC-Part-9-e28093-Overloading-POST.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/post/2008/11/09/Creating-a-RESTful-Web-Service-Using-ASPNet-MVC-Part-9-e28093-Overloading-POST.aspx">article</a>, built in support for XSLT views as I created <a href="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/post/2008/10/02/Creating-a-RESTful-Web-Service-Using-ASPNet-MVC-Part-3-e28093-Multiple-Representations.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/post/2008/10/02/Creating-a-RESTful-Web-Service-Using-ASPNet-MVC-Part-3-e28093-Multiple-Representations.aspx">here</a> and more control over the errors returned to the client.<br>I'd love to know what you think of the series:<br><a href="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/category/ASPNet-MVC.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/category/ASPNet-MVC.aspx">http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/category/ASPNet-MVC.aspx</a><br>Having said that... I'll give this SDK a try. Thank you for pointing it out!<br>Piers</p>
