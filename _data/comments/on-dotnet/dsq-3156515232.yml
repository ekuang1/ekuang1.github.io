message: <p>The U.S. system of government relies on checks and balances, where each branch of the government serves to stop overreach by the others. The executive branch is meant to lead, but the will of the people is supposed to continually be enforced by the legislative branch. The judicial branch serves to make sure that the will of the people does not overrun the fundamental rights of all citizens. We live in a republic, not a dictatorship. The people are supposed to have a continuing and meaningful voice in government, not just a vote every couple of years.</p><p>So when you say to "let him do his job," I don't see anyone stopping him from doing just that. What I see are people asking their representatives in government to enforce their wishes in the governing of the realm. Now, unfortunately, we have seen a consolidation of power in the executive branch for generations, as congress has abdicated their responsibilities to the people in order to increase the power of their parties. At this point we have congressmen that exist completely in service to their party, unwilling and, truly, unable to enforce the will of the electorate where it deviates from their party goals.</p>
