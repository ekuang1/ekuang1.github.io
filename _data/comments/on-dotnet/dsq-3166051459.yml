message: <p>Again someone fail at understanding democracy. Democracy is simply majority rule. He did not win a majority of votes behind him and thus did not win a democratic election. Stop using that argument when it is not actually valid. This is the second time in recent history that the American election process has failed to produce a democratically elected leader.<br>You SHOULD be fighting this!</p>
