message: <p>No, it is not. In a democracy the majority rules. Your president did not win the majority. He won the vote in a system not quite unlike a democracy, yet really not a democracy, so your argument fall kinda flat. I am glad to see there are many US citizens ready to fight off what is happening right now.</p>
