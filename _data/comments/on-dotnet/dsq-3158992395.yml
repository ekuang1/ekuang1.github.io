message: <p>Please re-read what I said. Democracy worked just fine in the election. In addition to that, it is a system that requires engaged citizens beyond voting. Just because one side won, does not mean the others shut up and sit down.</p><p>The same happened 8 years ago and the tea party movement was born. They did a great job of being vocal and using their activism to effect change by electing people who represented them and limited the President's power. They marched, went to town halls, called their representatives, and voted.</p>
