message: "<p>\"When Microsoft ships an interface, it has to expect that there will be many many customers out there [...].\"<br>A case in point: Under XP I have made my scrollbars about 1.5cm wide. I did that through the Accessibility Wizard.  I can't do it in Vista. The \"Easy Access\" centre doesn't provide that.  It's apparently hidden somewhere, but no books on vista that I have seen tell me where it is, and the available help (it's not connected to the net) has nothing.  It took me long enough to find the \"Easy Access\" centre, given that the term used by disabled people for this sort of thing is \"accessibility\". So although the search facility on the Start menu is a big improvement, it didn't help here.<br></p>"
