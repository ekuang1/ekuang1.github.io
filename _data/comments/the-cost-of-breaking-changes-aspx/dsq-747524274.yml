message: "<p>I still think the backward compatibility thing isn't as big as deal as they make it seem.<br>Fact is, when I get a 3rd party library, it either:<br>A) Depends only and purely on the base framework. That is, 1.1, 2.0, 3.5, etc. Virtually all third party libs need to recompile for those, for a reason or another.<br>B) They depend on other stuff (like in the future the MVC framework), but also on 3rd party stuff themselves, who will not care as much about backward compatibility. So they need to pump out new versions all the time anyway.<br>So really, point is, we're USED to this by now....its the norm. So spending precious time and ressources (even though Microsoft has a lot, they still don't have unlimited manpower) on something that ultimately, will be for nothing: everyone will have to recompile for new versions of the framework, directly or indirectly. (Heck, even between themselves: I remember when the Enterprise Library 3.0 came out... they said that the WCSF would work out of the box...then that it would work with a recompile...and even that didn't work! They had to come out with a new version).</p>"
