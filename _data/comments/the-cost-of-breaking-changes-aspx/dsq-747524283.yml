message: <p>If I buy a component from a third party vendor and that vendor doesn't take the opportunity to upgrade their libraries during the extensive beta phases Microsoft typically offers, then I chose the wrong vendor.<br>Adding a property to an interface is a pretty serious breaking change, and it should not be done lightly; but if it needs to be done, then concerns about third-party vendors who don't upgrade their libraries should not stop it from happening. Until Microsoft gets over this phobia of breaking changes, the .NET framework is at serious risk of becoming hopelessly mired in the mistakes of its own past. That would be a terrible end for a platform which still has so much potential.<br>Breaking changes aside, ABCs are more often than not simply not appropriate. We all learn early on about inheritance and polymorphism; but hopefully we also learn that in most cases composition is more appropriate than inheritance, since the number of "is-a" relationships in most real-world applications is simply not very large. But composition requires interfaces. I am not going to compromise the design of my object model because the official Microsoft guidance is to use ABCs instead of interfaces, especially when I know that the justification for that guidance is an irrational fear of breaking changes.</p>
