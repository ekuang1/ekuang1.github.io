message: <p>@Ayende - I am not twisting your words.  I am puting them in the context of the blog on which you are responding and my earlier comment to which you were replying.  <br>I completely agree that there needs to be a balance, but other than the last 4 or 5 comments, I don't seen anyone advocating balance.  I see a bunch of comments on why Interfaces should be favored over ABCs and why breaking changes are acceptable.<br>In fact, in his first post advocating relaxing the restriction, David states very clearly that he does not have access to the data on how much of an impact relaxing the philosophy would have to Microsoft or to their customers.  So if the issue is on how relaxed Microsoft's stance should be WRT this issue, then who is most likely to have the applicable data on what the correct balance should be?  I would argue that 20 years of experience in dealing with Interfaces in C++ and COM, and 10 years in .Net has taught Microsoft quite a bit about what their customers will accept and won't accept in terms of breaking changes and Microsoft's ability to perform longterm maintenance on frameworks using interfaces.  Microsoft has not always had a philosophy that shied away from using interfaces in favor of ABCs, that is something that was developed over many years of getting beat up by customers and vendors.<br></p>
