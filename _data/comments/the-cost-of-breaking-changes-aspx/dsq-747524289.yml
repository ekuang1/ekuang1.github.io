message: <p>Whenever I see a MSFTie blog about backwards compatibility and breaking changes, the overwhelming majority of responses are in favor of relaxing the extreme stance toward breaking changes that .NET has exhibited so far. Yet you say:<br>"to the vast majority of clients out there, breaking changes is a big problem."<br>and<br>"we've already heard overwhelming feedback against breaking changes as much as possible."<br>Where is this feedback coming from, and why doesn't anyone else in the blogging community have visibility into it?</p>
