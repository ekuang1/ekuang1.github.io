message: <p>@Joe,<br>No one is saying that Microsoft shouldn't take backward compatibility into account. Obviously breaking changes are a huge pain both for component vendors and for end users. What we are saying is that they need to be giving less weight to backward compatibility issues and more weight to the future maintainability of the framework. Breaking changes cause pain once; leaving bugs or poorly designed APIs in the framework causes pain forever.<br>Your tongue-in-cheek comment about Haacked's rendering issues in IE8 brings up a perfect example. What if 10 years ago the major browsers had refused to change their rendering engines because it would have caused existing websites to "break"? Can you imagine the mess we would be in today? <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080303-sanity-prevails-ie8-will-default-to-standard-compliant-mode.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080303-sanity-prevails-ie8-will-default-to-standard-compliant-mode.html">This article</a> exactly mirrors the conversation we are having; in the end, the IE team decided that having a properly standards-compliant browser was more important than existing websites being able to rely on non-standard behavior in IE7. The .NET team needs to take a lesson from this decision.</p>
