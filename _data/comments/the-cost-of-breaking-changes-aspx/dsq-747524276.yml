message: <p>hgs - Think I found the scrollbar control in Vista for you. Try Control Panel -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Window Color and Appearance -&gt; Open classic appearance properties for more options -&gt; Advanced. Then select Scrollbar from the dropdown, and increase the size.<br>That Classic view is pretty much unchanged from XP, but it's much harder to reach now. It's also not indexed for the Control Panel search...</p>
