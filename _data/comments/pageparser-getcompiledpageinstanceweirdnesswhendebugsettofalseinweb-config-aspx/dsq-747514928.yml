message: <p>Excellent post Phil... and the article you linked to reguarding deployment of production code with the compilation flag is most certainly worth a read!<br>One question,<br>Did you get a chance to test your <i>hack</i> in a subText setup where there is an application configured? For example in my install, subText physically lives at the root of my site but has an application ("blog") configured. In this case I've had to actually create a physical folder named "blog" off of the site root and it contains only one file (named Default.aspx). This allows me to make a request for <a href="http://stevenharman.net/blog/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="stevenharman.net/blog/">stevenharman.net/blog/</a> and the URL rewriting works correctly.<br>So, I just one to make sure that a request for <a href="http://stevenharman.net/blog/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="stevenharman.net/blog/Default.aspx">stevenharman.net/blog/Defau...</a> will get correctly routed thru the URL rewriting framework as there is actually a file at that location. From the sound of your post, it will... but want to be sure.<br>Again, great work Phil!</p>
