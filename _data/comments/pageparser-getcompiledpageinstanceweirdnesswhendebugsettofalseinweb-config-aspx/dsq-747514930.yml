message: <blockquote>By the way, instead of configuring a subfolder named "blog", you could use our 404 handling to take care of it.</blockquote><p>Oh yeah! I did configure that the last time I deployed, but I forgot that it meant I no longer need the "subfolder for each blog" hack. I'll go ahead and remove the subfolder when I get home.<br>Good catch!</p>
