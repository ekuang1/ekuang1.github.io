message: <p>Well we both discuss the same topic, but it's clearly not plagiarism. The approach we take and the language used is very different. The only similarity is our use of <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar">metasynctatic variables foo.bar.baz</a>.</p>
