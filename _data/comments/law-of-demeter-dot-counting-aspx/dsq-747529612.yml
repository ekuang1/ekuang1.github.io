message: <p>Oh, the other similarity is that I reference and properly attribute the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/demeter-method/LawOfDemeter/paper-boy/demeter.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/demeter-method/LawOfDemeter/paper-boy/demeter.pdf">paperboy example</a> by David Bock.<br>The post you mentioned also uses that example but fails to attribute it. Perhaps that led to your false charge of plagiarism.</p>
