message: "<p>A piece of code that is designed to display an order does not need to know—and should not know—anything about customer names. To do so is not only a violation of the LoD, but it is also (more importantly) a bad design.</p><p>Is the customer name stored in one field or two or several? It is common to have first_name and last_name. It could also be prefix and sort_name, to better handle international names. Perhaps titles are stored separately. Perhaps there is a formal name and a familiar name. Is there a maximum length for the name?</p><p>Can any of these things change? And if they change, how much code is expected to change to support that?</p><p>Why should the programmer who is responsible for displaying orders need to get into the nuts-and-bolts of customer names?</p><p>The correct design clear and simple: The code that displays the order information does not display customer's names, but rather it displays a Customer. An entirely different piece of code will be responsible for figuring out how the customer is to be displayed.</p>"
