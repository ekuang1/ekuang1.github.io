message: <p>Well there is a mod that you can have done to your iPod from a company called <a href="http://www.ipodmods.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.ipodmods.com"> ipodmods.com</a> that can mod a 30 gig or an 80 gig case with a 100gb hard drive. It still has the photo and movie capabilities that you were asking about too, along being able to still use your iPod as an external harddrive. I think its such a great idea too, since I love my iPod for those reasons. You guys should check it out. <br><a href="http://www.ipodmods.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.ipodmods.com">www.ipodmods.com</a></p>
