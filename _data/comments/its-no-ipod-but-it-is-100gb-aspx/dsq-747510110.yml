message: <p>these dmc xclef 500's last a long time. my battery still last 8 hrs and my xclef 500 hard drive just died after about 45,000 hrs, 7yrs of use. I was just barely able to retrieve the syst files off the disc and transfered them to another hd. Had a 160gig hd, but had to format it to 100 gigs for the player to use it. I have copies of the file folders that I could post to a site, if it allowed me to. Too bad this site won't let me post files. I'm back up and running with 100gigs 'o music for another 7 years. Screw ipods-they don't last.</p>
