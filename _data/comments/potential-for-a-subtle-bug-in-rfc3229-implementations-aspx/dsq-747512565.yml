I believe other aggregators will follow suit.<br><br><br><br>The benefit over a static xml file is that when the xml file changes, the typical web server sends the ENTIRE file.  With RFC3229, I can send only the content that has changed.  A bit more server work, but less bandwidth.  <br><br><br><br>For me, I'm actually not too concerned about my own bandwidth since WebHost4Life doesn't give me a limit.
