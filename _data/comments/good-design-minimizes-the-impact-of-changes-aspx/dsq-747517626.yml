message: <p>I've been looking at the same type of problems lately.  I hate having to modify 6 different files, update the SPs, and then change all the UI for tiny little changes like the MiddleName field you described.<br>The best solution I've found includes using some type of O/R mapper for the DAL and entity classes.  If you can get support for partial classes in the code generator, it's a win/win for adding custom logic to business entities while letting the O/R mapper handle the first and subsequent generation of the DAL/entities (so code generation doesn't overwrite your custom code).<br><a href="http://www.nettiers.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nettiers.com/">.netTiers</a> is by far the best solution I've seen, and it's open source (but requires the use of <a href="http://www.codesmithtools.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.codesmithtools.com/">CodeSmith</a>).  It uses the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/EntLib2.asp" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/EntLib2.asp">Enterprise Library</a> under the covers and provides for a very nice level of abstraction (the DAL can even run against multiple db platforms)<br><a href="http://www.nettiers.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nettiers.com/">http://www.nettiers.com/</a><br>I'm looking forward to your followup post on this.<br><a href="http://www.evanhoff.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.evanhoff.com/">Evan</a> (a fellow SubText blogger)</p>
