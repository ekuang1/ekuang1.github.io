message: "<p>I'm ready for the solution to the first example!  For all the ORMs and DataSet, this is still my biggest time-consumer: new field in db -&gt; change DataSet (entity code, orm, etc) -&gt; change UI.  One \"solution\" would be untyped datasets, so your code would be new field in db -&gt; change UI.  But then you're introducing all sorts of code smells.  (Though I guess this is more or less the approach of a SqlDataSource &amp; GridView/FormView, which for cases not requiring much business logic, is pretty powerful...)</p>"
