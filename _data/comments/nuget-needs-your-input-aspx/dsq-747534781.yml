message: <p>I agree with all the dependency management comments; solution-level and project-level should both be supported. For those that aren't sure why you'd need different versions, sometimes you have multi-targeted apps in a solution and they can't work with the same versions. Ideally, they would, but sometimes legacy apps just aren't so nice :)<br>More importantly, and totally unrelated to dependencies, I'd really like to see better "help" management in NuGet. Unless you know the library, the Nuget manager just doesn't make it easy to figure out what you just installed, how you use it, and what it added to your project. Sometimes the "More Information" link doesn't cut it, because it goes to a generic project homepage instead of the documentation for Nuget installs.<br>This is made worse during upgrades... what the hell did they change, why is my code broken, I saw a note about "during an upgrade blah blah blah" but when I go back to the package manager I don't see the note again...<br>It's not necessarily the package creator's fault; I'd like to see better integration for external documentation WITHIN Nuget. A package creator can make the More Information link go to a Nuget help page but at least giving them the option to include install/upgrade notes during installation would be awesome. I admit I don't know a lot about Nuget package making... is it possible to provide this sort of thing and creators just don't do it?</p>
