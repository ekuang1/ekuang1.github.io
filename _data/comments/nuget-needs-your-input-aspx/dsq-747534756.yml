message: <p>With current NuGet version it is hard to manage packages in projects in solution. <br>For example, I need NHibernate 2.1 and install it to my Core library, but I also need it in my Web project. Now I cannot add already installed library, but have to install it again. And if I will not provide version it will install me 3d version of NHibernate. Removing it and installing right version is quite hard. <br>So installing packages to solution would be nice feature. But then we need also some action how to add these packages to particular projects.</p>
