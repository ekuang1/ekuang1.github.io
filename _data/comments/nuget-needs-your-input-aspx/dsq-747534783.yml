message: <p>Our solution has a couple "core" libraries, a test class library, two web applications and two console applications.<br>I've seen plenty of other solutions though with a couple "core" libraries and a single web application/or windows application. <br>I think it is fairly common to have console applications within the solution too. Hope that helps.<br>Kyle</p>
