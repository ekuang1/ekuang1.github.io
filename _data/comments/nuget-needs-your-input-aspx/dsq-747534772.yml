message: <p>I was the main developer on horn or hornget which you may have heard of.<br>I think we at least tried to fix the dependency issue albeit in a way that required buy in from all the OSS that I can muster.<br>I think openwrap is also trying to solve the dependency problem programatically but I am not sure how nuget tries to approach the problem apart from pretending it is not the package manager's problem.<br>This is the main problem with package management in .NET.  Dependencies, dependencies and dependencies.<br>Signed assemblies are a great evil in this area.</p>
