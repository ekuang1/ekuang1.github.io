message: <p>While having one version of a reference for all projects is the normal case in my projects, I really need the possibility to set individual versions. For me it would be nice if there was some sort of overview dialog where all projects of the solution are shown together with the version of each reference and allowing me to update individual or multiple references at once. <br>Cheers<br>Urs</p>
