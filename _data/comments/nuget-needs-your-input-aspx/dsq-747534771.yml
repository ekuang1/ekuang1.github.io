message: <p>I was also under the impression that a package was only added to the project, not to the solution, glad to know that it is actually done right!<br>Having multiple versions of a same external assembly sounds 'smelly' to me, I just don't see any cases where this would be absolutely required (sounds like I would rather split my solution in multiple parts...).</p>
