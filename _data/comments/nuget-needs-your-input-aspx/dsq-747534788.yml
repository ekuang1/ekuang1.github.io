message: <p>Hi @Robert et al, we're not trying to overcomplicate NuGet, but looking at possible simplifications.<br>We already support multiple versions of a package in the same solution today, and that's the thing we're thinking of changing. For example:<br>  Solution has Project A and Project B<br>  Install Log4Net 1.0 in Project A.<br>  Install Log4Net 1.1 in Project B.<br>  You now have both Log4Net 1.0 and 1.1 installed in your solution.<br>  1.0 in Project A, and 1.1 in Project B. <br>What we're thinking about doing is making it so that you can't get into this situation.<br>Thus the change we're considering is:<br>  Solution has Project A and Project B<br>  Install Log4Net 1.0 in Project A.<br>  Install Log4Net 1.1 in Project B.<br>  Now both Projects have Log4Net 1.1 installed. <br>However, this has big implications. What if you really wanted different versions? The change we're considering is an all or nothing change. It's a lot of work to try and support both models moving forward. So we want to know how many people we will piss off if we go with this new behavior. :)</p>
