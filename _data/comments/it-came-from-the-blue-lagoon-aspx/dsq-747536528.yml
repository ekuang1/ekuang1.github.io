message: <p>Iceland is amazing. Was visiting friends few months back.<br>It's such a raw country. The elements really still rule everything.<br>I had my hottest bath ever right in some somewhat hidden underground spring untill I almost fainted. After which I walked up a dormant vulcano where snow froze my face off.<br>Sulfur and wind are just everywhere. Whalewatching is cool too.<br>Bouldering and hiking opportunities for those who are interested.</p>
