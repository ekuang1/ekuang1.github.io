message: <p>Hi Roy!!<br>I haven't tested it but what would happen if the code I'm testing in my unit test uses manual transactions?<br>Because this solution uses COM+, COM+ doesn't accept both enterprise transactions and manual transactions so I think an error would be raised.<br>What do you think?</p>
