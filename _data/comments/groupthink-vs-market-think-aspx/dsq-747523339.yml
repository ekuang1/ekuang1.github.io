message: <p>Excellent leadership trumps them all.<br>Groupthink is beautifully expressed at <a href="http://www.despair.com/meetings.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.despair.com/meetings.html">http://www.despair.com/meet...</a>.<br>I am afraid miss the association between predictive markets and corporate decision making, especially related to setting vision and direction from a gifted leader.  I don't see excellent products coming to us (ex. the iPod, <a href="http://et.al" rel="nofollow noopener" title="et.al">et.al</a>.) coming to us from crowd wisdom.<br>While crowds may predict well, I see mediocrity (or worse) from the crowd when it comes to design, direction, and leadership.<br>I guess I'm just missing how prediction markets are related at all to the business/product decision making process.  <br>As an example, I would rather have Rob in charge of SubSonic's direction than having a crowd in charge.  Give me a talented leader over a crowd any day.</p>
