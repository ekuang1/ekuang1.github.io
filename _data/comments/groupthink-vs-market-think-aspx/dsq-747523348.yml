message: <p>Actually it was called the Policy Analysis Market, and it suffered from numerous problems.  Again, because a market is useful at selecting the best product or idea, not necessarily in predicting.  I've watched political markets, which claim to predict, and they generally just track conventional wisdom.<br>There's utility in markets, but just because you have a hammer doesn't mean everything is a nail.  Sometimes an educated guess can be way more useful.<br></p>
