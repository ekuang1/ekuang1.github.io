message: <p>Very thought provoking post!<br>I think there's an interesting aspect to the granularity of the decisions the groups are making. For instance, the prediction markets for the Oscars didn't design a movie star, they guessed which of an existing set of stars were most likely to win an Oscar. If you start averaging at the feature level, you end up with a mess, but if you use popular input to decide between less granular options (overall product visions, feature sets, etc.), you can get the advantage of popular input without creating a mess.<br>The average of everyone's favorite color is probably an ugly brown color, which wouldn't be anyone's favorite color. Better to come up with a short list of popular colors and have a winner take all vote.<br>As "The Other Steve" pointed out, many people lie (unintentionally) when directly surveyed. It's much better to collect votes from actual measured input - A/B tests, feature use tracking in software, etc. If you asked me what music I've been listening to lately, I guarantee I won't be as accurate as my <a href="http://last.fm" rel="nofollow noopener" title="last.fm">last.fm</a> profile.</p>
