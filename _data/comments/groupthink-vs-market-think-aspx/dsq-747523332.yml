message: <p>I was once called in to a marketing survey at the Mall of America, becuase they were trying to figure out how to attract more locals.  This was a group of 10 men age 25-40, the target audience of this particular program.<br>When prompted, 9 men responded with things like "Oh yeah sure, if you brought in sports stars I would come here with my son to see them."  I responded "Wouldn't make a difference.  Only reason I come here is if there is something I want to buy that I can't get anywhere else, or it's a convenient location to meet buddies for a beer."<br>I was the only honest person in the bunch.<br>The rest of the group all fed upon one another, prompted by the marketing person.  They just wanted to agree.<br>Now I was in a focus group once where we got into a big fight, but that's because it involved politics about low priced housing.<br>The problem is to many companies rely upon those marketing focus groups to make product decisions, not realizing that the results are skewed from the start to support their preconceived notions.  Then they wonder why nobody shows up to buy when the stats had 80% favorable.<br></p>
