message: <p>@Mads - Fantastic question! Probably worth a post in its own right. Some quick thoughts:<br>I think it's possible to foster a group culture that avoids some of the symptoms of group think. For example, egoless programming is one approach to this. We all want the best technical solution to a problem.<br>But in terms of how the core group makes internal decisions, I think having a strong vision is important. I have a particular idea of how I want Subtext to be and I want to stick to that at the risk of making some people unhappy, with the hope of making those that get my vision really happy.<br>I think you do the same with BlogEngine.NET because I know there are certain philosophical differences in approach you and I have (namely in regards to 3rd party dependencies). I think that's a good thing!</p>
