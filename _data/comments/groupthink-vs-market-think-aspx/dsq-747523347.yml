message: <p>@Jon - but one thing to consider is that well designed markets aren't designed to get the average of people's favorites. They're designed to get what people actually think is best, all biases aside (as much as humanly possible of course).<br>So while there are certain actors I don't like, I might buy their stock because I know they will rise in price.<br>Another case in point is the "Foreign Policy" market which was unfortunately labelled a terrorism market. They had foreign analysts buy shares of how, when, and where the next attack would occur. When prices went up on a "share", they knew there was a worry there.<br>Markets are a great way to dissemminate intel in that case.</p>
