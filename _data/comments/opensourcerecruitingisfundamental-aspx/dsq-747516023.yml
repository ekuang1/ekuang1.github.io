message: <p>Sally Struthers is the one that does the "Please feed the children" commercials while looking like she hasn't missed a meal in quite some time. Sommers hawks the thighmaster. Although, quite a few OSS devs  (including myself) could use one of those.<br>Please, won't you help the OSS devs by dontaing a thighmaster?<br>I think the low participation rate is due to developers egos. You have a TON of article/blogs/forum posters saying "you have to do it THIS way or else your code is crap." So that scares away the newbies because they think "Man, my code isn't good enough to be used in this project.". Then some devs look at the source to the project and think, "god this code is crap. Why would I want to work on this eyesore when I could create my own masterpiece PLUs it'll have x functionality."<br>On a side note. It took your JS preview a good 30 seconds to catch up after I finished writing the end of this sentence. Backspaces and all. Firefox 1.5.0.5 under OS X with 7 tabs open.</p>
