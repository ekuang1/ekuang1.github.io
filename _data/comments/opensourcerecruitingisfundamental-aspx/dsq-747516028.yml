message: "<p>I was going to post a comment along the lines of Scott's comment. I judged myself as a medium-advanced developer, but certainly not a rockstar, and I'm simply too afraid to \"look for a job\" at a open source project. And I think there are two different factors that add to that reluctance to approach OS projects: first, the \"I'm not half as good a programmer as these guys are, I'm going to be scorned\" factor and then the \"How can I beguin?\" factor. Maybe, *maybe*, if some OS projects were advertising for help along the lines: \"HELP WANTED - You can also help if you're a newbie\" and then reserve somme less complicated programming tasks to the uninitiated, maybe it should be more easier to people to stick to the project and advance with it afterwards.<br>Of course, these would require effort (ergo, time) from some of the people already working at the project, and I know that time is always difficult to find, but still... My 2 cents.</p>"
