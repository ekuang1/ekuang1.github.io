message: <p>When DotNetNuke needed additional resources beyond what pure volunteers could offer, we looked at the donation model.  Based on our history and the history of every major OS project that published their financials (Firefox, JBOSS, Apache and a few others), we found that the donation model just will not cover expenses.  People assume that you can run an Open Source project for free, and you can up to a certain point.  But as proven by the NDoc project, if you want the project to be able to continue even in the face of ongoing challenges of life, you have to be able to build a team and ultimately you will need to generate some revenue.  DotNetNuke has been fortunate to find some corporate sponsors for bandwidth and hosting and software, but other costs like legal fees have to come out of pocket.  If your project needs revenue to deal with dedicated resources (hardware, software, development and/or management), we found that the donation model doesn't always work.</p>
