message: <p>Hi, I run a Linux Jobboard and want to inform you, that i will put any voluntary open source projects for free up in my board to spread the word as in "But by no means limit yourself to SourceForge. Consider putting a free ad in CraigsList or in the forums of other developer communities." - that's exactly what i'm offering on my open source jobboard for the community.<br>Greetings and looking forward to any replies<br>Lukas</p>
