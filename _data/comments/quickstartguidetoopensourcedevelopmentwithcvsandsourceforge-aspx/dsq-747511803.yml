message: <p>Cool article.  Now where were you 3 months ago when I was trying to get SSH working right on Windows.<br><br><br><br>I was also using WinCVS on my PC and have switched over to using TortoiseCVS.  So far I l perfer the TortoiseCVS File Explorer integration over the application view of WinCVS.<br><br><br><br>We've now been using CVS for all our projects over VSS because of the fact it works so well over the internet and we don't have to spend 100 a user for a product like Source Offsite which has its own share of problems.<br><br><br><br><br><br>A great book on CVS is Essential CVS by O'Reilly.  While its geared toward Unix/Linux users, Windows users can benefit from it as well.</p>
