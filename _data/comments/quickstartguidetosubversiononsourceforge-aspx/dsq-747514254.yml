message: <p>Simo...<br><br>I'm not sure if you saw the comment I made here [<a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/17/WhatEveryDeveloperShouldKnowAboutSourceControl.aspx#11847" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/17/WhatEveryDeveloperShouldKnowAboutSourceControl.aspx#11847">https://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/17/WhatEveryDeveloperShouldKnowAboutSourceControl.aspx#11847</a>], but I was really tempted to "push the button" the other day.  But then logic set in and I knew it was not the time... but I'll be pushing for a move to SVN soon after the 1.0 release... so soon!<br><br><br><br>Great article Phil! I too hope that this will help ease people into getting involved with/contributing to Open Source projects.<br><br><br><br>Now, I can't wait 'till _someone out there_ writes an app to tightly integrate SVN into Visual Studio. Though, on second thought... I've really gotten used to the TortoiseCVS/TortoiseSVN way of doing things through the windows explorer. But, then on a 3rd hand... I do love how Eclipse/Rational Application Developer [RAD] integrate so well with ClearCase in my work environment.</p>
