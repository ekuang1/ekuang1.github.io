message: <p>I guess I kind of said the above a bit tounge-in-cheek...<br><br><br><br>However, I shouldn't sell anyone short as I've not tried Ankh in a long time (over  year at least). I pseudo-evaluated it for version control of my own side projects and I ran into all kinds of issues. Though, in hind site I'm sure many of those were due to user (my) error. I say pseudo-evaluated b/c shortly there-after I started working with subText, and at that time my "side project" (my own dotText install) when by the wayside.<br><br><br><br>At any rate, once we move subText to SVN I'll be sure to give Ankh another shot, and no doubt be surprised at how well it works.</p>
