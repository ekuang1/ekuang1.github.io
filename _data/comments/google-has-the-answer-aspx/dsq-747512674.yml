message: <p>This is from my favourite book.<br>The answer to the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe, and Everything is forty-two.<br>The Ultimate Question does NOT exist, so do not contemplate it too much. There are some funny coincidences, but in reality, Douglas Adams admits to making it up at random. The question is NOT "What do you get if you multiply six by nine?", because it is clearly noted in the story that the question Arthur conjures is only a distortion of the actual question, because of his ancestry of Golgafrinchans, who weren't actual natives of the Earth but rather idiotic aliens.</p>
