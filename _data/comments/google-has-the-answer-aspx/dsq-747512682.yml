message: <p>The answer to life is indeed 42, the reason are more obscure than most of you would think at first. This information, I gather over many years of research. First 4 is the first most important number after 3, which is the 3rde most important number excluding 0. And the second number 2, is also the second number in the answer, coincidence  I reckon. But it is also a factor of the first number, therefore if 4=a then 42 = 2a/2 which is a. And if a is any variable then the answer to life is anything.</p>
