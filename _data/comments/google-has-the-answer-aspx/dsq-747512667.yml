message: <p>Charles it's not the answer but the travel to the answer that makes the answer to 42. <br>So getting there will in the end spell out to be 42. <br>if you think back. <br>how many searches did i do before i found the answer? 42<br>how many years did it take me to find the answer? 42<br>what shoe size does the guy at my left have? 42<br>how many carlsbergs can i drink before getting the answer? 42<br>so in the end everything you do before you find the question have be in the term of 42. <br>when you have done that you will find the question to your answer.<br>but then again your question might not be the same of mine.</p>
