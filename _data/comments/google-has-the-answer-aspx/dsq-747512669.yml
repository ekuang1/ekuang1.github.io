message: <p>The Answer To Life The Universe and Everything<br>is very hard to find. However I feel connected to the world in a big way which means I have a better chance of finding the answer then others. If anyone is reading this think deepley to yourself and try and find your own answer. I do not now the answer but I ment somebody who dose. Please leave a comment about what I am saying so we can work together to find the person who knows the answer to everything. By the way the only thing this person told [related to the question]  me was that he couldnt tell me the answer but I would have to band together with a few people and go around the world if a wanted the ture. This person also told me not to work too much unless you like your job a fair amount and if you are happy and active you will find out knew information on finding the answer</p>
