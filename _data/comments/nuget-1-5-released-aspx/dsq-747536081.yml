message: <p>@Chris, are you running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003? If so, this is a <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/known-issues" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/known-issues">known issue</a> with those operating systems and there's not much we can do about it. The vast majority of folks aren't having signing issues with NuGet.</p>
