message: <p>Hi,<br>i have just started working on the Log4net and found this discussion very helpful. i am working on a application which is using ASP and .net components. We are in middle of transition from ASP to <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> but want to use Log4Net with Asp pages. <br>Is that possible and how to configure log4net for this. Any help on this would be great.<br><br></p>
