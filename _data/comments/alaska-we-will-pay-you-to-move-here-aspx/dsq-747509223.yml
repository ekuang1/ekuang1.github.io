message: <p>I accidentally stumbled across this little rant while I was researching Alaska for my honeymoon. We just got back from a week staying in Anchorage and flying, boating, and 4-wheeling around the area. Alaska is an incredible place! I was born and raised on the gulf beaches in Sarasota, Fl and I'll be honest, this is the first time I've returned home and Florida just seems boring and ugly! Of course, come January I may have a different take! <br><br>  We were pleasantly surprised at how friendly and definitely not-backward everyone was. I guess we didn't meet Todd the math wiz. Your comparison of 500,000 people splitting 1,000,000,000 to 600,000 splitting 2,000,000,000 is, for lack of a better word, idiotic. You have to compare apples to apples. 500,000 people splitting 1,000,000 compared to 600,000 splitting 1,000,000 is the correct comparison. Get out your sticky little calculator.<br><br>So even if the market skyrockets but more people live there, you may get a bigger check but it's less than it would have been with less people sharing it.<br><br>   If you are going to be stupid, be quiet.<br><br>   If you are going to be arrogant, be right.<br><br>   Being arrogant AND stupid is rediculous.<br><br>As awesome as Alaska is, $1000 would not even pay for the coats, boots, hats, gloves, and flashlights I would need for the first winter. For me, it remains the absolute best place to VISIT. :)</p>
