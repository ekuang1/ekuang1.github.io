message: <p>i'm a senior in high school and i heard about the benefits you can receive from moving to alaska and i was convinced.  i've been researching apartments and jobs available in anchorage but am scared that even with all my research i still wont find a job or a place to live in.  not only that, i've dragged two of my friends in my adventure.  i currently live in california which would be a big change.  everything would be different for me.  but im ready for something new.  i was wondering if you could send me information on how to get started.  i'm planninng to move as soon as i get enough money.  however much that is.  the only problem is i am currently not employed.  i know this sounds dour but i m motivated to move there.  i just need some extra help and information.</p>
