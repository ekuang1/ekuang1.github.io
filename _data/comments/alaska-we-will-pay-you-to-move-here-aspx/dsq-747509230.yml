message: <p>Hi Larry, you are really dumb. You should slit your throat. For some reason, you think that investment principle will forever stay the same. Oil taxes continue to build the principle every year. You really have no idea what you're talking about. What a dork.<br><br><br><br>Now that you're bored, please go away. You are not a worthy opponent. You can't write English properly and you bore me.<br><br><br><br>I think you must be 14 years old and just having fun between surfing porn on your mom's computer. Any sensible adult would know when to shut up - you obviously don't.<br><br><br><br>BTW, are the "everglades" close to the "Everglades"?</p>
