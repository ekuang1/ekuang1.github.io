message: <p>I am just dumbfounded.  NO they don't pay to LIVE in Alaska.  Yes they pay you.  Someone needs to get educated here.  You don't get paid to just live in Alaska.  First of all, you have to be a resident here.  Change your voting and everything over.  You have to plan on staying here.  You receive money because in Alaska the oil belongs to the people.  So in October of every year, everyone gets a check, infants to elderly.  Here is the thing, whoever the idiot is thats saying, HEY everyone come to Alaska...thats money out of your pocket babe.  The more people that move here, the less money YOU get.  It is split between all residents.  So yeah..recruit people to take your money.  Thats real bright.  By the way, it gets like -30 in December and it is daylight about 2 hours. It is now April and it snowed 2 days ago.  We have earthquakes every day, only the big ones are felt.  You should check all that out too...oh yeah, and whats worse is, there's no target, no burger King, no Kmart, no Super walmart,  no Jack In the Box, no Olive Garden, Marie Calendars, Mi Mi's Cafe, Romono's Macaroni Grill...No Sonic.  Still wanna come?  =)  Oh and you can drive across the largest city here in about 15 minutes, in traffic.</p>
