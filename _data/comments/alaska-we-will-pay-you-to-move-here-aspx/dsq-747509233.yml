message: <p>Hahahahahahah. That was so good. The irony. The humor. The joke upon joke. Wow, this Larry guy sure knows his business - and a business of funny stuff it is!<br><br><br><br>Lar, you have now fulfilled the purpose of your existence, the reason you were born. You no longer need to pretend. You no longer need to feel the way you do. You may now proceed to slit your wrists and end the pain for all of us.<br><br><br><br>The double-posting was a great idea too. Finish your thoughts, write them down, post them and the repeat. Lar, were you reading blog commenting instructions off of a shampoo bottle? What a silly boy you are.<br><br><br><br>Nice try. Not at all original, nothing as exciting as a bag of wet hair...but nice try.<br><br><br><br>You do need some help:<br><br>"Since you are obviously a big player in the financial market, why are you in Alaska? Why not make some real money in New York?"<br><br>- New York is an overpriced speculative market where people get poor. I invest in Hong Kong, the greatest real estate market in the world. Then again, you don't have any idea about financial markets because money blows up your ass from a gust of wind.<br><br><br><br>"Thank you for noticing I didn't capitalize my e. That was really bothering me."<br><br>- Your English teacher should have repeatedly slapped you in the face.<br><br><br><br>"I must try harder in the future to aviod spelling, grammar, and typing errors at any cost."<br><br>- It's not "grammar" you moron, it's syntax. Your English teacher should have repeatedly slapped you in the face.<br><br><br><br>"Gotta admit, man, that throat-slitting idea grows on ya after awhile."<br><br>- "Gotta" and "ya" are not English. What are you Larry, Al-Qaida?</p>
