message: <p>I have lived here my whole entire life (20 years).  I don't know why...my family was never into snowmachining or hunting or fishing or anything "Alaskan" really.  I am just now starting to do these things.  Anyway, I always wanted to get the hell out of here as soon as possible, I couldn't WAIT to turn 18 and drive south and never look back.  But something changed.  One day I looked around and saw -for the first time- how truly beautiful everything around me was and I knew that it was home for me.  When you leave they always say "You'll be back" and I think for the most part that is true.  The winter is tough, and it lasts MOST of the year.  It is dark and cold, all the time.  We have a very high percentage of drug addicts and alcoholics (I believe that has a lot to do with the winters, and the effect that a lack of sunlight has on a person's brain)  I hope to travel and maybe live other places in my life, but I know that this will always be my home. K.  Just had to get that out.<br>Love, Lotus</p>
