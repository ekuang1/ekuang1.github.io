message: <p>Florida Larry, go back to your swamps, no one wants you in Alaska. We actually hate you and your family and wish you were dead. <br><br><br><br>I guess you have never earned money in your life via an investment, so you don't have a clue what ROI, IRR and NPV mean. Yeah, I knew you would go look those up. Let me put it this way Lar, if you made $10,000 last year (which you probably did) and $10,000 this year, you have actually made 3% less this year? Why, because of the annual 3% inflation in the US. You would have had to have made $10,300 to have made the same amount as last year. But according to you and your Florida Ph.D. in Economics, you'd be "comparing apples to apples" and "would've made the same amount".<br><br><br><br>What a Florida swamp hick! Do they teach you how to wipe your ass down there or does that require too much brain power? <br><br><br><br>I would call you "rediculous", but that is not a word in the English language so I guess it wouldn't mean much. Maybe it means somthing in the gibberish language of Florida.</p>
