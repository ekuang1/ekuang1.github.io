message: <p>I won't get into an argument over how much money either of us makes, because online everybody is nine feet tall, bad ass, and rich. Whatever.<br><br>I have made out pretty damn good on my investments. I don't pretend to be a wall street fund manager, but math is not that mysterious. No matter what the rate of return, inflation, how much you blow or reinvest, whatever amount you choose to disburse is divided among the recipients. If you divide it between 2 people they get more than if you divided it among 3. <br><br> Now if you decide to give each person a set amount no matter what percentage of your earnings that turns out to be, that's a different story. Problem is, eventually, if enough people recieve that set amount you give away all your profits and get into the principal. Unless of course you get 100%-175% per year like you. <br><br>Nice that you impress yourself in your high school economics class.<br><br>You're obviously either a pimply faced teenager or a joke of an adult.<br><br>Sarasota is a long way from the everglades. You do know your little globe is not actual size, right?<br><br>I'll never get so rich I stop eating mac-n-cheese.<br><br>I'm not a hate monger, I'm having fun. I am starting to get bored with this pointless thread, though.<br><br>I don't even like Shakespeare. or Oprah or Hillary Clinton while I'm at it</p>
