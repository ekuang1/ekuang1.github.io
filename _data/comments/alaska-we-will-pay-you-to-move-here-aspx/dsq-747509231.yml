message: <p>I know the principle will grow, but that's not what's in question. I was keeping the example simple. No matter what the principle, interest, inflation, cost of coffee beans, whatever, if you have a certain amount to divide up (no matter how big or small that year) the more people you divide it up between, the less they'll each get.<br><br>I wouldn't trust your financial advice, so I'll probably pass on the throat-slitting advice.<br><br><br><br>Since you are obviously a big player in the financial market, why are you in Alaska? Why not make some real money in New York?<br><br><br><br>Thank you for noticing I didn't capitalize my e. That was really bothering me.<br><br><br><br>I must try harder in the future to aviod spelling, grammar, and typing errors at any cost.<br><br><br><br>Gotta admit, man, that throat-slitting idea grows on ya after awhile.  <br><br><br><br>Nah, got too much work to do. Maybe later.<br><br><br><br></p>
