message: <p>I just read all of the above comments. First off, as like anyplace in the world there are pros and cons to this state.<br><br><br><br>It does infact take AT the very LEAST 30mins to get from Dimond to Glenn (I drive all day long) and Anchorage doesn't stop at Dimond either, nor is the Glenn Highway where it starts. So lets say you live as far back into Mt.View, and needed to get to D'Armoun? Try 30mins even if you took the highway all the way down.<br><br><br><br>And why would driving time being only 30mins across the state's biggest city a con anyway? When I went to Toronto and Chicago, even Detroit, I found myself getting very impatient with the traffic.<br><br><br><br>We do however have earthquakes everyday, almost every hour. But they are too small to feel, but it is normal activity for anyplace that is located on a fault line... such as Washington, Oregon, and California as well.<br><br><br><br>We get a dividend, and I'm no expert on the oil industry, but yes the funds are because "the people" of Alaska technically own it. I do know that over the past few years our dividends have gotten smaller do to flux in the market, but more residence shouldn't effect this number. And the dividend can really help out, especially larger families that are providing for 5 or more children. Dividends for you're children if you choose not to file for them, will be up for them to get ALL at once when they turn 18 (sounds like a good savings idea for when they want to move out of the house) <br><br><br><br>I do think the smallest amount of sun Anchorage gets is 6 hours. But the summer is so great that it almost offsets any cons from the winter, It's sunny, beautiful, and the sun sometimes doesn't set until 1:00am the next morning, to only rise again at 4:00am the same day. <br><br><br><br>It would be safe to say though, that Alaska is best suited for those who love the outdoors.<br><br><br><br>No wo don't pay sales tax, (even if we go to specific states in the US we can show our Alaska state ID and not have to pay the sales tax while visiting either)<br><br><br><br>The biggest con in MY opinion, would be this time of year "break up season" It's a rollercoaster ride with mother nature, and sometimes it seems as though summer will never come. but it will, as it always has, and it will be gorgeous, as always. I can't wait!</p>
