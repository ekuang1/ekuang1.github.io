message: <p>yeah<br><br>the state(in alaska (esp. fairbanks) we take that to be us, as in you and me, the folk, the citizens that is not the queen, the govenor or the government owns the "state" and its goodies...thus the "states" cut of the oil revenues(prudhoe bay was one of the first land selections make by the state from the u.s. government- a very smart geologist, that and the fact there has always been oil sepages on the "pristine" tundra) belongs, in a very direct way to me as an alaska...more or less thats the deal...and a grand in fairbanks only covers a good part of the years heating costs...so while its nice indeed(and oil revenue lets us not pay income taxes) it ain't really all that much...for me the joy or attraction to, in me case interior, alaska is the lack of negative stuff...hard to name any single thing but the lack of negatives that so much of the lower 48 is burdened with...more or less freedom i guess...people(and the government) let you be, which is a very nice thing...</p>
