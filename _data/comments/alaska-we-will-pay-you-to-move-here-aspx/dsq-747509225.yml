message: <p>What the hell does inflation have to do with dividing up the dividends? If the principal is a certain amount, it earns a certain amount of interest, then you divide up a portion of that interest between the people who are eligible, then the more people eligible to recieve money, the less they each get.<br><br>Sure, I make ten grand a year and still find extra money to travel the world, genius.<br><br>You hate not only me, but my family too? I haven't any words.<br><br>I didn't know that I was talking to the guy who is personally responsible for deciding who gets to live in Alaska and who has to eek out a miserable existence in the swamp. Are you sure you're not confusing Florida with Louisiana? I see you're having trouble in math, maybe geography doesn't come so easily for you either.<br><br>I won't resort to insulting an entire state because on one knucklehead. I'm sure regular Alaskans are embarrassed of your kind anyway.<br><br>Yes, I did spell ridiculous wrong, I take my lashing in silence.<br><br>We only speak gibberish when we sell underwater real estate to each other, throws the northerners off.</p>
