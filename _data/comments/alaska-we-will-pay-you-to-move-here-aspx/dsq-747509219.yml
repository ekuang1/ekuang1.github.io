message: <p>Thank you Haacked. Things were starting to get get a bit heated there. I appreciate your page here. To your readers...Yes, Alaska is a harsh yet beautiful and mystical place to live, it is not for everyone. If you like all those chain stores, they are not here, but still available online. I have not been here long enough to have receiceved my PFD yet and although I do look foward to it, really look foward to it, I would live here PFD or not. I live in the Interior (near Fairbanks), it got down to -40 for a week this winter. Schools are not even cancelled until it hits -60!! The high last summer was around 100!  I do not have the words to tell you all what an amazing and bewildering place this is.</p>
