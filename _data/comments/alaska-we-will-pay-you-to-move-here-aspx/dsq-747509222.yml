message: <p>I'm feeling the love, people.  I really am.  They say you either love Alaska, or hate it.  Money or not, if you hate it, no amount of money is worth it.  And, the dividend fund wouldn't do it for me if I hated it.  Aside from all the talk of earthquakes, eating greasy chicken from a box, Walmart or no Walmart...  There were a few here who wanted to know the best way to find employment and move.  Can't we all just get along and welcome them to the "family" that is Alaska?  I would like to know myself!  I was born in Anchorage.  My parents took me "outside" on vacation when I was young, and never returned to AK.  Now, I'm planning on moving back within the next 2 years.  Cruising the net to find information or contacts is TRULY a pain in the hiney.  I'm not concerned with living near a Walmart... don't care if I ever see one again!  I just want to live in a safe neighborhood.  Forget about the PFD, I just want to find a darn JOB there so that I won't end up on the streets after I move.  I don't CARE how cold it is or if it's the same temperature as the Great Lakes area...  It could be just as warm as it is here in Virginia, and I still wouldn't want to live on the streets!  It's clear that there are people on this site who are from Anchorage and I'd appreciate hearing from ANY of you.  I'm not choosing sides in any arguement, cause you know what... it's all about me!  I want to move, I need info, I want connections and friends there BEFORE I move.  So, if your computers haven't been knocked out from all the felt or unfelt earth tremors, please email me at Clmeauchoo@yahoo.com.  After I've gotten my first PFD check, I'll split it between all of those who helped me get there!</p>
