message: <p>I'd like to welcome them all, where else do you find bears strolling through your neighborhood.  Bring em on, maybe one of em will buy my house for 1/4 million; for that is what the average cost of a house for a family of 3 is today in Anchorage.  They'll need that $1000 given each year to offset the cost of housing and gas.  Yes we pay more for gas than you in the lower 48.  Sounds crazy uh, but true.</p>
