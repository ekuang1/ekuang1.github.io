message: <p>I just want to know how these folks on the Alaskan Frontier show on the Discovery Channel are making a living? I mean they have tractors, trucks, boats, houses, machinery for milling wood, buying fuel, clothes and etc. Where do they get the funds to do all of this?Â  You will only see these people collecting food and such for the long winters to survive. Where does there income come from to pay for all of there things?</p>
