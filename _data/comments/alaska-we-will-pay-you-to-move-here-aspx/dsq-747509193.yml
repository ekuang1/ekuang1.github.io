message: <p>lisielove, sounds like you don't have a clue as to what you're talking about. Are you one of those Cheechakos that just read up on Alaska and now think you're an expert on the oil economy, traffic patterns and retail businesses?<br><br><br><br> - Yes, you get paid to live in AK.<br><br> - No, it's not true that the more people are in AK the less money you get. The money disbursed is completely based on return on investments from the oil money, with a portion taken out for reserves. If there are 1 million people in AK and returns are great, every one would see even more money.<br><br> - No, you're wrong on the traffic. Anchorage takes 30 minutes to get across in traffic at 5pm, from Dimond to the Glenn Highway.<br><br> - Super Walmart is being put in off of Lake Otis. The regular Walmart on Northern Lights is one of the highest grossing Walmarts in the U.S.<br><br> - It will almost never be 30 below in Anchorage. That's more like Fairbanks and above. Anchorage gets 6 hours of sunlight a day in January only - and that is the lowest.<br><br> - There are not earthquakes every day in AK. That is a myth. But there are earthquakes every day all around the world, Ms. Geologist.<br><br> - Jack in the Box is off the Old Seward and the Minnesota Highway.<br><br><br><br>Anyone BESIDES LISIELOVE is welcome to come to Alaska.</p>
