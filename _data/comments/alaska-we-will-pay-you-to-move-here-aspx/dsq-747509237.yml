message: <p>You people are morons.  They don't "pay you" to  live here.  The PFD is a result of the massive money the state makes for using up our natural resources.  It's like a kick down.  The amount you get each year depends on many factors.  Last year it was LESS THAN a grand, and is consistantly getting smaller. By the time you qualify after living here for 2 YEARS, the amounnt might be closer to 500 bucks, That's not even enough to pay a month's rent in most places. This is  not a reason to move up here! The cost of living is much higher than most places in the Lower 48.  Many types of jobs and career opportunities are simply not available here.  DO NOT simply pack up and move here and expect everything to work out.  PLAN, SAVE, and  make sure you have some sort of employment lined up.  The summer is very short and I have seen many misguided folks starving in the cold because they were not financially prepared for the Alaskan Lifestyle.  We do not need anymore beggers and vagrants on the streets of downtown Anchorage.</p>
