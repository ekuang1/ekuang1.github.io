message: <p>jezum crow, i just wanted to look for Cpt Jeff Weeks of the Billikin. I was going to offer him a warm bath, a cold beer and a promise to make him breakfast, if he can last through the night! haha( I'm 5'11,  110lbs, 23 years old, blonde and blue 36-24-36.....no wait............I'm 58 years old, 5'2, 208 lbs, black hair/ grey eyes, 32-40-38.....)<br><br>     "He" is the only reason I would move there for sure!    Reading up on todd/lesilove reminded me of the time i spent baby sitting my two year old nieces!!!! Oh well, everyones got issues, aye? As long as they are busy c/ the puters, i guess the streets/innocent children/bars/virgins and the rain forest will do just fine! <br><br>oh look at me, now  i've started to rant &amp; rave. God bless the first ammendment indeed!!  Pardon me while I cool off, the sheer power of stating my thoughts almost went to my head. ( somebody hose me down, please) <br><br>soooo correct my spelling if you must dear, make fun of my cute little accent, should that make you feel better, but if anyone sees cpt weeks around, tell him i said hello!<br><br><br><br>p.s. those vital stats above? jeff dear, i'm somewhere in between. kinda like Goldilocks...JUST RIGHT!!!!  take care poopie!..............ruthie<br><br></p>
