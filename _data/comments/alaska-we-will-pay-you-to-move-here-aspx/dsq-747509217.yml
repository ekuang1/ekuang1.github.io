message: <p>So Lisielove, Alaska's good enough for you, but not for others?  Come on now.<br><br><br><br>Have you no sense of humor? <br><br><br><br>Let me spell it out for you in simple terms.  The jab I was taking is that Alaska is so harsh, they have to pay you to live there.  This, my dear, is a joke.  <br><br><br><br>Certainly, Alaska is a hardy place, and not a place for the weak willed (although I'd mention that Anchorage is quite mild compared to the interior, or even northern Minnesota).<br><br><br><br>However, like you, I believe it is a beautiful and wonderful place to live, should you be inclined to a cold climate.  And if you're moving to Alaska solely for the Permanent Fund, you're making a big mistake.  There are many other reasons to love Alaska.  The Permanent fund does not make up for the cost of living.  So again, it was a tongue in cheek reference.  You know, most Alaskans I know have quite a good sense of humor and are able to poke fun at themselves and at Alaska.  you ever notice the t-shirts that say the Alaskan State Bird is the Mosquito?  This sort of humor obviously has not rubbed off on you.<br><br><br><br>If you read the original post, you'll note that I cautioned people against flocking here...<br><br><br><br>"Starting to sound like a good place to live, no? Well, before you rush off to go panning for gold, keep in mind that winter lasts around 8 to 9 months of the year, so I hope you like winter sports."<br><br><br><br>Also, I'd mention that despite the high cost of living, in some ways, Alaska is still cheaper than California.  We have an over 8% sales tax and a 1000 sq ft condo (no yard) will cost you around $400,000.  Think about what kind of place you could live in Anchorage for that amount.<br><br><br><br></p>
