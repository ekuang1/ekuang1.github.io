message: <p>Well, Todd, Yes I am a Cheekako, just as you are.  I have lived here for years, and I have NEVER seen the Jack in The Box on Northern Lights and Minnesota!!  Been to that intersection plenty of times.  Hmmm.   Maybe you should go to this website and do a search on Jack in the Box, see what you find.  <a href="http://www.jackinthebox.com/locations/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.jackinthebox.com/locations/index.php">http://www.jackinthebox.com/locations/index.php</a>  And I live on the Airforce base on the very outskirts of Anchorage and drive to Diamond and Arctic which is the southern Outskirt of Anchorage in 15 mintues!!  In Rush hour!!  From Elmendorfs Boniface gate, to Norhtern lights, to Seward, to Diamond to Arctic.  The only two roads that are so congested it may take longer would be Tudor road and Glenn highway if you are stupid enough to get on them, or of course, unless you have no other choice.  So, I don't know how you drive.  Yes, there is a Walmart on Benson, I often spend every other Friday there shopping until Midnight.  It is the only place here open that late and I welcome a super Walmart, but doubt we will see it anytime soon!! Ther is also one on Diamond, one in Eagle River, one in wasilla and one in Fairbanks (just opened last year)  I have been to all of them.   Yes,  we do get the return on the oil profits...but let me ask you this.  Just as an example to simplify...if that money amounts to $5.00 total and there are 5 people to distribute it to, then each person gets $1.00 right?  So if one more person comes, and there are 6 people and $5.00 your saying each of those six people will still get $1.00?  Hmmm..funny how that works huh. That is why we all have to apply before they can tell us how much we will each get.  If it was as simple as you say, then why would they not be able to give us our divend amount until after they have calculated the number of people eligable to receive it.  And yes there are earthquakes every day in Alaska, we just don't feel them all.  As a matter of fact, we had 24 today, May 10th!!  They are just so deep that most of the time we don't feel them.  We have felt 3 so far this year.  Try out This official website.  <a href="http://www.aeic.alaska.edu/Seis/recenteqs/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.aeic.alaska.edu/Seis/recenteqs/">http://www.aeic.alaska.edu/Seis/recenteqs/</a>  .  No myths there.  I don't know what Alaska your living in!!  How long did you live here, or do you still?  Because I am just a little lost on where your finding your facts.  If your going to be informing people on alaska, you should give them correct information.  Don't you think?  And if your going to try to prove some one wrong, you really should do some research yourself.<br><br><br><br>Have a wonderful Day Todd and thanks for the wonderful info n the non existent Jack In The Box, sure wish that was true!!<br><br><br><br></p>
