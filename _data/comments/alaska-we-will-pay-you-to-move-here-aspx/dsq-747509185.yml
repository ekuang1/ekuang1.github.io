message: <p>This is the greatest thing I've seen all week. I had heard about the PFD, but I thought it was only for Alaskan Natives. I have been wanting to live up there for years but I too am concerned about finding a job and a place to live, as I'm not really interested in living in Juneau or Anchorage, but more like Fairbanks or ideally, somewhere even smaller in the Interior. I'm down for crazy weather, I live in the Colorado high country, which we like to think is somewhat comparable, although I'm sure it's nothing like AK. Does anyone have any experience on the just packing up and moving scenario? I would more than likely be in the crappy job market, so is it best to come to Anchorage first and then save up before you move further in, or are there opportunities in Fairbanks? I don't want to blow all my money on rent in the city if I could put it to better use in a smaller town, which is my goal. I would even live in a cabin with no plumbing or heating, as I live in a wood-heated cabin now and I have lived in houses with no water in the past. <br><br>I don't know anyone up there, so I would be taking a big leap, just me and my dog, and it's pretty scary, but in a good way.</p>
