message: "<p>Yep, the PFD (Permanent Fund Dividend) started out as about $300 a year some 20 years ago and now is hovering around the $1000 mark per person; it has gotten as high has $2000.<br><br><br><br>If you're from the Pac Northwest, like Washington or Oregon, you'll find Juneau's climate to be quite similar. Anchorage, the largest city of about 300,000 people, is in the tolerable South Central region. It does get cold there, but note that 1) It's not a humid cold, 2) It typically gets colder in the Great Lakes area of the Lower 48 due to the wind chill factor. Fairbanks, smack dab in the middle of Alaska, is tougher to live in - it has extreme cold in the winter and extreme heat and mosqitos in the summer.<br><br><br><br>Other good and smaller towns to check out for living: Homer, Valdez, Bethel, Soldonta, Haines.<br><br><br><br>As mentioned above, no sales tax, no state income tax. Cost of living is similar to larger cities on the West Coast. Jobs are there, but will only really start to increase a lot if ANWR happens. Alaska is for people that love the outdoors.
