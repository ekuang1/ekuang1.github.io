message: <p>I've lived in Alaska for over 30 years and the only two who make any sense in this discussion are Larry (who is welcome up here any time) and Sativa. Both give sage advice and it would behoove anyone interested in moving up here to take their advice seriously or else you could become something much worse than a cheechako, which is a sourdough; SOURED ON ALASKA AND NOT ENOUGH DOUGH TO LEAVE. Our entire population, including Native Alaskans, is a little over 600,000 and there's a reason for that. <br><br><br><br>Incidentally, our marijuana laws aren't nearly as liberal you think.<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?wtm_view=&amp;Group_ID=4522" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?wtm_view=&amp;Group_ID=4522">http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?wtm_view=&amp;Group_ID=4522</a><br><br></p>
