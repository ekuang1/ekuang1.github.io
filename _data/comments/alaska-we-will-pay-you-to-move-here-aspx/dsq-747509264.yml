message: <p>I have lived in Alaska for 29 years of my life I'm 36, was born in Sitka, little town where fishing and lumber were the only industry, I come from 3rd generation Alaska's that Moved here from Nebraska during the Great depression in the 20's, when I was a kid in the 70's my mother used to recieve state checks for every child she had, wasn't much $100 but that was a decent sum in the 70's, the government has always tried to offset some of the extra expenses of living in The Land of the Midnight Sun, <br>As far as the oil goes, I always understood it as we (Alaskans) don't own the oil but we own the Land it comes from and the State and various Native Corps have leased it to the Oil companys and that is where we all get the Money to invest in the stock market which in turn creates revunue for the State, the native corporations and the PFD fund.<br>As far as the Weed goes, its expensive, barely legal but well tolerated and of some of the finest varieties in the world.<br>As far as moving here goes, if you're a good person, have some morals, hard working, like snow, like fish, please move up here,<br>If however you are small minded, bigoted, or just plain nasty then please stay away, we have enough people who have come up here already who are like that.</p>
