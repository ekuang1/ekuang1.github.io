message: <p>Wow. I am truly stunned. There always has to be one moron that ruins it for the rest of us, and unfortunately, Alaska is the same as all the other states in that matter. This Todd person sounds like one of the stereo-typical macho guys, who probably drinks way too much each night and knocks his wife around. <br>One thing I think any person should take into consideration when contemplating a move to Alaska, the crime rate here is pretty damn high. We also have some of the highest numbers of child abuse, both physically and sexually. And until very recently very little was done to punish those offenders. The residents of Alaska have sat silently by while children have suffered. I'm relieved that I am finally seeing somewhat of a change here. <br>Yes, the cost of living here is pretty high, but there are many states that are actually higher than we are. The no taxes thing is pretty nice, unless of course you plan to purchase a house. Then you pay out the rear! That's how our city repays most of it's bonds. <br>If you are a voter, you might be a bit disappointed in the voter turn-out, especially if you are like me and feel that too many people have lost sight in the fact that it is an honor to be able to vote in this country. Also, if you are a Democrat, you might feel a little lonely, as this a largely Republican state. <br>The dividend is nice, when you have either a large family or are single. It's definitely not something to rely upon however, especially if you go late on a student loan or some other major bill, because they can take you to court and garnish up to 80% of the PFD. Unless you live in a studio apartment, or efficiency as we call them up here, one PFD might pay one months rent. Or you can do like most people and spend it on Christmas shopping or that one major purchase that you've been looking forward to all year. <br>Sadly, Todd was wrong, the amount IS determined by how many eligible applicants there are any given year. So the more people that get approved for it, the less money there is to share amongst the people. And Alaska is seeing a boom in population. <br>The scenery is absolutely amazing, having lived here my entire life (so I'm definitely no Cheechako!) I have never grown tired of just looking around. The moose that run through the city streets, the bears that run through the neighborhoods, the foxes that I see sprinting through parking lots, it never grows old. I especially look forward to the bird migrations we see each spring and fall. There is never a shortage on things to do here, no matter what the season! In spring, or break-up, as we call it, I really enjoy the slush-cup events each year. The Iditarod is amazing, but unfortunately they have decided to end the Fur Rendevous, our wonderful "winter carnival" that has been a long standing winter tradition for a very long time! <br>Alaska has it's pros and cons, just like any other state in the U.S. Let me dispell a few rumors for you new comers though:<br>1) You do NOT need a passport to come to Alaska.<br>2) We do NOT have our own currency here.<br>3) No one lives in an igloo.<br>4) We do NOT use dog-sleds to get around!<br>5) We do not have snow year-round. That's just silly!<br>6) We actually DO have a pretty advanced school system, that I know first hand is actually a few grades ahead of at least a couple of states in the Lower 48.<br>Oh and one other thing, something that should be required to tell ALL visitors to Alaska, be nice to the Natives. This was their land until we took it. I'm not native myself, but I have several really good friends, and some of my "adopted" family here is native, and the treatmenat I see that they get is horrible sometimes! <br>Now that I've said my share, I pass the torch on!</p>
