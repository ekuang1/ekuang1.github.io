message: <p>Holy cow! I don't even live in Alaska but I can do simple math! Lisielove is exactly right about the PFD. About everything else, I have no idea. I live in Sarasota, Fl and am coming to Anchorage for vacation. I have news for the knuckleheads that want to live in Alaska so they can collect their dividends. If a lousy $1000 a year is a deciding factor in your move, you'll starve to death! My cousin was in the Air Foce there for 3 years and said the cost of living is higher than Sarasota. I'm pretty sure if you can't make it in the lower U.S., you won't make it there! That being said, I think I would love to live there,I just don't know if a native Florida boy could survive the first winter.</p>
