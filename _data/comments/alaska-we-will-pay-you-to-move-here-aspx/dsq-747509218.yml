message: <p>Yes, I did understand your jab.  And I do have a sense of humor, but when you talk of money...most people skip passed everything else.  I don't think that 1/2 of the people get the joke.  All they see is that Alaska pays you to live here.  And yes..you can certainly compare the climate here to somewhere like Minnesota or even Colorado.  And most people can live with that to get a little money!  It is exciting and adventurous.  AND they pay you...what deal...even if there is cold weather.  What you don't mention is the depression that a lot of people suffer because of the darkness and the cabin fever they get when it is too cold and too dark to go out.  But whats even worse than that...is being so far away from everyone on the outside.  It is like living on a remote island.  One road in, and one road out.  These people are looking for easy money and adventure.  They may find the adventure..but no easy money.  Anyway...I am sorry that I just didn't find the humor and I had to voice my opinion.  I am also sorry that Todd had to get so upset over that.  It has been interesting to say the least.  By the way...we just had an earthquake about 2 minutes ago...my chair was moving in circles.  Thats a pretty weird feeling.  =)</p>
