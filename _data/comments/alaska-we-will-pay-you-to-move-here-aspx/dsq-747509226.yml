message: <p>Wow, what a fantastic retort Larry Lar! I'm really feeling so embarrassed by the magical power of your pen. The sheer expression in your prose is as good (or "gooder" in Florida gibberish) as any Oprah book-of-the-month club best seller. I beg you, stop the assault of your powerful words on my weak and delicate frame! For you a truly a Shakespearian god and your words weighty on the soul.<br><br><br><br>Dumb ass.<br><br><br><br>You still prove that you can't think beyond fourth grade math. You and Lesi-love should have lunch together behind the big tree at school, kiss and learn your times table. You don't even understand inflation, let alone Internal Rate of Return. You probably have $10,000 (a WHOLE YEAR'S SALARY!) in credit card debt and your kids eat Mac 'n Cheese for din din while your family cheers in unison "this is good cheap eatin'!".<br><br><br><br>I invested $20.00 and made 100%, bringing it up to $40.00. I take $10.00 and give half to you and half to your ugly wife; you both now have $5.00 each. Now I take the $30.00 remaining and reinvest that. Next year, your disgusting baby is born. I've made 100% again, but this time on $30.00, bringing the total to $60.00. I decide, because your baby looks like a garbage can, to give each person only $3.00 this year. So I have $51.00 remaining, which I invest again. The year after, I got an 80% return, which brings it to $91.80. Your drunk one-legged uncle moved next door, so now I've got to support his sorry ass. I decide to give each of you $10.00 in the hopes that your in-bred family won't bother me again. I now have $51.80 left. Which I reinvest and the next year make 175% return on.<br><br><br><br>I now take the half the investment proceeds, buy a bazooka and blow you and your family to hell because you are so stupid and can't do basic math. I take another 25% of the investment proceeds and buy dirt to fill in your mucky Everglades so we can all pretend that Florida is not 87% swamp land. I then take the remaining 25% to reprint schoolbooks for dumb Florida school children that state that Florida was never swamp land and they should point all reference to swamps to Louisiana.</p>
