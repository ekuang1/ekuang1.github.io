message: <p>Please Help!!<br>Dose anybody know where to find info on getting help to move to Alaska.  We don't want to live off anybody for free, but just some funding to help us relocate and getting a place to live.  You see my husband and I have no money right now, being both unemployed (we were both laid off) and living with a Mother-in-law, two dogs and a cat in a small one bedroom condo in Orange County, California for the last 10 months - it's very stressfull.  Jobs out here are very competitive and so it makes it hard to get employed and live here since the average one bedroom apartment is $1,500 + and the average home is around $675,000 for an ok small 3 bedroom.  All we want is some help to get to AK and a place to live and settle in.  After that we will do the rest by getting employment and offering the best we can to give back to the community.  We don't need the best area, all we want right now is to get out there and settle in.<br>Thank You for your help and consideration.<br>Mike, Michelle and our Boxer dog- Malina.</p>
