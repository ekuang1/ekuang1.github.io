message: <p>Hey! I just realized how smart todd is (accidental or intentional lower case? You decide)!<br><br><br><br>Today, I found $20 blowing down the street. I picked it up and decided to split it with my friend (who is imaginary). Now we each have $10 (or a ripped 20 dollar bill, anyway). But then I remembered Todd's lesson to me and took back the $10 (now I have 20 again) and decided to call 8 more friends. Now there are 10 of us to split the $20 with. They thought we would each get $2, but thanks to Todd's help we each still got $10! Thanks Todd! You're the greatest financial advisor ever!      &lt;big hug&gt;<br><br><br><br>Now, if I were to slit their throats (thanks again, Todd!) and steal the money back, I'll have $100!  Only Todd can teach that kind of return on investment!<br><br><br><br>I am unclear on one thing, though. If any of them are ugly or drunk and one-legged, will that affect how much money we each get? Oh yeah! Of course not! I forgot about inflation and internal rate of return! Silly me.<br><br><br><br>The macaroni is on me tonight, baby!<br><br><br><br>Oh goody! I'm not bored anymore! I owe you so much!<br><br><br><br>Todd, I love you.  &lt;wiping the tears&gt;</p>
