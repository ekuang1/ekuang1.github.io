message: <p>I came across this little thread and had to throw my 2 cents in.  Mr.Todd, whoever you are, you have no clue about anything it seems.  There's many things I'd love to point out that are completely wrong, but I don't want to waste my time.<br>Alaska is a wonderful place to live. I personally live in Anchorage and its only winter about half the year, and the winters aren't THAT bad.  Very comparable to Minnesota/Wisconson winters.  And we do have Walmarts, Burger Kings, and most every other big brand that is in the rest of the country.<br>No, we don't get paid just to live here.  We get a dividend for our share of the PFD investment, just like a shareholder in a corporation would.<br>Yes, its legal to POSSESS pot in Alaska, up to 4 ounces in your own home.  They have tried several times to create laws to change this, but each time it has been declared unconsitutional.  It is still illegal under federal law, but rarely prosecuted.  Sale or distribution of any amount is also illegal.<br>All in all, Alaska is a great place to live, IF you're someone who likes the lifestyle Alaska has to offer. Harsh winters, beautiful summers, and all the salmon and mooseburgers you can eat!  If your only reason for moving here is for the PFD, then you are making a BIG mistake.<br>All that for 2 cents.  What a deal.  :P</p>
