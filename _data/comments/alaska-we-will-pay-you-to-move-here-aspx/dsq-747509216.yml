message: <p>First of all Todd, you can't even spell my name.  Second of all, A Cheechako is A newcomer to Alaska, what in the west would have been call a "greenhorn."  However, the natives here consider all of us "outsiders" Cheechako's.  Did you check out those links hun?  You should. The facts are in them in plain English.  The Earthquakes are so far down in the earth that we don't feel them, but there is a chance for us to get a bad a earthquake that is felt on the surface.  It has happened. But, thats not really what this is about is it?  It's about you not wanting to be proven wrong. I didn't mean to piss you off so badly.  Would it make you feel better if I just told you that your right even if your not?  I didn't realize it would send you into a frenzy.  Not my intentions for sure.  The whole rain thing in AZ..that was interesting. I am sorry I am not welcome in Alaska.  This is the first I have heard of that!  =)   And for who ever said this was suppose to be humor, I don't see humor in misleading people.  You get money living here, but it in no way shape or form even begins to put a dent in what you spend to live here. People believe this stuff, and they want to cash in.  Truth be, Alaska is WONDERFUL.  I plan to be here for the rest of my life.  It is breathtaking and Awe inspiring.  But it is expensive, far away from home, expensive to travel, expensive to live, and winter is harsh.  If you can live with all that, and don't expect the PFD to be some GREAT thing and that your gonna be raking in the cash just because you get paid to live here...then come on.  The mountains are beautiful, the towns are few and far between and the wildlife is abundant.  But it isn't for pansies.  Telling people that they get paid to live here....I do not find humor in. If anyone wants real information on Alaska, I would be very happy to provide you with the information you want.</p>
