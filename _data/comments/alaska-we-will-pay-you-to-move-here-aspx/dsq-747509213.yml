message: <p>Lesi-love,<br><br>Listen, you still don't have a clue what you're talking about. You're just a Cheechako - by calling me a Cheechako, it's clear you don't even know what it means. Were you born in AK?<br><br><br><br>If you drive from the Base to Dimond in 15 minutes, you know you are actually breaking the law because you are driving 70 MPH through stop lights? Are you killing pedestrians along the way?<br><br><br><br>Earthquakes every day? You know, it rains every single day in Arizona? It's just in the external atmosphere, so they don't feel it on the ground. What the hell kind of statement is that - we have earthquakes every day but we just don't feel them??? More importantly, if you don't feel them, who cares? Do you know that is 600 degrees every day in Alaska too? It's just that it's at the ozone layer, so we don't feel it.<br><br><br><br>I think you need to go do some basic economics course. You mean uncle George Bushy isn't paying for this for you during your military service? The oil revenue is invested in a variety of invesments, mutual funds and others. If these go up, the over all money available is more, regardless of the number of applicants. Then it is divided by those that apply. If it was $1,000,000,000 last year with 500,000 applicants, you will still get more money if it is $2,000,000,000 this year with 600,000 applicants. Your sad-ass math tells me you may not even know how to do basic addition and multiplication. I'm afraid if I started talking about Internal Rate of Return you'd choke to death.<br><br><br><br>Lesi-love, please shut the hell up. You're not welcome in Alaska anymore. Go somewhere else.</p>
