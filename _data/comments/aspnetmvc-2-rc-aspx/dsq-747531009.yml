message: <p>Lots of bugfixes - the release notes mention 3 of them.  Bug fix rate must be slowing with holidays.  :-)<br>Release notes say you CANNOT have VS2010 beta installed!  Ugh.<br>What about the source for MVC and futures?  Codeplex was not updated.<br>Thanks for the update though!<br><br></p>
