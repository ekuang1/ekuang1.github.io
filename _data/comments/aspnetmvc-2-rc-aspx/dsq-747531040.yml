message: <p>What is now broken is the JSON metadata generated is treating &lt;input type="checkbox" /&gt; as required because the *Database Column* is a not-nullable [bit] column.<br>So, for all CheckBox input controls with a not-nullable Boolean property, we cannot submit the FORM unless we check the CheckBox.</p>
