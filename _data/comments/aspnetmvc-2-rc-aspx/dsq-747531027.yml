message: <p>I agree with Richard Kimber. I can't help but feel like Microsoft is forgetting about the people getting their VS2010 groove on. I know you guys are busy, but please please please get us an update for VS2010 or help us understand how we can update our current VS2010 projects to use the new goodness.</p>
