message: <p>Oh, this is so sweet. Now if I could just get one of my customers to start a new web project. Most things seems to be "brownfield" or (for me) WCF. <br>Please keep up the work on IronRuby + ASP.NET MVC, I seriously think it will be quite popular give it some time and PR :) What might be needed is some more work on the M in MVC, something that plugs in with ASP.NET MVC somehow?</p>
