message: <p>@Haddy<br>I agree with Adam, ViewData actually would be a perfect name. But you are right, MVC3 and inparticular Razor is amazing. Well done Haack!<br>@Adam<br>I don't think there are any inbuilt ViewData extension methods. There are plenty of examples on the internet where people have made custom extensions. Say if you had an extension method that creates a select list.<br>e.g.<br>Html.DropDownList("FooId", ViewData.BuildSelectList("Stuff"));<br>You cannot make dynamic extension methods. If you use strongly typed view-models, you'll never come across this. But you could always push the method into the view data (seperate the concern by putting this population in a different place.)<br>@Haacked<br>The big selling point for me about MVC (and I know this goes for alot developers) is that MVC is tidy. For that we have alot to be greatful to you for. Webforms seem overtop and cluttered with a number of features that do the same thing. Please keep MVC tidy.<br>I vote for onward and upward. I agree with Adam, it's not the only breaking change we've had the endure. I do also agree with Haddy, well done, you've put together some excellent work.</p>
