message: <p>I hear a lot of complaining... and very little appriciation. Thans Phil, and the rest of the <a href="http://Asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Asp.net">Asp.net</a> MVC team for making this happen and putting the time and resources forward to continue to expand the project. <a href="http://Asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Asp.net">Asp.net</a> MVC, I feel, is the best thing to happen to .NET for a while. I love it, and I don't think I'll ever go back to webforms for any of my own projects.<br>As far as the naming... no name is perfect, nor can they please everyone. Viewbag... eh, might be considered slander in some states lol... but anyways, good luck finding a name everyone agrees on.</p>
