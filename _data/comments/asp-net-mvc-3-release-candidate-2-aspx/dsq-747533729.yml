message: "<p>Hey! Im working on a slightly big project and part of it is a web app.<br>I decided to go with mvc and got the books I started playing with mvc2. I seriously LOVE razor, just the look of it, haven't downloaded MVC3 yet.<br>My question: Would it be safe to use mvc3 RC2 for my project? I dont want to use mvc2 then upgrade, but I will have to make a iterative release on Jan 1 for my project. Will the RTM come by then? Also, Im assuming going from RC2 to RTM won't really be a problem!?</p>"
