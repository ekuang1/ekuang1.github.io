message: <p>As far as we can tell, the signing errors are occuring on Windows XP or Windows 2003 boxes due to a potential bug with the certificate authorities on those boxes. This is not a NuGet bug as far as we can tell. For example, most people were able to upgrade just fine.<br>If you download our VSIX from 1.3 and 1.4 and compare them, you'll see that the signatures are correct.</p>
