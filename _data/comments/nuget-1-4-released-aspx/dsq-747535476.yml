message: <p>One major thing that NuGet does not have is fully supporting source control. I think NuGet should automatically add all packages to solution folder name “packages”. So when we change/update package, project source control will automatically update source file too.<br>Currently, I need to manually update all file in packages folder to source control.<br></p>
