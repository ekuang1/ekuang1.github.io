message: <p>See, that's why I have two blogs. Although <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jeff/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://weblogs.asp.net/jeff/">my tech/.NET/Microsoft blog</a> tends to be neglected since I work on something I can't generally talk about, I do every once in awhile post something that is specific to the audience. My <a href="http://jeffputz.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://jeffputz.com/">personal blog</a>, on the other hand, has no theme, no tags, just whatever I feel like writing about. I noticed your full-name domain name is owned by a lawyer. Boo!</p>
