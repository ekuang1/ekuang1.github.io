message: <p>It may be that the client doesn't know what they want, but drawing pictures of screens and reports is a lot cheaper than building something and throwing it away.  I just built a small database application from scratch and my key document was an ER diagram which I scratched out after a phone conversation with the client.  Getting the data structure right is one of the few absolute requirements for a successful application.  I still suspect that Agile is loved by people who like to play on computers without regard to the cost to the customer.</p>
