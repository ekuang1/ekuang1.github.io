message: <p>I agree his doc is fairly tight and borders on Agile. Outside of certain technology decisions (e.g. VNC, type of SQL database, etc.), implementation is pretty much left to the development team.<br><br><br><br>Also as one who used to be in "big corporate development" I remeber requirments templates that were 45 pages long. That does not include any docments required for technical exceptions, test scripts, etc. (all stored as doc templates.) Also each various documents had comittees that would review your project all before development could begin... (and don't get me started on SOX and HIPAA compliance audits...)<br><br><br><br>So yeah, Joel really doesn't understand BDUF.<br><br><br><br>Oh well... as mentioned in the other thread, a lot of times he's right, but when he's wrong, he is way off base.</p>
