message: "<p>In the interest of full disclosure, I'd like to announce immediately that when it comes to software, hardware, and the production, understanding, and - I'll be honest - competent usage thereof, I'm just about one notch above Ned Ludd.<br><br><br><br>What I really wanted to applaud was your carefully liberal sensibilities:<br><br><br><br> &lt;blockquote&gt; \"a client often doesn't know what she wants until she sees it.\" &lt;/blockquote&gt;<br><br><br><br>And then I got to thinking...maybe that's actually a bit backhanded, in its own innocent way, loosely equating a female client with indecisiveness and lack of forethought.  And then I figured I'd give you the benefit of the doubt, 'cause I've been reading this here weblog for a considerable length of time, and you seem like a stand-up fellow.<br><br><br><br>And while I'm opining on things about which I have nearly zero domain knowledge and appreciably less experience, I'd like to say that I tend to agree with you re: agile design methodologies.  And while I don't know Old Boy personally, I've read enough of his writing to say that, to my mind, Joel just likes to write with conviction, irrespective of the matter at hand.  He probably has strong opinions about light butter/no butter/movie theater butter on his heat-expanded maize kernels, and he could probably write a persuasive as hell argument for his position and the more suggestable among us would immediately agree and get on their knees to show their appreciation for Joel's relieving them of their obligation to think for themselves.  Its admirable, really, but, yeah, sometimes he's totally off-base.  In this particular case, I think that Joel is just not being articulate enough in his thoughts concerning the distinction between BDUF and Agile Design.  The very name \"agile design\" implies design.  Its not that he's wrong, exactly, its that he's writing checks he can't cache.<br><br><br><br>I'll be here 'till Thursday, tip your waitress.</p>"
