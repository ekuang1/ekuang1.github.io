message: <p>Melissa, thanks for giving me the benefit of the doubt.  Having gone to a very liberal college, I unfortunately have acquired grave insecurities about using masculine/feminine pronouns.  <br><br><br><br>So I try to switch them up, rather than use the singular/plural mismatch of they/their, which though some say is now acceptable, I can't bring myself to do it intentionally.<br><br><br><br>I'm going to start inventing my own gender neutral pronouns.<br><br><br><br>I in no way intended to equate female clients with indecisiveness.  ALL clients, regardless of gender, age, sexual preference, hair color, musical tastes, are indecisive.  And I don't mean this in a negative way.  It's impossible for them to visualize exactly what they want in all its minute detail.</p>
