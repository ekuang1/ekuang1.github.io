message: <p>I like this, but I have a question.  What about the cases when an async void is valid?  I want to setup the unit tests as you have shown, but I think I'm going to have cases where I can't change to async Task.  I'm thinking I could maintain a white-list in the unit test of approved usages.  Is there a better way?</p>
