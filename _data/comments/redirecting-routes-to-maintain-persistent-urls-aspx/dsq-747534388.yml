message: <p>Very nice indeed Phil. Just wanted to let you know that since I took the leap-of-faith dive into ASP.NET MVC I have learned so much from your blog, and this one on redirecting to maintain persistent route is, well in my opinion it's sheer genius.<br>I'll definitely be downloading the source for RouteMagic. I suppose RouteMagic is compiled to work with MVC 3 isn't it? If so would you mind if I made some changes to make it work with MVC 2. I'm kind of stuck working primarily with MVC 2 (Client didn't want his application built with technologies that were in 'beta', no matter who the author/company is).<br>Kudos to you and all you give back to the .NET world, it's people like you who will ensure the .NET Community stays fresh, up-to-date and ever growing, in the right routes.</p>
