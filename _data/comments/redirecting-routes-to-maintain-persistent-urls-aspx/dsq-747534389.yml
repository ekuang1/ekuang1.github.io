message: <p>Sorry Phil, one more question please. Since there are many of us who are in the early stages of getting a firm grasp on MVC, would it be possible for you to write a series on MVC 2, something like from beginning to intermediate then intermediate to advanced.<br>Covering such topics and data binding (and complex binding), ViewModels versus Models, IoC utilizing StructureMap (that's the IoC container I prefer actually). And maybe topics on using the generic repository pattern coupled with the unit of work pattern (or other n-tier styles, even something like the Specification pattern (I have implementation of all 3 but would like to see your views on them)<br>I know the writing you do takes a lot of work, and I could completely understand if you wanted to decline, especially with MVC 3 and Razor Engine being so popular so fast. So no hard feelings (none and I mean it)if it's nothing something that interests you (or you just have so much on your plate and aren't sure you could finish what you started. But remember one thing, I'd be more than willing to help out and I'm sure I could fine at least 1 or 2 more to help as well.<br>Let me know richard(dot)mccutchen(at)psychocoder(dot) net. I look forward to hearing from you ;)<br>Thanks,<br>Richard :)<br><a href="http://blog.psychocoder.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blog.psychocoder.net">http://blog.psychocoder.net</a></p>
