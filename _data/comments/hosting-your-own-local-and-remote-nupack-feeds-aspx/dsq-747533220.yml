message: <p>Nice post, very helpful. I saw <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/michelotti/archive/2010/11/10/create-a-full-local-nuget-repository-with-powershell.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://geekswithblogs.net/michelotti/archive/2010/11/10/create-a-full-local-nuget-repository-with-powershell.aspx">another post</a> by Steve Michelotti refering to how to download the packages to your local repository, I think that is a nice complement to this one.</p>
