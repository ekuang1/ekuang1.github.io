message: <p>GUILTY!!<br><br><br><br>At work, I often have a gun at the back of my head to get something completed. I miss deadlines occasionally due to trying to make something architecturally perfect. <br><br><br><br>Looking back on my ASP days, it's hard to accept that what I did was correct. Architecturally, it sucked, but it got the job done and in time. If a function is supposed to take in 2 integers and return the sum, it doesn't matter how it's done so long as the return value is correct. You can refactor it later after the deadline has passed.</p>
