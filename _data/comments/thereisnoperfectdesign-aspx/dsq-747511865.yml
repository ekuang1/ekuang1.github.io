message: <p>Hi<br>I wanted to comment on something Ken said, which is similar to what my take on this is:<br>'Although, I do think that the requirement of working at a acceptable speed with quality has caused me (over time mind you) to produce better code than I sometimes would if I spent many days working on a single component as opposed to hours. I do think every once in a while people overthink solutions in the pursuit of "perfection".'<br>My experience is that some of the best *improvement* of your development you will ever do is when you do have an undefined period of time (eg. your free time) in which to plan/code/design. I think this is particularly true from an architectural point of view, as you need time to see the bigger picture and see how it could best be implemented.<br>For everybody, to some degree or another, I think it's necessary to be able to take time with things in order to really understand them. That way, you won't have to rethink a problem when you see it again in a different context -- and when time pressure is indeed very great.</p>
