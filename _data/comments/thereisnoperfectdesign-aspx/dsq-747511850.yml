message: <p>I can totally agree, it is often very difficult to accept the fact that you have to create a balance between "perfect" design and getting a project done.<br><br><br><br>There are many times here at my job that I would love to be able and spend extra days on producing the perfect object model and database design to support that model, but the time just doesn't exist.<br><br><br><br>Although, I do think that the requirement of working at a acceptable speed with quality has caused me (over time mind you) to produce better code than I sometimes would if I spent many days working on a single component as opposed to hours.  I do think every once in a while people overthink solutions in the pursuit of "perfection".  Great Post, thanks for a good blog.</p>
