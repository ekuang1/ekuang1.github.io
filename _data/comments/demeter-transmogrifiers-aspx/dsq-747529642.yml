message: <p>This is the kind of discussion that gives huge amounts of ammunition to the anti-OOP folks, and the kind of discussion that makes languages like Ruby and Python very attractive.<br>At the end of the day, one can focus on all sorts of OO wonkishness, or one can focus on getting the job done. The OO dynamic languages like Ruby and Python really follow the Smalltalk school of thought when it comes to OO architecture, in that the *actions* matter more than the *architecture*. This kind of discussion is clerarly in the C++/Java/C# realm, in which the architecture is much more important to folks than the actions in performs.<br>At the end of the day, I "get" why these kinds of conversations are important, but at the same time, I wish they weren't needed. C# 3 is the first time VB.NET or C# appealled to me at all, and a lot of that is because things like extension methods, lambdas, and LINQ allow me to focus on getting the job done, and spend less time worrying about the architecture. C# 3 was the first time since I was a hardcore Perl user that I actually felt child-like curiosity and enjoyment in the "art of programming". Something about Java, SQL, VBA, and VB.NET (the languages I've primarily dealth with since I left Perl) just feel like total psychic energy vampires to me, if that makes any sense.<br>J.Ja</p>
