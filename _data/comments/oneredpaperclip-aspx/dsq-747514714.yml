message: <p>This isn't actually too different from working at a traditional job for a living.  For example, people trade all kinds of things for cash every day (including their time) and then trade that cash for a house.  This is an example of a barter economy that cuts out the cash.  <br>This guy isn't actually trading a paperclip for a house, he is identifiying value in a series of exchanges, which again, isn't too different from what most people do each day.</p>
