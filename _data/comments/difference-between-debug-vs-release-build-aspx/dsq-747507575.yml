message: <p>During the execution of <a href="http://vb.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="vb.net">vb.net</a> program if any error produces then in debug version when we try to correct this error then large amount of data is added up into this program to interact with debugger. this large data increases the size of assembly as well as the speed of the program execution become slower.<br>while in release version such large amount of data is not added up into that program. so in this mode the program can run fastly as stand alone program</p>
