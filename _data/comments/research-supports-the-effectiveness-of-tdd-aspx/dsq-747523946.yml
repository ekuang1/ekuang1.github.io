message: <p>Scientifically speaking, hypothesis and theory are VERY different.  A hypothesis is just a guess, usually used as a point of departure for experimentation.  A hypothesis only becomes a theory when experimentation proves it out.  Hypotheses do not have to be backed up by any evidence; theories MUST be.</p>
