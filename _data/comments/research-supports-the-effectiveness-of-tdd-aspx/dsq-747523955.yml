message: '<p>At University of Karlsruhe (Germany) there was an experiment that compared the way professional software developers apply TDD to the way students do. The full report can be found here: <br><a href="http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de/Tichy/uploads/publikationen/136/MuellerHoefer2007.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de/Tichy/uploads/publikationen/136/MuellerHoefer2007.pdf">http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de/Ti...</a><br>The results show quite clearly that students (despite having been trained in using TDD and claiming to have applied this process strictly) in general have a completely different way of TDD. This does not say anything about TDD being effective or not. But it is quite obvious that you cannot generalize results from academic experiments to the "real world".</p>'
