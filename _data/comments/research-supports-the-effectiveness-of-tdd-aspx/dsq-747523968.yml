message: <p>@Jacob When you wrote that post, it put a trackback in my comments, "TDD is proven, or is it" which creates a direct link between that statement and my blog post. I thought this would lead people to think you're saying I'm making this claim.<br>However, it occurs to me now based on your comment that you may have been referring to the study itself as claiming TDD is proven. Either way, it doesn't matter. I still think that's a strawman argument. ;) But I also don't think you did it in bad faith and I apologize for characterizing it as such. Your analysis of the study was illuminating and certainly opened my eyes to some facts I glossed over. Confirmation bias indeed!<br>One question for you, I can understand if you don't feel that TDD is a practice that might provide you (or your team) personal benefit. But setting aside TDD, what are your thoughts on having developers writing automated unit tests iteratively throughout the development cycle? Can you see <em>how</em> that might be a good process?<br>It seems to me it's hard to argue against the benefit of even giving that a try because the side-effect is so valuable. Especially when you try to change code later on that is called by code you didn't write. Perhaps not every shop experiences the pain of dealing with large brittle code bases as I've had. ;)</p>
