Doing TDD without a comparison test gives no confidence that it is more effective or no different than some other technique - it might be less effective.<br><br>Haacked wrote </p><blockquote>\"The authors do cite several other studies (future reading material, woohoo!) that for the most part support the benefits of TDD.\"</blockquote><p><br>If you haven't read them [future reading material] how do you know that they do in fact support the benefits of TDD?<br><br>Look at the 2007 <a href=\"http://maximilien.org/publications/papers/2007/Sanchez+Williams+Maximilien07.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://maximilien.org/publications/papers/2007/Sanchez+Williams+Maximilien07.pdf\">\"A Longitudinal Study of the Use of a Test-Driven Development Practice in Industry\"</a> and you might be surprised to see it's not really about TDD, it's about developer testing.
