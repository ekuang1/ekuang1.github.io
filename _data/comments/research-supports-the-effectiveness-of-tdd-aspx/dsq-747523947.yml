message: "<p>@John: I wholeheartedly agree. Anyone who sat down and actually looked through the linked PDF would've seen the flaw in their study, and I think Phil Haack should've perhaps mentioned the fuzzy details about it...<br>I wonder how big each story actually was. Were the stories already pretty broken down? They don't really say. The only thing it really mentions was what the task was (section 3.5, page 6), and that it was separated into several 'small' tasks. I suppose that means that they're already broken down? But that's not very definitive... Wish we could see all the stories and make the call for ourselves.<br>I think that yes, it should have been more of a control and allowed the Test-Last developers to break down their stories even more as well, but it would've been a much larger straw man if they had, say, made the  Test-Last devs code the entire project THEN make tests... Or if their stories were more or less something like, \"Implement a search engine.\" or something :) From the task size, though, I think they really were pretty small.<br></p>"
