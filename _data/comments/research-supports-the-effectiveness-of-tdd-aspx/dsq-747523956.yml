message: <p>Phil,<br>I have great respect for you.  BUT I think there is a great quote from Jacob's response that sort of gets cast aside in the discussion:<br>"Having a big clump in that upper left quadrant is troubling enough but then having the "Test Last" group almost double your "Test First" group in the over 90% quality range is something that should be noticed and highlighted."<br>I haven't done the analysis on the article.  But I have read both your analyses and I have come to a conclusion.  It's the same one that both of you come to.  More tests = better quality.  <br>But to extrapolate that conclusion to say that TDD is more effective seems a little dubious to me which is what both the authors of the study and you have asserted.  The problem for me is that the "quality" product was actually produced by the "Test Last" team.  Like Jacob I would have liked to have seen a third group in here... one that didn't use any automated testing tools at all.<br>Also, the fact that the experience level of the programmers is not revealed anywhere also puts the value of the study in question.  It says grad students which could mean people who learned to program in the last 5 years or people who have programming professionally for 10 years, or people who started programming as a hobby 15 years ago (all of which would have a slightly different skill set).<br>I have said for years and I'll say it here.  It's the Man/Woman not the method that brings success in the programming field.<br>Jay</p>
