message: <blockquote>I realize now that I haven't communicated the message much. I now strongly agree that this particular study is not conclusive (I said it all along actually). However, I think it would be nice to look at the other studies this study references.</blockquote><p><br>I agree that you were pretty careful to keep your language in line with what you saw in the study. You <em>didn't</em> say the study proves anything, merely "support". But then, while I never said you made claims of proof it's the conclusion you jumped to based on the title of my post and its conjunction to what you did say.<br>In other words, you jumped to a conclusion about what I said just as many others jumped to a conclusion about what you've been saying. Frankly, both leaps aren't terribly unreasonable based on how things were laid out. You're a TDD fan so it's easy to make assumptions about why you are linking the article. I'm a TDD skeptic so it's easy to make assumptions about why I'm linking to your post. Neither one of us did so in bad faith, I don't think, and depicting it as such is a disservice to the discussion.<br></p><blockquote>My goal is not that pointing to these studies suddenly convinces people that TDD or Automated Unit Testing is effective, but that it convinces people it's worth giving it a try for themselves rather than dismissing it outright. Capiche? :)</blockquote><p><br>I never dismiss things outright. But this study didn't make me want to try out TDD, either. Personally, I tend not to try things out until I understand <em>how</em> they're supposed to be better than my current processes. For me, TDD hasn't made that case yet.<br>I'm not ruling it out. I'm not denying that others have had good results using TDD. I'm not even saying that my way is for sure better. All I'm saying is that the case hasn't been made well enough that I want to spend the resources to give it a fair shot. It's a pretty intrusive change to how I do things now. That gives it a pretty high hurdle to clear.</p>
