message: <p>I would agree with the original author's use of the term synergistic, especially when referring to the part about reducing rework.  When things work together better than they do separately, it is *indeed* synergistic.  So, the way those effects all combine to improve productivity is the very thing that businesses so want--increased overall productivity.</p>
