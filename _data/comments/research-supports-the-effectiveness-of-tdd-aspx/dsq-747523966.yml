message: <blockquote>afaict you have become convinced about TDD without "a massive amount of solid evidence" but now you would require "a massive amount of solid evidence" to become unconvinced.<br>You may be "a fan of the scientific method" but in this case you don't seem to be following "the scientific method" :-)</blockquote><p><br>@Isaac I'm also a big fan of engineering. When you try something and it works for you repeatedly, you don't need to know the science behind it to know that it works. <br>For example, for centuries people have been able to brew beer while having no freaking clue what was really going on. They also realized that drinking beer made them feel better than drinking the polluted water. They didn't need science to tell them that beer contains alcohol which kills microbes to suddenly gain the benefit.<br>And if science came along and said that brewing beer is impossible and isn't fun to drink, I'm sorry, but it would take overwhelming evidence to make all those happy drunks think twice. ;)<br>In this case, writing automated unit tests is an engineering practice that has proven itself effective to me. It's worked for me time and time again. Thus if the science came out and said it's not effective, it would take a lot of evidence to make that claim to me. It's quite possible that research might refine our understanding of why it is effective, or that it is something else that is actually effective.<br>For example, I've assumed that TDD is effective. But this study seems to point to writing automated unit tests is the actual source of benefit. Fine. It just may be that I don't have to write tests first to gain the benefit. However I personally find it's a great way to help me focus on a problem. <br>Like the way an athlete does visualization exercises before a game (which is demonstrated scientifically to be effective by the way).</p>
