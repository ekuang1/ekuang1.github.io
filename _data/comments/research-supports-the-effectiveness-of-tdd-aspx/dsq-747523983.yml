message: "<p>\"So while Iâ€™m personally convinced of the benefits of TDD and feel the evidence thus far supports that, I do agree that the evidence is not yet overwhelming. More research is required.\"<br>Indeed. One word which covers it is: 'context'. As you're inside MS walls, do you see the large(r) teams around you use TDD to develop their work? Why not? <br>Btw, it's good that TDD is researched if it is effective and if so, when and how, what can be improved, and what makes it really effective? <br>Especially that last part is essential and this isn't dug up by this research: if two truly equal teams start a series of different projects, one using their own homegrown method, the other pure TDD, which group produces in all cases the best results? To me it's still unclear. <br>I'm still convinced that simply the best professionals create the best stuff, regardless what kind of methodology they use, because if you suck in software, your software will suck, no XP/TDD/Agile can help you make it better (and for the record: neither waterfall or other methodology).<br>What I find a little disturbing though is that reading the comments here, some people jump to the conclusion that it is now proven that TDD assures better productivity/better quality etc. <br></p>"
