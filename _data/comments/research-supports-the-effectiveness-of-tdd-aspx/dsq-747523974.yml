message: <p>There's still love here for you... Sorry if I jumped into fight... I guess I spent too much time in that environment on another blog site.<br>We are in ABSOLUTE agreement that automated testing tools really CAN increase the quality of a project...<br>The concern was just that some would read this and think "aha... TDD is proven effect.  Why won't those dummies do it?"  <br>As always we're cool (that is if you're still cool with me)... sorry if I came on strong.  I have a new blog community and I didn't want to see one my co-bloggers get beat up...<br>Jay Kimble</p>
