message: <p>@Keith Well to be fair, I did mention some of the fuzzy details. I point out that quality was actually correllated with the number of tests written, and not necessarily whether it was TDD.<br>While we're on the topic of "Straw Men" I like how Jacob's post changes my point to "TDD Proven Effective!" and then sets the lighter to that straw-man. I point out that this merely adds evidence.<br>Social experimentation is a tough business. All they've really proven is that a group of undergrads in a controlled experiment exhibit certain quality levels. However, until there are many experiments that provide evidence to the contrary, this still does provide experimental evidence towards something many developers experience day to day.<br>The paper also cites multiple other studies which are worth reading that support the TDD claims. So the question is, if you've never really given it a try, but you've heard lots of anecdotal evidence from other devs in favor of it, and research papers are starting to come out in support of it, on what basis are you denying that TDD is effective?</p>
