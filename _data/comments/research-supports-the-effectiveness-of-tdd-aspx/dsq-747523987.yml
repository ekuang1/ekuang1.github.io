message: <blockquote>I'm still convinced that simply the best professionals create the best stuff, regardless what kind of methodology they use...</blockquote><p><br>Well that goes without saying, right Frans? ;) <br>I think of it like the book, the <em>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>. I'm sure there are truly effective people who don't exhibit all of these habits. Perhaps even the rare few who don't have any of these habits. But I bet overall, the habits are quite common among highly effective people.<br>However, I bet that even a very effective person could be even <em>more</em> effective by adopting these habits if they haven't done so already.<br>So the question becomes, is writing automated unit tests (separate from TDD) a habit that can help good developers become even better? I think there's strong evidence for that, but again, more research is needed.<br>The next question is whether <em>TDD</em> specifically is a habit that can help effective developers become even more effective? It's worked for me and I strongly believe it can work for others in general, but I think the evidence is less conclusive.<br>It may well be that for me personally, TDD is a habit that instills the discipline I lacked before. In that case, it greatly improved my software development skills. It's quite possible there may be devs who naturally have that discipline and TDD would not provide that much benefit. My intuition is that the number of devs in that camp is very small.<br>Frans, you are probably in that camp, so perhaps you don't see the benefit of TDD because it wouldn't benefit you (just guessing there). However it may well benefit a great majority of developers simply for the reason that it's a habit that <a href="http://www.lazycoder.com/weblog/index.php/archives/2007/08/08/the-number-one-trait-a-successful-developer-needs/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Developer needs discipline">requires</a> discipline. Kind of like how it's easier to do a long run when wearing headphones playing music with a good beat. TDD provides that beat for me.</p>
