message: <p>@Jay <br></p><blockquote>But to extrapolate that conclusion to say that TDD is more effective seems a little dubious to me.</blockquote><p><br>I never said this study demonstrated TDD was *more* effective. Just that it was effective. You are correct that I probably could have downplayed the results more. To me, the results show that automated testing might be the effective part of TDD. But even that could be disputed because there's no control group doing zero testing.<br></p><blockquote>It's the Man/Woman not the method that brings success in the programming field.</blockquote><p><br>I agree with that, but I think of it like the 7 Habits of Effective People. You don't need to do those habits to be effective. But they are common among effective people. I think automated unit testing is a habit that can make even effective people *more* effective.<br>For me, it's like the whole placing the keys in the same place. Even smart people misplace keys. But if you adopt good habits, you make those mistakes less.<br>I realize now that I haven't communicated the message much. I now strongly agree that this particular study is not conclusive (I said it all along actually). However, I think it would be nice to look at the other studies this study references.<br>My goal is not that pointing to these studies suddenly convinces people that TDD or Automated Unit Testing is effective, but that it convinces people it's worth giving it a try for themselves rather than dismissing it outright. Capiche? :)</p>
