message: <p>A lot of the former TDD pundits are now emphasizing BDD and DDD as being the next logical step in the Agile progression.  I wonder when we'll see more research in this realm.<br>It seems ironic that Agile development is one area where the industry seems to be driving innovation much more so than academia.<br></p>
