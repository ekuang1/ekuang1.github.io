message: <p>Anyone interested in commenting on why they think America should stop emitting world and environment destructive gas or why it's become a catch 22 for obvious U.S. economic reasons ? Where are the people behind this policy ? What are the rest of the people going to do about it, assuming they don't agree with destroying the world ?<br>Mich√®le</p>
