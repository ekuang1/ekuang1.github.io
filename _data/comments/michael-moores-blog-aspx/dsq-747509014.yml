message: <p>Sorry to say I'm totally disgusted with American policy. I've lived in the States and worked there and came back to Europe convinced that the U.S. was on the wrong track way back to the Bobby Kennedy days. I hoped to be proven wrong... but the spirit of prudishness and entire lack of knowledge about the rest of the world which I had discovered then has proved to be correct.... There is no democracy without freedom... a frase I had thought was what America was all about. It's sad to see and what is even worse are the results of bigotism, false patriotism and a sense of being right whatever... whether this involves a world war or not.<br>How utterly desolate the position appears... Unfortunately, the U.S. is a world power but is using it for the wrong purposes.<br>Kyoto is still uppermost in my mind.<br>Best regards,<br>Mich√®le</p>
