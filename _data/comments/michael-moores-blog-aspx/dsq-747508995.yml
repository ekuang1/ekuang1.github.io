message: <p>Dear Mr. Moore,<br>After watching your interview with Jay Leno this past Tuesday night, I wanted to ask whether you honestly believe that that the four 9/11 rescue workers that you brought to Cuba actually received the same medical care that the average Cuban citizen does?   <br>You lauded the Cuban health care system by stating to Jay Leno that Ms. Reggie Cervantes had snuck out of the hospital without the cameras and came back into the hospital to see if she would receive the same careâ€¦and she did. Therefore, you said that the care she received must have been representative of what every Cuban not only has access to, but also receives.  <br>However, anyone who speaks Spanish can tell that not only is Ms. Cervantes clearly not a native Spanish speaker (she even stated her birthday in an incorrect form when she was being admitted), but that she certainly does not speak with a Cuban accent.   Given that - not to mention the fact that none of you were wearing clothes that the average, impoverished Cuban wears - would have definitely clued the Cuban hospital personnel that she was a foreigner and, therefore, should receive superior care. <br>If you are interested in learning the real truth about the Cuban health care system or life under a dictator, you should interview Cubans on the Island who have lived without basic human rights which they are entitled to by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
