message: <p>Maybe Michael Moore is a little Left...but I feel...as far as healthcare and this country...he is right on target!!!  I am a registered nurse (now a caregiver for my Mom) and I worked in nursing for over 10 years.  (Also, retired military...but that is another story!) It not only caused me to question my choices of an idealistic profession but it totally sickened me!  Nurse to patient ratio's were usually off and patient care suffered greatly!  I saw diabetic patients who had tried to care for wounds beause they could not afford to come into the emergency room and ended up in the hospital with really horrible staph infections and the possibility of amputation.  I have seen the homeless abused and imprisoned because a town didn't want them on their streets.  I have watched the problem of homelessness and wondered how we let this problem escalate!  As a nurse and a patient, I have seen medical malpractice on a scale that is outrageous for a country that is supposedly so advanced!  I feel  if anything, the movie under exagerated the healthcare system in the United States.  I would have included the atrocities that occur in nursing homes...and please...don't forget the over priced dental care...which the middle class and poor can barely afford.  I have suffered at the hands of incompetent healthcare providers...and watched (helplessly) when my Father slowly died (and starved to death) with lung cancer which had metastisized...and now am taking care of a Mother with dementia and all of the incompetent lwayers, bankers, psychiatrists, doctors, nurses and dentists.  Medications not prescribed properly...lab values not monitored, dental work that was subpar resulting in improper fitting dentures (end result-no dentures)...over medication  Oh, I also delivered a baby in this country and what a bloody joke that was...the nurse forgot to start my PCA pump (yes, my pain pump!)...you can imagine the rest of the story..oh...the same nurse left me in a pool of amniotic fluid for an overextended amount of time!!  Oh yeah, they did not catch the fact that my baby was jaundice...I pointed it out to a sleeping nurse!  This is healthcare in one of the richest countries in the world?  We have turned into a country of shameless incomopetence and mediocrity!<br></p>
