message: <p>Hello Phil,<br>It's difficult to say what I need to communicate in a few words. I'll give it a shot. My name is Chaz Myers. I noticed two specific points of interest about you that caught my eye. First, you are obviously the proud father of a bright eyed child. Secondly, you mentioned that you are fanatical about soccer. I have a gift for both you and your child. With your help, I have faith that we can provide it to the entire world. <br>I created an revolutionary new sport called Sircle Soccer. Its been played at the high school, middle school and college level in California.  Sircle Soccer is a sport of peace and unity. Played on a circular field within the geometric representation of what is known as "God's Ratio" the Golden Mean the mathematical ratio of perfection and Divinity called Phi. <br>At the center of this soccer universe is one goal which allows all players the chance to score a goal. I have taken the most popular sport in the world and put it the perfect shape. It is extremely high scoring. The rest is soccer.<br>Please don't take what I share here frivilously. I am extremely humbled by what I have been given. As you may agree, creation is an ongoing process and you may well have a hand in making this consciousness of peace through sport a reality for your childs future and that of the world. This should be sufficient to humble you as well. <br>I have some question that perhaps you can answer.<br>You were chosen. If those words make sense to you, please call me at (818) 706-1349 or email me at CHAZcreates@sbcglobal.net. Eager to speak with you. Chaz</p>
