message: <p>Dear Michael:<br>Please allow me to rebut some of your outspoken critics.  I wonder whether theyundersatnd your movies and oyur patriotism for America.  For them, America is about war mongering, imperialism, pre-emptive wars, insane gun violence, escalating insane healthcare costs, and anybody who speaks against such mammoth problems is unpatriotic.  I hope one day these people will learn.<br>I am not able to find a way to contact you.  I am inviting you to be a keynote speaker at the Sixth Annual INt'l Smart-sourcing conference to be held in Atlantic City, NJ on Sept. 6-7, 2007.  I Hope you will respond ASAP.  This year's conference is focusing on HEALTHCARE OUTSOURCING AND MEDICAL TOURISM.  With this option, millions of Americans can get cos-effective top quality healthcare in countries like India and Thailand.  One statistic is that one can get surgery in these countries for 1/5th cost in USA. And this low cost also includes 2 weeks of tourism, boarding and lodging.<br>I hope to hear from you soon.<br></p>
