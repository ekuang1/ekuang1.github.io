message: <p>FORGET SCOTT BROWN AND DO IT QUICKLY<br>Run the Health-Care Bill passed by the Senate through the House, and get on with a bill to create jobs. Pass Health-Care now, and get the jobs; and we can elect even more democrats in November. Don't be knocked off track by the do nothing devil damn republicans. You are a great salesman, Mr. President.No matter how good it is;it has to be sold.<br><br><br></p>
