message: <p>What is wrong with our Dem. party??? Can't seem to get it right.  Why do we continue to try to find things wrong with the Rep. party only to have it fly back in our face? <br>Who was found innocent of all charges????  Who approval ratings sky rocketed today????  When will we get the message.  Now is the time we need to focus on what the Rep.'s have so failed...Cut our spending, reduce taxes, control the war on immigation. Does this sound like a Rep.  or is it what the people want?  It is truly what thy want and what WE can win by.  Let us not get side tracked by our terrible Dem. leaders like Kerry, Kenn. and our failed leader of our broken and falling apart party...How. Dean.  What is wrong with us...will we just stand by while Bush's ratings continue to rise due to our stupid actions.  I say NO.  Let us foucus on what is important instead of trying to go after the Rep. party.  I feel an urgency for we are on track to loss more seats in the upcoming elections!</p>
