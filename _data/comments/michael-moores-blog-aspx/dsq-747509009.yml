message: <p>Michel moore is a geinus. But to work,Kaiser Permante has the slogan "thrive" its a lie! From the time of my experiance with Kaiser .It has been Hell. Recently I have discovered that Big K Materially Mis handles Medication . It is stored in warehouses not condusive to the safe handling of medication. Resulting in medication that is innefective,Dangerous,and it appears that they buy placiboes and fake medication to dispense to their Paying customers. This fraud becones clear when you find medications purched elsewhere are effictive,safe,and trustworthy.Worst of all in the name of corporate thrift the pharmist at bigK practices medicine. The mantra of the corp. Is." Its too soon". In the ordinary handling of pills some are droped,lost ect. You pay big bucks for the services of bigK Why not cheerful service.</p>
