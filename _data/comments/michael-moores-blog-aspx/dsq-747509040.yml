message: <p>March 3rd, 2010 10:53 pm ET<br>SENATOR JIM BUNNING IS THE EPITOME OF THE IGNORANCE<br>OF THE REPUBLICANS ABOUT THE NATIONAL DEBTâ€“ WHICH IS<br>THE BIGGEST FRAUD EVER PERPETRATED ON THE AMERICAN<br>PEOPLE. TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE<br>GOVERNMENT'S DEBT IS THE SAME AS THEIRS IS A<br>BIG LIE. ARTICLE 1, SECTION 8, OF THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE<br>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE POWER TO CREATE MONEY AND IT<br>DOES AND SHOULD. MONEY IS NOTHING MORE THAN<br>METAL, PAPER, AND MOSTLY BYTES ON A COMPUTER<br>CHIP. GOODS AND SERVICES IS WHAT HAS REAL VALUE.<br>TWENTY MILLION UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE COULD BE PRODUCING<br>EVEN MORE GOODS AND SERVICES IF WE WERE NOT HUNG UP<br>OVER A STUPID NATIONAL DEBT. IT IS A BIG SHAME THAT THE NEWS MEDIA AND THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARTICLE 1, SECTION 8, OF THE CONSTITUTION SAYS.<br>READ MORE AT THE INTERNETFREEPRESS.COM</p>
