message: "<p>CREATE JOBS, JOBS, JOBS BY SHARING THE WORK<br>Now is the time to cut the work week from 40 hours to 36 hours per week.If 90% of the work force can produce all the goods and services needed, it is time to reduce the number of hour per week worked by 10%. The work ought to be shared by all the people who want to work. Making a living for oneself or a family is the most important thing in life; it comes before God or Country. If one does not have the right to make a living, what good is any right? Instead of big businesses storing huge profits as just numbers on a computer chip,which is like putting money under a mattress, which doesn't create jobs by moving goods and services: the real wealth of a nation; they should share it with more workers, instead of milking more sweat out of fewer people. <br>Businesses should be required to pay time and one half for all hours worked over 36 hr. per week and double time for time worked over 40 hours per week. Why shouldn't businesses be required to help support a Reserve--Retraining Work Force? Instead of unemployed people drawing unemployment benefits, they would be paid to go back to school which would include<br>school cost and health insurance. Businesses and Governments would pay the cost. All the schools both private and public would be used.
