message: <p>Michael, I want to say I am a fan of yours and I am so grateful we have someone like you to tell it like it is.   The mess this country is in and listening to you on Larry King tonight and your forthright answers on how we can take our country back.  I wish everyone would listen to you.  I was so proud of you tonight. You have all the right answers. If only this country would listen. I want the country we had with FDR and TRuman and Kennedy. Right now this country is in the hands of a bunch of gangsters.  I could rant and rave and I do say the things you say, but nobody listens. We are small people and that is why I am so glad we have you to speak for the little guy who cannot be heard.  Thank you    Marty</p>
