message: <p>M. Moore,<br>Unlike you, I am proud to be an American.  This country has done tremendous things for the world in promoting domocracy and individual freedom.  Our children have gone to war to fight for your freedom.  Some of them died while fighting for you.  This country was formed by Judeo-Christian beliefs and principles.  Capitalism allowed this country to be strong enough to promote a more manageable world.  Capitalism also provided you with your wealth.  If you want to re-distribute your money then go for it.  If you prefer a better place to life then go for it, i.e., sociaism, communism.<br>However, you are an embarrassment to Michigan and the USA.<br>God loves you!<br>Duane   <br></p>
