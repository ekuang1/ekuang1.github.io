IS RIGHT MORE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT<br>Since the states gave up their right to create money, the Federal Government has the<br>responsibility to create the money the states need to balance their budgets. Article 1,<br>Section 8, of the Constitution gave the Federal Government power to create money.<br>Money must be created first before equal value can be created. The Federal Government<br>needs to create enough new money now to give each state five hundred million dollars for<br>each member of congress, which would be equal distribution. Goods and services is what<br>has real value–not money, which is mostly numbers on a computer chip. Over 5% growth<br>in GDP proves that money must be created before equal value can be created. The stimulas<br>and the bail-outs of banks and auto makers increased the GDP.<br>SOLUTIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S MONEY PROBLEMS<br>California could create its own money by making it good only in the state of<br>California and exchangeable with the dollar in California. Since the Federal Government<br>has a stupid money policy, there is no need for California to be broke when money is only<br>a medium of exchange for goods and services. California could withdraw from the United States<br>and become a new country. It could then create its own money supply like 191 other countries– which<br>would be good anywhere in the world. This would get the USA of the off of a gold standard mentality.<br>Article 1, Section 8, Constitution gives the Federal Government the power to keep a balanced money supply. New money<br>should be made available to all the states without any matching funds required for creating jobs and funding new<br>businesses which produces new jobs. Goods and services have real value. Money is only numbers on a computer chip<br>which exchanges goods and services.
