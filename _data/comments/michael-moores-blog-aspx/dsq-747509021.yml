message: <p>I just watched Sicko and could relate to so many things Michael brought up. My husband has been retired 7.5 years. Our retiree medical insurance has tripled since he retired. He is on both Medicare and United Healthcare and still we pay out hundreds of dollars every time he has any kind of medical treatment. Now EEOC has sued that companies no longer have to cover retirees medical insurance, which will leave me without any insurance until I turn 65 in three more years.  Our medication co-pays have also skyrocketed! Now with the price of food and fuel, we have even less to spend on necessities. <br>We are still looking for the golden years. <br></p>
