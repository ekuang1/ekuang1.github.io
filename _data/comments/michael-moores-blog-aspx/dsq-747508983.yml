message: <p>michael moore is a self indulgent and arrogant asshole. First, people don't elect the president. The electoral college does. The act of voting for the president is actually ridiculous because your vote doesn't matter. Whether you vote for someone or not doesn't matter the electoral college can vot how they want. Read the law its in there. so stop complaining about how gore was cheated and how he won the popular vote, it doesn't matter. Second, the majority of the troops that are downrage believe they are doing something good and believe they should stay until its won. And let me remind people that you may want the soldiers out of there but its not up to you. You aren't serving so stop trying to "help" the soldiers because you aren't you are demoralizing them and not supportive. I know I am a soldier. Third, how would micael have acted if we were attacked. would he have sat idly by? I think so. How can one who has never lead anything of importance critisize someone over something he has no knowledge of himself. Mr. Moore is an idiot and has blatantly lied on screen and edited scenes to fit his personal beliefs and views. If i would ever see mr moore in person i would slap him. He is un american and if he feels offended he should leave the US and go somewhere else we don' need him. His views are non american and he should be non american.</p>
