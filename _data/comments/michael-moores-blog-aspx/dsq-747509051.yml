message: "<p>AN IDEA FOR BP: WHY NOT USE A DEVICE DESIGNED LIKE A TOGGLE BOLT THAT CAN BE PUSHED<br>DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE AND THEN UNFOLD SO THE OIL PRESSURE WILL CLOSE<br>OFF THE HOLE? YOU CAN CHECK THE IDEA OUT WITH A WATER HOSE. YOU WILL NOT<br>NEEDED MUD OR PRESSURE OF ANY DEGREE TO INSERT IT INTO THE HOLE  AND PUSH<br>IT THROUGH THE  BOTTOM. YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RUPTURING<br>THE PIPE. PUT THE DEVICE ON A CABLE SO YOU CAN PULL IT BACK WHEN IT GOES<br>THROUGH THE HOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL. YOU CAN MAKE THE DIAMETER<br>UP TO 25 % OF THE HOLE SIZE AND AS LONG AS NEEDED TO COVER THE HOLE AFTER<br>IT UNFOLDS. SAW THE PIPE OFF AND DROP IT IN THE HOLE AND PULL IT BACK<br>WHEN IT UNFOLDS. IF YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL WORK, YOU CAN TRY IT OUT<br>.ON A LAND WELL. SIMPLE IS BETTER SOMETIMES. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT A<br>TOGGLE BOLT IS, TRY AN UMBRELLA DESIGN. 5/10/10</p>"
