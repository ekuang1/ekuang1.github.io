message: <p>Michael, a simple GST or VAT of 4 %  for the UNITED STATES would eliminate the entire deficit and allow all Americans earning less than $100,000 to pay no income tax.a GST  did not hurt the canadian economy while helping it substanially because it eliminated the deficit. A deficit is is the most damaging item one can throw at any economy while a tax increase can actually increase GDP. I know the Republicans (all without degrees in advanced Economics) think this is not correct.<br>Tony</p>
