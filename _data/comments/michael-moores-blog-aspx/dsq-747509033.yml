message: <p>TAX,TAX,TAX THE RICH AND GIVE TO THE POOR-- THE<br> POOR WILL SPEND IT AND THE RICH WILL GET IT BACK<br>By taxing the rich, it will get the money out from under the mattress and move the good and services so more goods and services can be produced.The rich stores their money as numbers on a computer chip which has the same effect as putting it under the mattress. Taxing the rich will create more jobs, and the rich<br>will get even richer.<br><br></p>
