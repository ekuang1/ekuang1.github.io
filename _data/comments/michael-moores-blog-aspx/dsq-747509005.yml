message: <p>Though I am an ultra-conservative right winger, I try to catch some liberal news too. Last night was a dream come true on Larry King.  Michael Moore debating with Dr. Gupta???  The irony to this he condemned a media that actually supports his ignorance.  The fact that Dr. Gupta called him out on his stats is HUGE!!!  I can attest from his very first escapade he called a movie that was filmed in Flint, MI this man is a bum.  He capitalizes on the uneducated, poverty stricken and ignorant.  Look at all his movies...then look at TEAM AMERICA world police....NOW that was funny, and he got what he deserved, lol.<br>ADVICE TO MM, GET LYPOSUCTION, A NOSE JOB, AND A LIFE!</p>
