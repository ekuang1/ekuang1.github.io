message: <p>Micheal moore is brilliant&gt;!!!!!!!!!!! what planet are you on?  Can you figure out he is so 1 sided that a 6yr old could figure that out...do you think that the average Cuban citizen can walk into that hospital for care?  guess again, it is Castros personal facility only for governement and family..you would not let your pet doggy stay in the real cuban hospitals- did you know that you have to bring your own pillow, sheets, blankets w/you to the hospital?  did you know that if the doctor needs antibiotics to treat you or any other medicine, that a family member -if you have 1 - has to go to the local pharmacy, pay cash, and bring your medicine back to the hospital for the doctor to give it to you...?  Yeah sounds great we should sign you and your family up for the next heart transplant there...get ALL THE FACTS BEFORE YOU SPEAK.</p>
