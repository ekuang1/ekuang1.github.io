message: <p>I served my country, was a nurse for over 20 years, and had 3 levels of voluntier work for the red cross.. Three years ago this nov my life was changed by going to a chiro.. I was rushed 911 after the third visit.. My L5 was crushed out with2 pieces blocking my nerve space 60%.. After the emergency surgery I was going to PT but after 6 visits they refused to see me because I complained that my neck and middle back hurt.. and the Rx only said to treat the Lumbar.. When I told my neuro he said I should see a shrink.  I soon lost my job and inc.. Last Jan, 2011 my room mate put me on his inc. and i just got surgury on my neck.. He had to remove 4 vetebre and 3 disc..Next he said my lower back needs to be fused.. Now what am I suppose to do.. People who have heared my story tell me to write a book but I need your help to put it together.. I have more stories of negelect and abuse that I have seen in my 20 years in health care or as I call it, Health Profit that you may be interested in.. Also as a female soldier in regards to "don't hear and don't save".. can you help me please... I live in ft. lauderdale, FL and feel like my life is over.. I feel so dumb.. I really thought that devoting my life to caring for others was what a person should do.. Now I just feel like a burdon... Even my ex husband would say I was the most devoteted and hard working person he ever knew.. Now i sometimes just want to die.. I hope you can find time to come speek with me.. Please, all i do is cry all the time.. I truely believe that you and you alone can help put things back into perspective for me... Everyone counts to make a country work.. not just the rich..</p>
