message: <p>I agree. I am working on a project right now and doing a little web surfing to decide on a naming convention. I think prefixing a table or sp with 'tbl' or 'sp' is silly. I understand what that's all about but it seems to me that kind of a rule is implimented by inexperienced or unknowledgable developers (probably someone half in the business world). I wouldn't say its bad, but unnecessary and bothersome. I don't embroider 'towel' on all of my towels...</p>
