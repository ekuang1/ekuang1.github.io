message: <p>I had a similar experience.  A year ago I received a demand letter from a law firm representing the City of Houston.  It stated that I was 12 months delinquent in paying a parking ticket and that I had 30 days to correct the situation.  This was the first I'd heard of the ticket.  They had the correct license plate, but the wrong make, model and color.  Also, my car was at my office some 600 miles from where it was supposedly ticketed.  It took three phone calls and two FedEx packages before they admited that a mistake had been made.</p>
