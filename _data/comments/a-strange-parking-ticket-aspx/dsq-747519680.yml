message: <p>I had the same experience in the UK, saying my car had been parked at position x (happened to be near my parents house) and that I could pay the bill direct, only I had a problem in that I was attending a party that day and couldn't have been driving or parked where it says I was. So I phoned them and they said they would produce the photographic evidence, which never came. <br>So ALWAYS check on parking tickets through the post. I can imagine how many people would just pay!</p>
