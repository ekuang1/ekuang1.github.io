message: <p>The same thing just happened to me...I just got a ticket in West Hollywood and I live in Palm Desert...3+ hours away.  I have record of emails I sent that same day from my home computer &amp; picking up my daughter from school....what should I do to prove I could not possibly have been in Los Angeles?  The true license number has an "S" I suspect, instead of a "5"....They also got the color wrong, grey instead of beige.   Is there a way to get a copy of the ticket?  Do they note the make AND model on the original ticket?</p>
