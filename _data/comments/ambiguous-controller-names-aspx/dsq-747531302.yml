message: <p>Today I noticed the controllerfactory and mvchandler do not allow to call a controller just "Controller". I could not find any reason for that. The controllerfactory can cache the right controllertype with string.empty. I think it's a good convention for simplicity to call controllers ...Controller, but I think the mvc framework should not enforce programmers to use a convention which has no technical reasons. I would really like to see the conventions that are not used by mvc to be removed.</p>
