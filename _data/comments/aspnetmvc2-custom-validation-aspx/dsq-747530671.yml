message: <p>Obviously, to illustrate the functionality, you need to pick a simplistic example.<br>However, my wishlist coincides with Andrei on this.  I'm more likely to find a scenario where rules are data driven or role based.  A salesrep might have a 2.99 minimum, where as a salesmanager would have a 2.49 minimum.  Likewise, in 2009 it might be 2.99 where as in 2010 it might be 3.49.</p>
