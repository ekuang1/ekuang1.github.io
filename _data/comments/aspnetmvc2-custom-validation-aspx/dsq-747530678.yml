message: <p>@Ali, thanks! I'll correct my post.<br>@Dan, you can customize the error messages by using the ErrorMessage property of the attribute. If you download the sample, you'll see I do that.<br>Or you can pull the error message from the resource file. Looks like I should write a follow-up that covers that.<br>@Justin I'll post a follow-up that covers that.<br>@Tomas, @Raj thanks for the feedback. Yes there's a bit of duplication here. It's certainly possible to just have the client call back to the server and we'll post an example of a remote validator soon. However, the point of client validation is often to serve as a fast "First line of defense". Having simple validation rules call back to the server kind of defeats that purpose, so I'd only do that for validation that absolutely requires the server to perform validation.<br>I know there are techniques out there for automatically converting IL or C# to JavaScript and you could try employing them. I don't think we're ready to try and incorporate that into the framework as I'm not sure about the fidelity of such translations. So for now, I don't see how to get around the duplication.<br>Often though, the validation logic on the client can be simpler than on the server since it truly is just a "first pass" validation designed to help the user and not meant to be the actual gatekeeper if that makes sense.</p>
