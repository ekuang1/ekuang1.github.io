message: <p>@Peter Does the downloadable solution I linked to not compile? Are you running ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta?<br>@Andrei, @Zachary, @Austin, @Evan Thanks for the suggestion. I'll describe that in my follow-up. <br>However, for the time being, note that the <code>IsValid</code> method of your validation attribute could dynamically get the min value by querying the database rather than using the attribute value. Nothing stopping it from doing that.</p>
