message: <p>What about IoC injection for attributes and Validators?<br>I'm seeing a terrible pattern with some MVC features. You guys are ignoring IoC for some things (like ModelBinderAttribute in v1).<br>Validators (especially) contain business logic and should be injectable without having to access a singleton IoC accessor.<br></p>
