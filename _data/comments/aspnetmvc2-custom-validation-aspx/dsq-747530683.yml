message: <p>Love it! thanks again for an awsome post. I learned a lot from this.. now I just need to incorporate it into my app. This is exactly what I was looking for.<br>as andrei ignat posted, i too would love to see how you can do dynamic validation..<br>as you posted "I know there are techniques out there for automatically converting IL or C# to JavaScript and you could try employing them."<br>Really? can you please point me to some, I would like to test them out and see how feasable they would be for simple validations like date/price ranges and maybe CC number algorithms.<br>Thanks again</p>
