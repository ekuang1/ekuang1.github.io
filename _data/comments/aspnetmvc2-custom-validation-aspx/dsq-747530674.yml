message: <p>This is related to the "workaround" for installing this beta on a computer with VS2010 Beta 2.  Instead of a complete install, is there an easy way to get hold of just the MVC beta DLLs and do a straight-up "browse to file" type of reference to them?  I understand that method wouldn't have any spiffy tooling, but at least we could play with the real code.  Some of us don't use the spiffy tooling anyway.  <br></p>
