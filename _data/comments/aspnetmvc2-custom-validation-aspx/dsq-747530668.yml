message: <p>When I looked at <a href="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/post/2009/09/18/A-RESTful-Wizard-Using-ASPNet-MVC-2e280a6-using-Data-Annotations.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/post/2009/09/18/A-RESTful-Wizard-Using-ASPNet-MVC-2e280a6-using-Data-Annotations.aspx">Creating a wizard using Data Annotations</a> one of the issues I had was that you didn't provide a way to validate an entire Model and populate the ModelState with errors... the TryUpdateModel method only checked for errors related to the variables being passed in with the request. This meant "cross screen" validation errors were not picked up and I had to resort to calling Validator.TryValidateObject, then manually adding errors to the ModelState using ModelState.AddModelError. However, this approach also had issues... it didn't deal with complex objects and the ValidatorResults returned by TryValidateObject don't indicate which attribute had caused the problem. <br>Could you consider a future override of TryUpdateModel that validated the entire object graph?</p>
