message: <p>wow the last 3 comments seemed to come directly from webhosting4life. :|<br>im about to go with them but im afraide they will turn out to be bad. im a newbie to hosting and i dont need to get tricked and then covered up by webhosting4life agents proweling the net.<br>maybe it is an excelent service..?? im going to have to do serious research based on negative comments rather than the positive ones.</p>
