message: <p>I have had horrible experience with webhost4life. Actually no one at the staff that reads the support tickets actually understands what I say. After hosting for 3 years there, the service quality has deteriorated (very slow loading speed) and I waste lots of time re-submitting information on tickets that i had already thoroughly explained. Our company is moving all sites for clients out of webhost4life and I am actively telling all my tech contacts to stay away from that company. It is inefficient, low quality, and in the end we end up paying more with our time and nerves than we save by cheaper hosting. Cheap is expensive!</p>
