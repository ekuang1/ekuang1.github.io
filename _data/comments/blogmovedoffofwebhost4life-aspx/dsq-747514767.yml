message: <p>If you want to pay a little more than for just simple hosting, dedicated servers are cheaper these days.  No limits to what ports you are using, how much bandwidth, or how much load you are causing on the server.  Its your server and you can do what you want with it, even resell web hosting to others.  As far as support and having the company set things up for you, find a company that does everything for you for free, such as at Hosted DB (<a href="http://www.hosteddb.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.hosteddb.com">www.hosteddb.com</a>) and others may change a small fee.  You can bug them all you want with questions or requests to set something up and not be charged extra.</p>
