message: <p>&gt; I just hammered out a long comment and hit the reset button accidentally<br>Is there EVER a good reason to have a "Reset" button? And right next to the "Comment" button?<br>Isn't that a bit like putting the seat ejector button next to the ignition key in your car? EXCITING TIMES!</p>
