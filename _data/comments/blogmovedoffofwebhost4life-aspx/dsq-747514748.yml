message: <blockquote>Plus, being a geek, it's fun.</blockquote><p>I couldn't agree more Robb. I too host my blog from my broadband connection (running on a measly PII w/512MB of RAM I might add). <br>Yeah, I don't have 99.9999% availability like most of your major hosting providers do, but I estimate that I have upwards of 99.5%. And like Robb, having a very small reader-base I'm sure that I don't generate nearly enough traffic to come close to hitting my up-stream limits.<br>But to me the most compelling reason to host from home is that I get to learn/tinker with the whole set-up from the server hardware, OS, application server, database server, etc... Now I know that many people are concerned with backup &amp; failover and all of that, but being a small-time site I don't really need the failover. I do however have a pretty sweet backup solution in place -- using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> I have a nightly job that runs <a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/">rsync</a> b/t my server and workstation, and then rsync+<a href="http://www.openssh.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.openssh.com/">SSH</a> over the 'net to an offsite PC at a friends.<br>I've been meaning to write up a How-To for getting Cygwin + rsync + SSH all up and running on Windows, but just haven't gotten around to it yet. Perhaps it's time.</p>
