message: <p>Tripped over this post again(i subscribe via rss) after reading something about WH4L on Matt Berther's Blog.<br>So funny seeing exactly the same (positive and negative) comments posted from EXACTLY the same people - skim the comments at <a href="http://www.mattberther.com/2004/12/30/webhost4life/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.mattberther.com/2004/12/30/webhost4life/">www.mattberther.com/2004/12/30/webhost4life/</a> and <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/Lance/archive/2005/07/30/Webhost4life_Has_Terrible_Service.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://geekswithblogs.net/Lance/archive/2005/07/30/Webhost4life_Has_Terrible_Service.aspx">geekswithblogs.net/.../...as_Terrible_Service.aspx</a> as well as the ones here and you'll see what I mean.<br>@Masud and SJH - you guys are clowns, copy paste comments across different sites in the same sphere of influence within the blogoshphere - you two have to be marketing types, no-one else could be that stupid.<br>To anyone else thinking about WH4L - ignore the comments read the posts - those are the real impressions of the guys who used the service not some made up marketing hype.<br>WebHost4Life - sounds more like WebHost2Death to me.</p>
