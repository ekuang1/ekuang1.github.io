message: <p>I also have over 3 years experience with WH4L. It does appear that their level of service has degraded over the past year or so. After some not-so-scientific testing, I believe that the problem lies on their database servers (which I guess can be expected when they offer 2 free SQL, mySQL &amp; SQL express database to each customer). They recently (2/19/08) sent a message that they would no longer be supporting SQL Express after March 19th, so maybe service will improve in the near future. Here's the text of the message they sent:<br>"After extensive research and monitoring, it has been determined that the resource used by SQL express engine causes a dramatic performance decrease for the server.  Futhermore, it creates security issues for the server.  Unfortunately, we are forced to discontinue support for SQL Express database engine on March 19, 2008. For all customers using SQL Express engine, please move your database to a SQL 2005 environment. The easiest way is to use "attach" function through the "control panel -&gt; database -&gt; mssql admin" section to attach your .mdf and .ldf file. If you need further assistance, please feel free to contact our help desk support staff. Thank you."<br>I'll be sticking around a little longer to see if things improve (fingers crossed), but if they do not, I guess I too will be in the market for a new hosting provider...</p>
