message: <p>I've been with webhost4life since 2004, and I've been impressed with the storage space, features, and responsiveness of the helpdesk staff.<br>Lately however (last year or so), I've noticed a significant decrease in the speed - to the point where I'm considering relocating.<br>*sigh* the search for hosts is a pain in the ass.</p>
