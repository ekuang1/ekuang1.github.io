message: <p>While I don't generate enough traffic to give a dial up connection a hard time, I still host everything at home. Road Runner allows port 80 and I've got 10 down 2 up which is enough for a single blog that's not too heavy on the graphics (plus my phone).<br>When I get Verizon Fios, I'll have to pay for business class to allow port 80, but I still consider it cheaper than having to pay for hosting.<br>Plus, being a geek, it's fun.</p>
