message: <p>Quickbooks online crashed again. This entire day we cannot access any of our accounting data. No billing, no shipping!! They ran a security test and crashed the system. Who in their right mind runs this in the middle of the work week when companies depend on this to run thier business! We have no back up data so id Intuit loses the data we are just out of luck. And in the middle of this crisis their support has gone home for the night.</p>
