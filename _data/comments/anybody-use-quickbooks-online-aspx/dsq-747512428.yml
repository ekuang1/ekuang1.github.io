message: <p>We have used it for a few years now and it is very frustrating.  It locks transaction type for anything similar to a previous transaction.  I loaned my business money very early on, by wiring funds to the corporate bank account.  From then on ANY incoming wire is set as a wire from me to the company.  I am able to change the internal account from which the funds come from but as 99% of all the wires we get now are from customers, I am unable to select customers, only internal accounts.  QBO does this across all transaction types.  The recommendations are usually worthless.  Overall not impressed and we pay $400 per year for it.  <br>I would suggest you find a different option.</p>
