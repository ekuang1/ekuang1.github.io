message: <p>Quickbooks online horrible. Stay away from this product.  The basic version (Essentials) is useless for any practical purposes.  A simple entry for a client can't be done on the Essentials version.  You have to upgrade to the Plus version for 50% more in monthly price.  This is just plain awful and it is done to squeeze every penny from the customers.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.</p>
