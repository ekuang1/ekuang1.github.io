message: <p>I use both a Mac and a PC for my daily business. The biggest downside to Quickbooks online has been that it will only run on Firefox. However, I just read a blog post from July 2008 that said Intuit is working on removing ActiveX from Quickbooks Online which will make the system accessible with Firefox and Safari.<br>Other than that, the service has been great. I was previously using Quickbooks Simple Start as a local installation but this is much easier now that my employees can post their time and all of the data is central. I use a service called Minute7 to allow others to post their time and expenses.<br>-J</p>
