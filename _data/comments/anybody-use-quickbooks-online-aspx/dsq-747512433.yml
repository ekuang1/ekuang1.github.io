message: <p>If you need something to manage your products &amp; pricing, as well as Purchase Orders and Invoices - I'd check out <a href="http://www.rocware.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.rocware.com">http://www.rocware.com</a>.  They have really responsive customer service.<br>It’s a SaaS platform ($50/month) that manages the items you buy &amp; sell.  It's completely integrated with POs and Invoices.  When you input your items you are able to assign customized, private pricing - then share the product catalogs individually with customers.<br>Your customers can then create &amp; send POs based directly on your product catalog.  This is nice because:<br>1. It’s easier for your customers to place order with you (vs PDF sales sheets &amp; POs attached to emails)<br>2. it’s easier for you to receive orders because you know the POs will always come through with the correct product &amp; pricing info.</p>
