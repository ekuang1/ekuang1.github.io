message: <p>Just started using it for a new company we setup.  I thought it would be a fabulous solution to operate in a cloud with our corporate resources spread out over quite some distance.  The ability to simply access the books over the internet seemed ideal.<br>I hope I have not made a HUGE mistake but in the last couple days I have been down more than up.  This scares the hell out of me as we are a seasonal business (currently in the off season).  If this were to occur during peak - I would be screwed.<br>I have read so many blogs that indicate there are chronic and unresolved issues with support and product stability for quite some time I believe I should "cut and run" now before I get too deep in this mess. <br>I am still in my trial period so I have a few weeks left for that.<br>Sooo disappointed in Intuit here.  How do you bring a product to market with so little committment to support and overall stability?<br></p>
