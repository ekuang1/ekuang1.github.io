message: <p>I have been using Quickbooks Online as a remote bookkeeper and accountant for the past 9 months, I have 5 clients and all five use 1 of the four versions. It appears that a significant amount of the issues begin complained about here have been resolved. I've used all four online versions provided and had no issues. Some complaints I am hearing here actually sound more like a lack of knowledge on using the program as much as functional trouble, such as transaction designation and auto recall function trouble. I work with nothing but small business and I highly recommend this product to my clients. The complaint about downloading to send to your accountant shouldn't even be there as you can invite your accountant to view your file even with a 1 user version. I and my clients have been very happy with the functionality and usefulness - I will say that the more simple products offered are not for any significantly sized businesses, but for small business functions it works beautifully. <br><a href="https://www.odesk.com/users/~~c7ad837ba6c0ec0f" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.odesk.com/users/~~c7ad837ba6c0ec0f">https://www.odesk.com/users/~~c7ad837ba6c0ec0f</a><br></p>
