message: <p>DON'T DO IT!<br>We are on Macs and we were surprised to learn that it doesn't work in FireFox - you HAVE to use IE.  So we have to start Parallels, run XP, start IE, log in, save our changes, and shut down Parallels just to do an invoice.  IT'S TERRIBLE!<br>On top of that, we just tried to do an export of our data, and it won't let us because we don't have QuickBooks installed in XP under Parallels - it won't even let us bypass that to download the file so we can send it to our accountant.  Total BS.<br>Still waiting to hear back from tech support.<br>DON'T USE QUICKBOOKS ONLINE!!!</p>
