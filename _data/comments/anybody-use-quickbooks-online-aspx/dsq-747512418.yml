message: <p>I am a CPA who tried to use QBOE as the engine for all my clients.  It was the biggest mistake of my life.  I am no wailing because I have decided to convert all of my clients back to regular QuickBooks.  It is costing me a fortune to do this.<br>Their technical service is horrifically awful.  Their engineers go home at 5PM no matter how great the problem is.  And don't even think of getting any service over a weekend.  I had one technical problem with one client's file that took it down for over a week.  They didn't even care.  After hearing from a very angry client that didn't care what my technical problems were, that was it for me.  I'm converting back and cancelling all my subscriptions.<br>I feel comfortable leaving my email address.  Go ahead and ask me questions.  I'll be glad to share my nightmare with you.  james.andersenjr@gmail.com</p>
