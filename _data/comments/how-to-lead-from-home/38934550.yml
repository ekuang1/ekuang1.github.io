message: "Excellent points, I am borrowing the \"everything should have a URL\" concept. \r\n\r\nI've been working fully remote for over 5 years, with most of my team but a few being remote. I'd like to share the idea of having the dev team create their own space to talk about things like tech debt, to share knowledge, and to just catch up with each other in a group meeting format, we use Zoom for that. My team and I have been doing it for a while and it is a very enjoyable time where we can make decisions about tech debt, share our concerns, tech tips, discoveries, and vent out as well. Â "
