message: "Fantastic write-up. One thing leaders often take for granted is they are \"communicating\". Often, that's in a closed-door meeting to only a few people, so while they communicate with those present, they're missing out on the opportunity to connect with everyone else. \r\n\r\nTo your point of \"Everything should have a URL\", one of the most effective leadership communications has been blogs. Depending on the communication, I do believe it's very useful to drive alignment and engagement.  "
