message: <p>Would be great if you guys could display a date next to the tutorials and videos on <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.asp.net/mvc">www.asp.net/mvc</a> so people know which ones are the newest. I see the "NEW" icon but it's kind of ambiguous - a date would clear it up nicely.</p>
