message: <p>Hi Phil, <br>Great News shared.<br>I am dying to work with IronRuby and Asp.Net MVC since ages, but no good news are seen nearby. <br>Can you kindly make it clear for once and all that should i leave all the hopes to work with IronRuby and Asp.Net MVC or i can still keep on dreaming with this.<br>No news are bad news.. and thats really frustrating.<br>Thanks</p>
