message: <p>VERY VERY relieved here to see that jQuery 1.3.1 was NOT included in this version. <br>Theres a critical bug in 1.3.1 that I found -- the reporting of which I outsourced via stackoverflow.<br>In short $(function() { alert('Ready'); } does NOT execute when the DOM is loaded (as it should), but only executes when all images on the page are complete. This is an IE only issue which will lead to some pretty lousy responsiveness and probable race conditions from applications that have lots of images.<br>You'll want to at very least wait for a fix for this issue - and make a very thorough 'due diligence' decision as to whether or not to move to 1.3.x for RTM. I'm not sure what the jQuery community's overall reception has been of this release - but surprisingly they still have it posted as the recent version.<br>Here's more details including a link to the jQuery bug tracker and a test page for the bug:<br><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477463/jquery-is-waiting-for-images-to-load-before-executing-document-ready" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477463/jquery-is-waiting-for-images-to-load-before-executing-document-ready">stackoverflow.com/.../jquery-is-waiting-for-ima...</a><br></p>
