message: <p>awesome work. first time i've EVER been excited reading release notes. i recommend anybody that hasn't to read them. and its not that i've been waiting for features for months - i started MVC 6 days ago. its just testament to the skill of your team and attention to detail for complex issues. i find myself saying 'wow thats great' far more than usual.<br>First impressions:<br>I don't like the new method 'File' in Mvc.Controller. It conflicts with System.IO.File name, and is confusing becasue one is a class and the other is a method. I'm sure theres a better name for it that really describes what it does. 'File' is not very discoverable or a good indication of what it does.<br>Its great that 'Add View' doesn't ALWAYS add a codebehind file anymore. But how about an checkbox in the 'Add view' dialog to create one if I need it. I often like to write helpers to create my view. I understand exactly why it was removed (and originally why it was needed) but I want it back! PLEASE!!! I couldn't immediately see an easy way to add a codebehind file after the fact (apart from shift dragging a different file and then manually adding the correct inherits attribute - yuk).<br>Html.ValidationMessage(string modelName) has a slightly confusing name (the modelName parameter). How about changing the parameter name to 'modelPropertyName or 'propertyName' or 'fieldName'. When I first saw 'modelName' I'm thinking 'what! they want the name of my model class???' <br></p>
