message: <p>I'm having an issue with Ajax.BeginForm after upgrading a MVC Beta site to a RC1 site.  <br>&lt;% using (Ajax.BeginForm("Contact", "Home", new AjaxOptions { UpdateTargetId = "contact_modal", OnSuccess = "registerEvents", LoadingElementId = "contact_ajaxicon" }))<br>   { %&gt;<br>The form using this tag works on the first ajax submission, but not on the second - using the mvc ajax debug file, I've confirmed that it's getting a 404 error - the first time it's correctly pointing to "Home/Contact", but on the second it points to just "Contact".  This was working perfectly (and on many forms like this one) in the Beta version.<br>My eyes are glazing over looking at this - any ideas?<br>Thanks!</p>
