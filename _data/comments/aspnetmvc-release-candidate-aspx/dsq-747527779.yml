message: <p>Hey Phil,<br>Another bug I've found is the change to the helpers with regards to generating urls.<br>I must be the only person who actually still uses <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> web controls within my views (I bind data from my Model to controls via Page_Load) <br>Now I have a massive problem because the Url.Action / Url.Content methods return relative paths (they include ../ etc into pages, abd web control hyperlinks like to embed the path to the current view to the url as well, so now I get controls with a NavigateUrl of say /Views/Home/../Home/About, and the runtime shits itself about using .. in paths<br>Does no one else use the asp:HyperLink control anymore?<br>I can post a very succinct example of the failure:<br><a href="http://www.arcturus.com.au/mvc/Index.aspx.txt" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.arcturus.com.au/mvc/Index.aspx.txt">http://www.arcturus.com.au/mvc/Index.aspx.txt</a><br>gives an example of it appending the path to the view + the url to the action<br>For the time being I'm using ResolveUrl rather than Url.Action</p>
