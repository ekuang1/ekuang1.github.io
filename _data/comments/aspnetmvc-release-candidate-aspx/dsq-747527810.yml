message: <p>Hey Phil, I love the new RC1.<br>Question:<br>I separate my controllers out into their own assembly.  <br>This renders some of the cool features, apparently unusable for me.<br>Is there a way to tell the project where my controllers are so I can take advantage of the new features (like goto controller)</p>
