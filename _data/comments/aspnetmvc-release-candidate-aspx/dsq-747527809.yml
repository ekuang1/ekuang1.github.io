message: <p>Phil - I started this thread here, which you answered - I realized after I posted here that I probably shouldn't have used your blog post for a support forum.<br><a href="http://forums.asp.net/p/1376650/2898567.aspx#2898567" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://forums.asp.net/p/1376650/2898567.aspx#2898567">forums.asp.net/p/1376650/2898567.aspx#2898567</a><br>Essentially I rolled back to Beta for now - if there's a good workaround that you would recommend in the meantime (there's one on the forum thread linked to above, but I haven't tried it yet), I'll do that and wait for the full release in a month or so.<br>Thanks again!</p>
