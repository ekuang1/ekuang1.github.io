message: <p>About the US date format, I live here and logically, the rest of the world is right. Although why the rest of the English speaking world spells color wrong is beyond me. ;)<br>BTW, does anybody have any localization tool recommendations? I'm considering springing for a copy of Lingobit Localizer for a project I'm working on, but wanted to know if anybody knew of cheaper / better alternatives?</p>
