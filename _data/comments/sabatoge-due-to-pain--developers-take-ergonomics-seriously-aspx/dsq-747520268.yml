message: <p>@Don - Because I don't use the DataHand. I have nothing against it, I just like the GoldTouch keyboard. It works for me. However their research is quite good and quoteworthy, don't you think? :)<br>@Ogre - I did briefly cover this, but should have said more:<br></p><blockquote><br>But no amount of macho posturing changes the fact that some people, for better or worse, are more prone to these type of injuries than others.</blockquote><p><br>The converse is true. I've known developers who were positively Neanderthal in their posture, jabbed at the keys like a Jackhammer, and held the mouse with a kung-fu grip, yet had no problems.<br>While I know of other devs who do everything right, and still have pain.<br>It's not necessarily that you're doing something right, or that those with pain are doing something wrong. Some people are just more prone to it.<br>For example, I can run miles and miles with blisters on my feet without much complaint. Whereas I know others who run 10 yards and collapse from the intense pain of a tiny blister.<br>Just luck of the draw I guess.</p>
