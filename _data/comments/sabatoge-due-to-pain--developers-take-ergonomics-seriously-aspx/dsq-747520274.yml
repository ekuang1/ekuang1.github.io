message: <p>I went to look at the Steelcase Leap chair tonight.  I'm sold.  I'm going back to buy one tomorrow.<br>This was at Target Commercial Interiors in Bloomington, Minnesota.  $625, out the door in black.  Other colors had to order, but the same price.<br>That's nearly $200 less than I found at any online stores.  It's interesting to see a mass merchandiser like Target get into office furniture.</p>
