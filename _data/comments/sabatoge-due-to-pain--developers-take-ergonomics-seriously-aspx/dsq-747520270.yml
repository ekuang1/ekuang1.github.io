message: <p>Phil one other thing to consider is external activity. Not taking away from those inclined to have these symptoms, but moving hands, arms and getting blood flow through them on a regular basis probably has something to do with this as well.<br>I often code for 12 hours straight with no issues, but it's not always been this way. A number of years back I remember very frequently having wrist and hand pain at the end of a day but at the time I was somewhat less active. <br>One thing that has helped me immensely ( I think - can't really be sure, but ever since I started the symptoms are gone completely ) is Yoga which includes various poses that deal with blood flow to the lower arms. Nothing extensive, but I think just hte general practice of getting blood moving through the body and especially into the extremities can help tremendously to avoid repetitive motion injuries.<br>Just a thought.<br></p>
