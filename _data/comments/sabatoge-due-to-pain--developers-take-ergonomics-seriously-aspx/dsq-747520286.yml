message: "<p>Phil,<br>Thanks for the post. I developed RSI after a death-march project 5 years ago and have been fighting it ever since. Most of my pain comes from using my mouse, and I even learned to mouse left-handed (insert Princess Bride reference here). Posture, a good chair, ice, therapy and 5 different pointing devices still haven't made cured me.<br>My advice from my doctor was straight out of a Marx Brothers movie: <br>Patient: \"Doctor, it hurts when I do that!\" <br>Doctor: \"Then don't do that!\"<br>So I basically quit tying to do anything about it, and just sucked it up. Then, I recently got a massage, and she was astounded in how little circulation I had in my arm. Now I'm worried about arthritis and am renewing my quest for a pain-free coding existence.<br>I may end up with SmartNAV's hands-free mouse. It ain't cheap, but the plus-side is I'll probably end up looking like a Borg. <br>Oh yeah, thanks for all your work on Subsonic, too. Less work, less typing, all good.</p>"
