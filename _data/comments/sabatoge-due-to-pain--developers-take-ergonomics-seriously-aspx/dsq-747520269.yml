message: <p>"Am I a mutant? Did I start coding so long ago by body adapted before it was finished developing? Or maybe I'm just able to relax better durning downtime?"<br>Well, I'm about 6'4" in a world made for 5'9" men. Most of my pain comes from having to use the mouse at an odd upward angle with my wrist resting against the edge of the desk. By the time I get my chair and monitors jacked up so I can put my feet on the floor without bending my knees, my knees hit the edge of the desk and I have to sit back from the desk and lean in to type. It's a mess so I usually just remote desktop in from my laptop, kick back, and put my feet up on my desk.</p>
