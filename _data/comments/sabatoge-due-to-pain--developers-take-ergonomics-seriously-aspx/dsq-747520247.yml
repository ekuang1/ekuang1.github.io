message: <p>Its funny you should post this today.<br>Over the last two weeks, I have started to notice a burning pain in my index fingers around my knuckle and first joint (mainly my left index finger). After going to the doctor I was told that it is the start of arthritis.<br>This really stinks as I am only 26 years old!<br>I attribute this mainly to the fact that I type with my index finger more than I should instead of using the proper fingers for the proper keys.</p>
