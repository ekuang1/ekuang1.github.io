message: <p>I do not understand--why do you quote the DataHand web site and provide a link; yet, you do not talk about using a DH keyboard??? The chair is only a small fraction of the issue. I can have the best chair in the world, and I still cannot work more than a half day on any other keyboard. I have been using a DH keyboard for close to two decades and could not function without it.</p>
