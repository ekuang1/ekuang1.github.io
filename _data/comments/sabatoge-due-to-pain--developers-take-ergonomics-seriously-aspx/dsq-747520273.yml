message: <p>@Rick - Definitely getting blood flow moving is important. That's probably part of my stretching routine.<br>But also consider that I was having these problems when I was playing basketball 3 times a week and soccer twice a week. So lack of activity was not my issue.<br>The body is interconnected in many ways. For example, my head would kind of jut forward which caused my shoulders to tense, putting pressure on the nerve that runs through the elbow to my wrists. So a lot of my wrist pain originated from my back and shoulders.</p>
