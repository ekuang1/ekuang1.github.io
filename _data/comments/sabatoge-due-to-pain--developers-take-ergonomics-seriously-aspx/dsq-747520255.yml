message: <p>It took me until I was 35 years old to start to have any pain in my arm. It's in my right, but I place the blame solely on the crappy desks and chairs my employer provides. Usually after about 2 hours of work, the pain is annoying enough that I stop. I take the laptop out to either the cafeteria or the foyer where the nice chairs are and remote into my workstation. Sometimes I'll just change my chair position and use the laptop in my office.</p>
