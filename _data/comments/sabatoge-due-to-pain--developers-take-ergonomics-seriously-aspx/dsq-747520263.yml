message: <p>I don't get it. I'm like 34 and I've been programming since I was like 10 and I still haven't had anything like this happen to me. I slouch. I use a crufty old Dell QuietKey keyboard (the white ones with the REAL springs under the keys, not those new junk black ones). I sit in a 60's era Men In Black style chair. My desk is a drafting table so my screen is waaaaay farther away than it should be.<br>Am I a mutant? Did I start coding so long ago by body adapted before it was finished developing? Or maybe I'm just able to relax better durning downtime?<br>I refuse to believe any of my questions so there must be something I'm doing that you guys could do that would allow you to go back to programmer posture (slouching) and not have to use those evil ergo-keyboards.<br>Off topic, but I've decided one of the best ways to keep people from using your computer is to replace your normal keyboard with one of those finger-tanglers/ergo-keyboards. How can anyone type on those things? I have to switch to two finger typing...</p>
