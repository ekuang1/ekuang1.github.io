message: <p>One more thing.  I don't usually have pain in my arms, hands or anything.  But I did for a while about a year ago.  That is, until I realized all the pain was caused by the Microsoft Notebook mouse I was using.<br>It's amazing how long it took me to realize it.  I'd use my desktop with a Logitech G5 and have no problem.  I'd sit down with my laptop and after an hour my arm would hurt.  This went on for like six months before I realized what was going on.(dum dum)  So I finally bought a G5 to use with my notebook.<br>I'm also a fan of the keytronic keyboards, namely the lifetime series.<br>And one more thing, I find most desks are too high... at 29".  It's better if they are down around 27-28".  I can't use keyboard trays, as then I'm whacking my knees on them.<br>Also it's better to have your monitor up at eye height, so you don't have to crunch over.  I wrote up more at my blog <a href="http://inceptum.blogspot.com/2007/01/more-ergonomic-changes.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://inceptum.blogspot.com/2007/01/more-ergonomic-changes.html">a few months back</a>.</p>
