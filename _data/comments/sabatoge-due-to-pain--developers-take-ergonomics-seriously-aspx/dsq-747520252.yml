message: <p>Second on all of this.<br>Back in '99 I bought a Herman Miller Equa 2 chair.  Mainly because I wanted something comfortable, and the $200 officemax specials would break after 1-2 years and i was tired of that.  The Equa has been a very comfortable chair, but the bottom seat pad is now showing wear.<br>The local herman miller dealer will reupolster it for $100.  So I'm going to do that, and set it up as my girlfriends chair.  This then allows me to buy something new for myself.  I've been looking at the Aerons.  I also looked at the Humanscale Freedom.<br>I'm going to have to go look at the Steelcase Leap though.<br>One of my main things... I like to lean back.  Chairs which tilt from the center are bad, I prefer the tilt from the front of the chair like the Equa or Aeron.  I also find a higher backed chair is more comfortable.</p>
