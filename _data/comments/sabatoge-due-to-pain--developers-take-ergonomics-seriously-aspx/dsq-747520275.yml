message: <p>I have just this year started having problems.  Mainly my right hand, and my right shoulder.  It got to so bad that it felt like sandpaper was grating in my shoulder every time I would move the mouse.  I've started using a trackball at work, made my work buy me an OK chair, and have a keyboard tray that goes up and down.  Since then, nothing has gotten worse, but nothing has really gotten better.  I notice that at home where I have none of this setup it makes everything worse really quick. 600 bucks for a chair...I'll probably have to sell my two kids.<br>I have been thinking about upgrading the home office though.  Hopefully soon.  It has actually made me not want to get on the computer at home, the only time I do my "hobby" coding.  Good tips though on both blog posts.  I'll have to give some of those a try and see if that helps me out.</p>
