message: <p>I think a lot can be done without buying expensive products.  My setup at work is very uncomfortable because the desk is so high.  At home I work on a desk made out of a door, and my "chair" is an unused home audio subwoofer sitting on top of an old computer -- but it's very comfortable because the angles are all right.</p>
