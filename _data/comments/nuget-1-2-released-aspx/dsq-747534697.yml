message: <p>Awesome, have been fully embracing NuGet in my company.<br>We have one fiddly issue you may be able to enlighten us on (or do a post!). How to build a NuGet package that supports multiple framework versions to be created from a project file. <br>We have managed to automate creation of NuGet Packages for a single framework version, including updating of package version to match current assembly version without a problem but the multiple versions in one build has stumped us.<br>Cheers!</p>
