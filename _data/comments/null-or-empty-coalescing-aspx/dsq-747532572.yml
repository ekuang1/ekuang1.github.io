message: <p>Andy Edinborough's extension method (shown above in the comments) is pretty much exactly what I've been using... It's worked quite well for me.  <br>I've also used the same general approach (with generics) for handling null objects (if null, then use provided default value) -- although I'd like to figure a nice way to make it lazy (so that it doesn't evaluate my default value at all unless needed).</p>
