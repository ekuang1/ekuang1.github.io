message: <p>E-gads, it's been over four days and still no bill-pay!  My conversation with customer service was pretty useless as well... they had absolutely NO IDEA when the system would be working again.  As an IT manager, I find this shocking to believe... if we ever released something that put all our customers out of service, it would have been rolled back in the first hour... yet WAMU seems content to let it ride...<br>I hear Wachovia's online checking is pretty decent; I'll probably be switching to them tomorrow.</p>
