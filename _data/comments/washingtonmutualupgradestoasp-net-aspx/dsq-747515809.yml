message: <p>I, too am getting fed up with how long we have gone without bill pay. So I am ready to vote with my feet! Any good recommendations? I like the interest bearing Platinum Checking that I get at WaMu. Is there a bank that has a comparable account and a good website?<br>I hope the CIO gets fired over this. He should!</p>
