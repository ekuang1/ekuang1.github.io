message: <p>I tried to use WAMU online bill pay on Tues, 7/25/2006.  A message said the service was temporarily unavailable.  Now the service just gives errors.  I am writing paper checks today.  No big deal for me.  However, it is funny that this may be caused by a Microsoft upgrade.  A few weeks ago my computer started pestering me about urgent upgrades.  It was a Microsoft compliance program that determined that my OS was legitimate.  I even had to close all my work and reboot the computer to accept the "upgrade".  Microsoft has no hesitation to waste my time, and this is another example of that.  This is one computer user who is not waiting for the next Microsoft OS.</p>
