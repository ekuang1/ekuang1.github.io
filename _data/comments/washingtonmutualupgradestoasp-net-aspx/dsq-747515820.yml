message: <p>I have a newly opened business account with WAMU and have been able to get online exactly once in the past 2 weeks since I opened the account.  As of today, I am awaiting the return to functionality of the password reset function since I was locked out when I started typing swear words into the login screen after 50 + attempts to login over the past few weeks ;-)<br>Interestingly, while I was waiting for the reset password email to come this morning while talking with the WAMU phone rep, I got an email from another bank advertising their business banking.  I mention that to the rep and her comment was "that might be wise"....</p>
