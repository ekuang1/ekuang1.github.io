message: <p>Talk about suck!  I noticed it was down earlier this week and thought, 'oh well, I will try later...'  I used it to pay two bills, that only took about 20 minutes and two web browsers.  It was not a problem with Firefox, because when I went to IE, it still sucked!<br>Now instead of being able to pay multiple bills at once, I had to use an even slower web page to pay each bill individually.  In only one transaction, I was ready to switch banks.<br>I love my online bill paying.  I sure hope WaMu at least fixes it to be as good as how it used to be.  As it is now, it is not usable for me.  My line in the sand.... Fix it or I will use my BofA account.<br>Kevin</p>
