message: <p>Another alternative would be to call RenderView("New", article) in the Create action instead of RedirectToAction("New").<br>That way you don't have to deal with TempData and, since you did not persist anything yet, you won't be affected by refreshes/reposts of the previous request. Only the browser's URL will change.</p>
