message: <p>@Sergio I remember now why I didn't put the object in TempData. TempData uses the Session to store values temporarily. If you're using a State Server or database as the session store, you need to mark your object as <code>Serializable</code>.<br>Easy enough to do with <code>Article</code>. I think I just have a tendency to not put objects in session as a holdover from my VB6 days. ;) I like putting primitives and loading from primitives.</p>
