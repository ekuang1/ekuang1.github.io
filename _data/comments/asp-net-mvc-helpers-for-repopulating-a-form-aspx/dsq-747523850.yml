message: <p>You guys really need to back off on the whole generation of dictionaries from anonymous types routine. A large number of people are going to read all of these posts and start to head down a path towards death by reflection overhead. Use dictionaries as dictionaries. If you really find constructing them to be a chore, it is incredibly easy to create a very nice-looking fluent interface that builds dictionaries of lists and/or objects and/or other dictionaries, ripe for use in semi-structured data scenarios, and all with minimal syntactic and mental complexity as well as with none of the perf issues.</p>
