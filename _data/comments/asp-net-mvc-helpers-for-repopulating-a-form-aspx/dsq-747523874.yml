message: <p>Is anyone else worried that since we've had extension methods as part of the language not a blog post goes by without some scenario or other being 'solved' through their use? In fact you could say the same for the anonymous types as dictionary trick as well. <br>Does the saying 'When you're a hammer everything looks like a nail' apply a bit here?<br>Perhaps I'm being overly pessimistic but I'm worried that this framework is in danger of losing a coherent architecture and sense of overall direction in a favour of a load of syntactic fluff and 'trivially simple' examples that look good in a blog post but are essentially useless in a real world application.<br>I personally am not interested in the 'write a blog application in 15 minutes' type stuff, I want to see how this framework helps me to write scalable, maintainable, testable real world code, and I want evidence that some thought has indeed gone into making this the real focus of the framework rather than it just being a toy.<br>Sorry to rant, I'm really on board with what you guys are trying to do here, I just really want it to be brilliant.</p>
