message: <p>I concur with removing hungarian notion in the sense of using "txt" to represent a textbox and "chk" to represent a checkbox. On the other hand, I am a big fan of naming server controls/ UI controls by a similar prefix. I read a post about it and it made a lot of sense (with code-behind) anyhow. The author suggested using "ui" or "ux" ("ui" is a bit too cluttered in Intellisense) before all IDs as a way for developers to know that a given variable in the code-behind is not just a variable, but a control. While this convention may be useless in MVC, it still would be nice to have a way to map control IDs to properties in the UpdateFrom function without too much reflection/magic.<br>Just my .02</p>
