message: <p>Hello,<br>As I understand there is no real need to start with VS 2010. I'll start with VS 2008 and migrate to VS2010 with release of the RC.<br>Through your post I read that there is some black vodoo magic done for some features in .NET 4.0. Are there many other features of MVC 2 that are supported only in VS2010 ? I would like to be defintely sur which version of VS to use.<br>Thanks</p>
