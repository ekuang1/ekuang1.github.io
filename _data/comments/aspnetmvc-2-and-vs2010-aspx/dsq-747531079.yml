message: <p>Thanks, you just saved me some trouble.  I just installed both on a Virtual PC at home and was about to start playing around with MVC 2 tonight.  If I installed VS2008 side by side on that virtual PC should that cause any problem you can think of?  I wanted to use VS2010 to do some silverlight 3, and 08 to do MVC 2 at this point.</p>
