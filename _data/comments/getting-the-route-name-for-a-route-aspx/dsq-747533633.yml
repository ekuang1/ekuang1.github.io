message: <p>This code doesn't need to repeat anything:<br>routes.MapRoute("rName", "{controller}/{action}").SetRouteName("rName");<br><br>Behold!<br>var routeName = "rName";<br>routes.MapRoute(routeName, "{controller}/{action}").SetRouteName(routeName);<br>... Of course, this may still not sit well with you; even with the string literal pulled out into one place, you do still have to repeat the routeName variable (still a little clunky).</p>
