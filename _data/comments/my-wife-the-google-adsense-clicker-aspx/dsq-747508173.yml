message: <p>Hi Guys,<br><br><br><br>Maybe one of you can help me out here..<br><br>I've added some google ads on my website and the first couple of days it was generating about $50,- each day.. After that the payout dropped dramaticly.. I have the same ammount of visitors, clicks and practicly the same links but I now have an average of 0.40,- per 1000 impressions..<br><br>Wich is very low I think.. I also tried getting very high paid keywords on my site. I made a database of all high paid words and added them on a seperate page. But even those clicks seems to be worth only 0,2 ct (still online on <a href="http://www.hitz4you.ws/adsense.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.hitz4you.ws/adsense.php">http://www.hitz4you.ws/adsense.php</a>)<br><br><br><br>I've read a lot about guys earning 10 to 100 dollars for one click and would like to know how.. If someone can help me with this I'm willing to offer free google ad impressions on my page wich currently has 50.000 daily unique visitors. Let me know if you cen help me (mainframe@planet.nl)<br><br><br><br>Kindest Regards,<br><br>Danny<br><br></p>
