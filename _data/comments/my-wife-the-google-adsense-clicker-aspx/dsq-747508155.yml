message: "<p>Someone mentioned that it's tracked via IP address only. I'd say, cookies are a pretty powerful tool and why wouldn't they be used? IP addresses change on a daily basis, so most likely the cookie would be the only remaining piece of info still in tact to distinguish a repeat clicker. In addition user agents, screen resolutions, operating systems, tracebacks for ISP info, particular routers that visitor might be comming through, GEOIP information. All of these technique provide for a very strong click/visitor tracking detection.<br><br><br><br>My advise: Just make a better site. Learn some search engine marketing techniques, and stay away from something that could put you in prison over BS.<br><br><br><br><br><br>--PuRe <a href=\"http://www.pureehosting.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"www.pureehosting.com\">www.pureehosting.com</a></p>"
