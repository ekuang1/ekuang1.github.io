message: <p>Hey, I see web hosting services and placed google adsense ads to my website, now I generate about $30.00 a day.  Not sure if it is worth it, or if I could have had those visitors who clicked at my google ads actually purchase my web hosting services instead of going to my competitors sites through adsense. (hmm, its either a quick $35.00 per month, or a nice $29.95 subscription payment from a new web hosting customers for my business)</p>
