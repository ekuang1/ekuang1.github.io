message: <p>Google Tracks Your Clicks Pretty Much Every Way you can think of,  Cookies, they record everything about every person who clicks an ad (EX, What Browser, IP Address, What OS, What was the Last Website Visited Etc) and they review it on Pay Out, im pretty sure that if you email the Adsense Staff, Tell Them How Many Clicks You Received that day (or apx how many your wife clicked), they should be able to had a flag on the account, and delete the income she granted. How Ever if you violate the Google TOS again, (which you proably wont, but your not suppose to tell ppl to click your ads, for all those who left comments), then you should be good. <br>Thanks IT Officer Lovell<br><a href="Http://www.supaebooks.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Http://www.supaebooks.com">Http://www.supaebooks.com</a></p>
