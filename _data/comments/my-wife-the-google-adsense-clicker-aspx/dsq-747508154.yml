message: <p>You can falsify adsence clicks for big returns using the following method:<br><br><br><br>-Get a BIG list of Port 80 Web Proxies say 10,000<br><br>-Download a FREE copy of AUTOIT windows automation software.<br><br>- Write a windows macro which refreshes your page with the ads on it, then clicks on all ad links and then opens the IE connections properties selects the next proxy server and then enters it in the connection settings. Make sure you set the macro to delet cookies and then re run the whole process cycling through all proxies on auto.<br><br><br><br>P&gt;S&gt; Someone made a tremendous ammount of money using a lesser developed technique and then few months later made it into a nice comfortable prison cell courtesy of googles lawyers. SO DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TROUBLE.<br><br><br><br>Mike.</p>
