message: <p>&gt; Also, the true artist does not create art for his or her audience. The artist creates art for the sake of art, the audience be damned!<br><br><br><br>I'm not sure this is entirely true; artists have to make money too. And art that won't sell doesn't make money. Only the extraordinarily lucky and/or talented artists have the luxury of doing whatever they want and waiting for the money to come to them.</p>
