message: <p>Hey, you're the russian. I figured you'd know someone back east.  ;)<br><br><br><br>As for a unified authentication/trust architecture, haven't you heard of Microsoft Passport?  ;) I jest.<br><br><br><br>I don't know of any.  I don't think the community trust each other enough to build a trust architecture. ;)<br><br><br><br>There are several ideas that improve trust though.  <br><br><br><br>Whitelisting whereby anyone you've allowed to post before automatically can post again.  Blacklisting is an obvious approach, but do it based on the posted urls and the IPs for the urls and not just the referrer (as that can be spoofed. Everything can be spoofed).<br><br><br><br>I've thought about doing something where you automatically trust trackbacks from anyone in your OPML. etc... etc...<br><br><br><br>The weakness in all these approaches is how do you authenticate people without being too intrusive?<br><br><br><br>You could go the fort knox approach and require people create accounts with a valid email address (which you confirm via an email and confirmation link).  <br><br><br><br>But for most of us, that would essentially turn away everybody.  Then, you have people who would provide insightful comments not even trying, and that leaves only comment spammers trying to post comments on your blog.<br><br><br><br>I've written about this before (<a href="https://haacked.com/category/15.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://haacked.com/category/15.aspx">https://haacked.com/category/15.aspx</a>), but maybe I should write an updated post now that I've spent more time in the trenches.<br><br></p>
