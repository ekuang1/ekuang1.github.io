message: <p>Haven't read all the comments. Did see a similar thing in CodeIgniter, which has an Inflector helper [ <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/helpers/inflector_helper.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/helpers/inflector_helper.html">codeigniter.com/.../inflector_helper.html</a> ]. Inflection seems to be the right term, and also seems quite complicated [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection</a> ].</p>
