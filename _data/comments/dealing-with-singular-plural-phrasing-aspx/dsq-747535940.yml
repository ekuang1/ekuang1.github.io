message: "<p>As noted earlier, different languages have quite a variance in their representation of grammatical:<br><em>+ Singular/Plural.</em> The base form is singular; the plural form is inflected.<br><em>+ Singulative/Plural.</em> Inverse of above: the base form is plural; the singulative form is inflected. To complicate thing, in Russian and Arabic, the singulative form always has feminine gender regardless of the base word's gender.<br><em>+ Singular/Dual/Plural.</em> Some languages differentiate between singular (1), dual(2) and collective (&gt;2, many).<br><em>+ Singular/Dual/Trial/Plural.</em> And, just to spice it up a bit, some languages toss in a trial (3) form for pronouns (but not nouns), to boot.<br>It gets further complicated because in some languages, the inflected form will change not only based on the count, but on gender and case as well. <br></p>"
