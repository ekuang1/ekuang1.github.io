message: "<p>@pop catalin: 'no real benefit' - this is why most developers shouldn't be making UX decisions. I'm fairly sure you believe this is true, but if you're building a product where customer experience is important, generating grammatically incorrect output is not a good look (or, in my view, correct code). <br>Yes, localization is hard. Accept the fact you're going to have to invest a fair bit of additional development if you want the reap the rewards of a larger market. Don't use it as an excuse for mediocrity.</p>"
