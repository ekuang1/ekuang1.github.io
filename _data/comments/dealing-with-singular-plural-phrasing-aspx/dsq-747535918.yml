message: '<p># Install-Package Pluralizer<br>Allows very nice conventions such as (I use an extension method "Pluralize" to shorten even more):<br>var str = "There {is} {_} {person}.";<br>var single = Pluralizer.Instance.Pluralize(str, 1);<br>Assert.AreEqual("There is 1 person.", single);<br>var plural = Pluralizer.Instance.Pluralize(str, 67);<br>Assert.AreEqual("There are 67 people.", plural);<br>Following these simple rules:<br>1) start by writing the sentence in its singular form.<br>2) wrap any words that you want “pluralized” in curly braces<br>3) nouns are handled automatically by the built-in PluralizationService class in Entity Framework for .NET 4<br>4) only the most simple verbs and pronouns are automatically handled. You’ll probably have to handle those by yourself, separated by the pipe character.<br>5) the number itself is displayed using the special underscore placeholder (i.e. write this to get the number itself printed: {_})<br>6) manually define the singular and plural words by separating them with a pipe character (e.g. {singular|plural}).</p>'
