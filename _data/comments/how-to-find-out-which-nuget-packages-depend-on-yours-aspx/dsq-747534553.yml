message: <p>Janier kind of beat me to this but I was thinking you need some kind of alias functionality.  That is, change the package name to Mvc2Futures, add an alias named MicrosoftWebMvc.  <br>Coupled with the ability to mark packages obsolete (Brian's suggestion), this should cover most of the common scenarios.</p>
