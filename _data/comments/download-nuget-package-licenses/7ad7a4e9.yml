  As of today, on Visual Studio 2019 this didn't work until I removed the unique sort piece. It's useless anyway, since if it downloads the same license a few times it doesn't really matter. Also,many licenses are html so the .txt is not as applicable as it may have been in the past. Thanks though, this was great!
