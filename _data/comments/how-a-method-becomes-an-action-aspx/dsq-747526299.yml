message: "<p>Although they are distinct concepts, it's practical to have an action as a method of the same name.<br>With ActionName, the problem has just moved: You still have to find a name for \"ViewSomething\".<br>I think it's much simpler to adopt a solid naming convention. Instead of using \"View\", you can still use \"Index\", \"Details\", \"MyView\" or anything else.<br>Personally, the 2 methods with the same name (\"Edit\") is another bad example, as \"Edit\" can be used to display the form and \"Update\" to update the database (see <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/stephenwalther/archive/2008/06/27/asp-net-mvc-tip-11-use-standard-controller-action-names.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/stephenwalther/archive/2008/06/27/asp-net-mvc-tip-11-use-standard-controller-action-names.aspx\">weblogs.asp.net/.../...ontroller-action-names.aspx</a>).<br>According to me, ActionName was a waste of time.<br>I don't know when I will update my application to Preview 5, as it seems that there are a lot of breaking changes (See <a href=\"http://forums.asp.net/1146.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://forums.asp.net/1146.aspx\">http://forums.asp.net/1146.aspx</a>). Now I am a bit afraid.<br></p>"
