message: <p>Simone, thanks for the tip. I corrected my post. The thing is, an action has always been a string that just happened to map to a method on a controller. All along, you could have written action filters that change that string, thus destroying the tenuous connection between an action name and method.<br>For strongly typed checking, there are other techniques you can use, such as a static class of custom made route values so that all your strings are in one place. etc... Use your imagination, I think you'll figure out other ideas.<br>Remember, the request starts off as a string, even if we took away ActionName, that doesn't suddenly make the URL helpers work in all cases.</p>
