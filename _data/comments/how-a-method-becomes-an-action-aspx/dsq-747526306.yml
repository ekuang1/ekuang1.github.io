message: <p>@Steve @Justice The ability to have the strongly typed URL helpers was already an illusion, though a compelling one. There were many other ways that an action might not correspond to a method of the same name. For example, a filter might have tweaked things, a custom route could tweak things, a controller factory could tweak things, a custom action invoker could tweak things.<br><br><br><br>An action truly is just a string, as is an URL. Routing and MVC are loosely coupled. We could try really really hard to tightly couple the two and make the action-to-method a one-to-one mapping, but to make that really work, we'd have to remove all those layers of extensibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, we're moving the strongly typed helpers to MvcFutures. If you don't use any of these extensibility layers, they'll sort of work. But we don't want to support them given that at all layers, you can cause a breakage inadverdently via the extensibility layers. The fact that an action really is a logical concept is not something we made up. It's been that way all along. We're just trying to expose that fact so people are aware of it and the consequences of treating it otherwise.</p>
