message: <p>Great post Phil. <br>I agree completely with the "action is just a logical construct" concept as it enforces loose coupling from View to Controller. <br>I'm relieved to see the ASP.NET MVC architects finally help express this for developers via these new additions in preview 5.<br>Frankly, while undeniably tempting, I consider controller lambda expressions being used in a view as a gross violation of the pattern! <br></p>
