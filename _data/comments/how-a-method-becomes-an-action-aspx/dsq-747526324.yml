message: "<p>Phil said: \"An action truly is just a string.\" Okay, then I want some function call that'll generate an action string to refer to a specific controller method.<br>I don't often tweak action names via filters, custom routes, controller factories, or custom action invokers. I *do* often use links from web pages to other web pages. Having to use \"magic strings\" for this is not a workable option for large sites; there's no type checking of arguments, and it's very hard to trace down all the places which call a specific method if I change that method's name or arguments.<br>It seems right now that strongly-typed link helpers are somewhat broken (in MVC 1, at least); an action I invoke via Html.RenderAction&lt;MyController&gt;(c =&gt; c.MyAction()) will have any Html.ActionLink() calls in its view spit out empty hrefs. I was hoping things would improve in MVC 2, but instead it looks like MVC 2 is moving farther from this and closer to magic strings!<br>Am I supposed to tough up and tolerate magic strings, or is there a best-of-both-worlds way out there?<br></p>"
