message: <p>Phil, I think the routing rule in the sample should be {controller}/{action}/{id}, no {id}/{action}/{id}<br>And about the ActionName attribute. This is a nice way to add many view with the same name, but I really like the correspondence between methods and actions since it allowed the Url&lt;t&gt; helpers that provided compile-time check and intellisense when writing redirect to actions and url to actions.<br>So, not sure whether to like this new feature or not :)</p>
