message: <p>Phil,<br>I attended both of your MVC2 sessions for Dell. We've already started employing some of your suggestions as best practices on our team. <br>For those asking about working at Dell, check out <a href="http://dice.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="dice.com">dice.com</a>. I just started here as a contractor about a month ago. Moved here from NH to take the position. I can say that the folks on my team treat contractors very well, including letting us spend a day listening to Microsoft.<br>Thanks again for coming to Round Rock!<br>Mike</p>
