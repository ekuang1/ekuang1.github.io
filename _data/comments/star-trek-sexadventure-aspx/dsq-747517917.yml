You can't pleasure her with this! \"; }<br></blockquote><p><br>Also, how he breaks down this process in comments:<br></p><blockquote><br>/* arousal and issexready are very important control variables. issexready is a boolean<br>   value, which indicates whether or not she is even viewing the player as a potential<br>   sexual partner at all yet. The first check for all sexual actions and requests looks at<br>   issexready first, and returns NotReady or NotReadyAsk. For instance, if you sat down<br>   next to a woman on the bus and asked her for a hummer, you would receive a NotReadyAsk<br>   response. Depending on the character, and how mean you are, the response from a<br>   NotReadyX response could be rather nasty. If she issexready, then each action has some<br>   sort of arousal threshold, such as blowthresh, and we will check to see if her arousal,<br>   a numeric value, is =&gt; that thresh. If so, execute the corresponding description<br>   function, in this case blowdesc. If she is not aroused enough, issue the NotReady or<br>   NotReadyAsk method. For instance, let's say the player did a girl's dishes and fixed the<br>   washing machine, thus letting her relax, and making her grateful to him. If this is<br>   enough to open her eyes to his obvious physical attractiveness (issexready := true;) she<br>   is still unlikely to let him jam his face between her legs right off, so her NotEnough<br>   method should be executed if he tried. NotEnoughX routines should be at least different,<br>   and probably less harsh in tone than NotReadyX routines should be. */<br></blockquote>"
