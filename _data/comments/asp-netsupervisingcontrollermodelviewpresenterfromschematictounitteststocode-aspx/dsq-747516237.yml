message: <p>Hi Phil<br>I enjoyed reading your post as always.  <br>I read your post and downloaded the source code and in my opinion the pattern that you are implementing there looks more like ‘passive view’ than ‘supervising controller’. <br>With ‘supervising controller’ in most cases the view is in charge of updating its display (like after post is saved), the controller updates the view display only where more complex logic involved (example for complex logic is – reading model state and deciding how to change the view), with ‘passive view’ on the other hand - the presenter alone is in charge of updating the view.<br>So in my opinion, MVP should be called ‘supervising controller’ to stress the point that the view has the responsibility to stay synchronized with model data, if that is not the case - the pattern should be called ‘passive view’ so we'll know that the presenter is in charge of the entire workflow and it is the one that got the responsibility to update the view. <br>In your post (like in most ASP.NET solutions) the view has (and should have) no interaction with the model so ‘supervising controller’ is not the best name - even though it is not a mistake.<br></p>
