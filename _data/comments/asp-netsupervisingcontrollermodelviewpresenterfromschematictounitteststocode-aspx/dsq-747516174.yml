message: <p>I like your approach with using events to drive the controller. It seems like a much more object oriented approach of an event model.<br>Once question I have though that was not covered in your post, where would you run validation checks? I assume in the view? or would that task be sent to the domain model to check against the specific domain objects?<br>Thats for the posting! I'm trying to implement it in my next project and so far so good!<br>Sean</p>
