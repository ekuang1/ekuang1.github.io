message: <p>I know this makes me look like a stupid programmer, but I don't get it.<br>I mean, this is a lot of work for such a simple form.  And because my client (and myself) like to change the page even after it is finished, this adds to the complexity.<br>I am all about doing what is "right", but I just don't get this.  It would appear to severely lengthen the time it would take to create each page, and make it that much tougher for change requests.  All for what exactly?<br>Maybe my lack of a CS degree is finally catching up to me.  Or the first season of The OC I was forced to watch killed my remaining brain cells that allowed my to understand software patterns.</p>
