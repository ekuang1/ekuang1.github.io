message: "<p>Thanks for your comments all!<br>@Mike: Good question and worthy of its own <a href=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/09/TyingMVPToTheASP.NETEventModel.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"response\">blog post</a>:<br>@Bill: Great tips. Regarding the reference to presenter, in real apps, I sort of mix both events and methods. I stick mostly to events because I can still control security via the event handler code.<br>Regarding DataBind(), since I'm focused on ASP.NET, I thought it was an ok trade off. I thought long and hard about it. For what you are doing, you could have a PauseUpdate() and ContinueUpdate() method (or something like that. I forget the corresponding methods in WinForms) so that you could set multiple view properties without calling DataBind each time.<br>IContext! Love it!<br>@Kevin: I supplied all the unit tests in the download. Maybe I can have a follow up post with just code ;)<br>And I love the tip about the events! Awesome!</p>"
