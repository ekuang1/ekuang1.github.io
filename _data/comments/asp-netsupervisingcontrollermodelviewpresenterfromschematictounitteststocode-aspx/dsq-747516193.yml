message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Thanks for the great example. I am a TDD newbie (done lots of research but struggling to put it into practice) and am trying to reproduce this example from scratch. In the process I am running into difficulties and was hoping you could give me some hints.<br>Firstly, the purist TDD approach seems to be "don't write code without a failing test". I have a lot of trouble getting going without writing at least a view interface first without a test so I can start working on the controller (as you appear to have done). Is this just a case of needing to be more realistic than following the letter of the gospel-according-to-Beck? :)<br>I also tend to end up writing a BlogPost class and basic "IBlogRepository" (model/data access interface which I stub out) pretty quickly without directly required to do so by a test. <br>Basically I end up taking big steps to implement LoadPost and SavePost tests. I would like to code it in smaller steps but in this example and in others I try I always end up getting stuck with large steps.  I'd love to get any hints you have on this.<br>Regards,<br>David <br></p>
