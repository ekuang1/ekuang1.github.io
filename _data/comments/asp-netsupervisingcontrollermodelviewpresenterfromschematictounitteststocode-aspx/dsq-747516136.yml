message: <p>True. I generally create my presenter in Page_Init, but of course that means you can't handle Init in the presenter without some sort of manual call. Guess I rarely do anything in Page_Init. :) <br>Page_PreInit should also work, but again  it may complicate handling of that event if you need it.</p>
