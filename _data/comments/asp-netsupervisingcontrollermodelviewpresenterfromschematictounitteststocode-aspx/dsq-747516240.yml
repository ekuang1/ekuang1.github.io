message: <p>Phil,<br>Thank you so much for this post. I have been reading so much about ASP.NET MVC lately but am unable to bring myself to deploy a beta or RC into a production environment. This pattern and example has helped me write better and more testable code for my ASP.NET webforms. Thanks again, and keep up the great work!</p>
