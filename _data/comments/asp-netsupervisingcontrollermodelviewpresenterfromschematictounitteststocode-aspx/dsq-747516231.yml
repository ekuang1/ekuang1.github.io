message: <p>Hi and thank you for a great post.<br>I'm using <a href="http://vb.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="vb.net">vb.net</a> and cannot get the IView interface working.<br>I've no problem with the Init/Load events but IsPostBack, IsValid and DataBind requires the page where I implement the interface to implement these properties/subs.<br>Here's my <a href="http://vb.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="vb.net">vb.net</a> code:<br><code><br>Public Interface IView<br>Delegate Sub Init(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)<br>Delegate Sub Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)<br>ReadOnly Property IsPostBack() As Boolean<br>Sub DataBind()<br>ReadOnly Property IsValid() As Boolean<br>End Interface<br></code><br>The specific error message is:<br>Class 'MyPage' must implement 'ReadOnly Property IsValid() As Boolean' for interface 'IView'. Implementing property must have matching 'ReadOnly' or 'WriteOnly' specifiers.<br>Somebody who knows how to write the proper interface to get this working?<br>Thanks,</p>
