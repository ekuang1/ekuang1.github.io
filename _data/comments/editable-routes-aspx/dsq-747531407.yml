message: <p>Changing properties of the applications without needing to recompile only has is useful when you don't need a programmer. To configure the routes, you need to know how the controller code looks like, so you probably need a programmer to change the routes like this. This cannot be done by a system administrator. When you need a programmer to make changes, why won't you just deploy a new dll?</p>
