message: <p>Phil,<br>I really liked the new point of view of this implementation.<br>This same path can be used to do a lot of things!<br>It's so good to be able to do things like that, I mean, the language and the framework has so many features that enable us to do amazing things in a few lines of code. This is developer power... or better yet, power on developer hands...<br>To monitor a file on disk and recompile the code generating a new assembly dynamically. Fantastic! :)<br>Thanks for showing us how to do that,<br>Leniel Macaferi</p>
