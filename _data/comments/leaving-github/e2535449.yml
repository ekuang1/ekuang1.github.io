message: Optimize for happiness seems so foreign to me. It definitely works in smaller environment, but not so much at large scale. But what a crazy ride you had. Most people don't get to see that scope of growth over a number of years like that. Congrats, and I wish you and your family the best in stabilizing. Having some of my own parenting challenges, I admire your courage to confront the challenges and work with your son.
