message: <p>&gt; decide to go ahead and upgrade the version of the Framework hosting <br>&gt; your application without recompiling<br>If Microsoft customers are being so negligent in application lifecycle concerns, then it would be hard not to walk the cat back to Microsoft's own traditional unwillingness to provide meaningful, ethical, and responsible guidance to the customers who still look to Microsoft for guidance.<br>If Scott Gu or Soma S would just get together and post a blog saying that this kind of thing is reckless and irresponsible, and that the tools and processes to support safer means of asset management are easily and readily available (unless we're talking about heavyweight, high-ceremony stuff like TFS), then the whole Microsoft customer developer ecosystem ball might actually start to move forward in a meaningful way, with customers' interested put well before Microsoft's own interests.<br>Just a thought.</p>
