message: <p>Jason, I tried to explain why ABC is better for evolving APIs in a talk that is accessible at <a href="http://www.researchchannel.org/prog/displayevent.aspx?rID=11087&amp;fID=2740" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.researchchannel.org/prog/displayevent.aspx?rID=11087&amp;fID=2740">http://www.researchchannel....</a>. The whole presentation is very long. The part about interfaces starts at 2:54.40.</p>
