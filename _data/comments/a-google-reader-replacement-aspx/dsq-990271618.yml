message: <p>Hi Phil.  The desktop reader I was thinking of at the nerd dinner last night was "NewsGator."  What was great about that, along with it sitting in an Outlook PST, was that it provided both Outlook and Windows Desktop Search integration.  After NewsGator wasn't available, I used RSS Bandit for a while but I switched to FeedDemon as soon as that became freely available.  I lost my machine with FeedDemon on it, although I have salvaged its database.  Now I need to find out if I can reinstall FeedDemon and get it to read my immense collection of feed items without Google Reader available.  (I found its OPML file, but the existing database matters to me too.)<br>I've got over 600 feeds and that doesn't work in Feedly at all.  I really don't want a browser based reader.  I'll take a look at Go Read.</p>
