message: <p>If anyone is interested, I would like to discuss reinvigorating the Particls project ca. 2005-6 from SJK software. These folks were way ahead of their time and the platform actually worked really well to bring you random but highly relevant RSS stories. APML and Data Portability died on the vine IMO because it is a very threatening paradigm for people to have information sovereignty, but history has proven out the need for it.</p>
