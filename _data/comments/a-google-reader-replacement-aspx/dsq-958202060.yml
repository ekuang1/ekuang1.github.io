message: <p>While it's nice to see some suggestions for alternatives, it doesn't seem fair to offer a review critical of feedly without having at least opened the preferences.  There you will find options to format the feed in a variety of ways (I prefer the regular way, so I can't offer any criticism either), as well as the option to auto-mark articles as read when you scroll past them.</p>
