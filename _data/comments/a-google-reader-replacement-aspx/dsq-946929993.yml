message: <p>In Feedly, look down near the bottom of the menu at Preferences. There's an option for "Auto-Mark As Read On Scroll" that you might find interesting. I've switched to Feedly from Google Reader. I was a little uncertain at first but once I adjusted to the differences I've been very happy with it. Android app is pretty good too.</p>
