message: <p>I, too, prefer to use a separate layer to prepare my data for layout.<br>In the project I work at the moment, the Data returned by my services is transformed in a DataTable with all the right "strings" for layout presentation, and this DataTable can be databound to a Repeater, or a DataList, or a DataGrid depending on the situation.<br>I found this approach very easy to mantain, over the years.</p>
