message: <p>I agree with Karthik - I have a utility class that handles this just in case I need to make across the board changes - its all done in one place.<br>I here what phil is saying about having to recompile though as well.<br>this is where the design decisions come into playe.<br>for me, the utility methods are both easier to read and provide more "utility" because how often do you need to change something that is pretty much a standard  - ie if its empty then display "na", for example.<br>love the blog!</p>
