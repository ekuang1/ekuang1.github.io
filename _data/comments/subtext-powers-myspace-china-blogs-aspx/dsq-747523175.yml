message: <p>Any idea if the US (.com) version of Myspace has any future plans to use it as well, or would that even-larger jump in traffic cause more problems than the Chinese domain?<br>I have been considering adding Subtext to the <a href="http://www.theinfogroup.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.theinfogroup.com/">Dallas SEO</a> site but if the marketing we are doing brings a ton of visitors in a short amount of time, I would want to make sure the comment engine could handle it.  I know this post is quite old so if there has been patches to make sure Subtext can scale to any size, I would appreciate an update!</p>
