message: <p>We are looking to use a blogging system on our website (<a href="http://www.foureyez.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.foureyez.com/">FourEyez</a>. What benefit does this have over the other blogging systems such as Wordpress and Drupal etc? I've tried using the UK version of the MySpace bloggin system and didn't like it. Why would they use one for one country and not for another?<br>Thanks<br>Ryan</p>
