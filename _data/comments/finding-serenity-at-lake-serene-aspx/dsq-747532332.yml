message: <p>Man am I envious! Makes me think I should get my rear in gear, find a Seattle job and escape Phoenix. I did do the Mt Si hikes when I was up last month. But here's a few for you to check out too Phil:<br>Snow Lake (Leaves from Alpental Ski Are parking lot)<br><a href="http://www.blog.joelx.com/snow-lake-hiking-trip-snoqualmie-wa/1432/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.blog.joelx.com/snow-lake-hiking-trip-snoqualmie-wa/1432/">www.blog.joelx.com/.../1432/</a><br>And the there is a really neat day hike or even better backpack camping trip on the peninsula that takes off from lake Ozette:<br><a href="http://www.hikemasters.com/2009/08/ozette-coastal-wilderness-loop-olympic.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.hikemasters.com/2009/08/ozette-coastal-wilderness-loop-olympic.html">www.hikemasters.com/...</a><br>Ozette is a long but enjoyable drive out on to the penninsula and a really great time for 7-14 year olds if you happen to have any. I think your boy is still a little young from what I remember seeing him last month when you came by the Alt.Net meeting. Then again if you can pack him out there at low tide I think he would be fascinated by the sea creatures at low tide :-)<br>Enjoy! <br></p>
