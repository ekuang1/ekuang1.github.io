message: <p>Phil great stuff...especially in the mobile apps space.<br>Have you guys thought about a model for template generation that opens the door to third-party providers?  The new MVC template is a great improvement, but I'd love the chance to pick a template while the project is being created.  Even if it's something I have to buy offline and throw in a dir (but would prefer in-tool support, of course). <br>Cheers.</p>
