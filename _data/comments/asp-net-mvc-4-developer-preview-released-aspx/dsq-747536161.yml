message: <p>Excellent! We use MVC 3 but we really need the mobile support in MVC 4. However, when I click the link for the MVC 4 for VS2010 Preview it will not download the MVC 4 preview via the Web Platform Installer 3.0 saying "The product you are trying to install is not supported on your operating system." I am on Windows XP latest SP and I could always install and work with the other MVC versions. Is MVC 4 not supported on Windows XP? That would be a deal breaker for us.</p>
