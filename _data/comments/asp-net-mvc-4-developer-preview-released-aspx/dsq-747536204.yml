message: <p>So I have VS 2010 and 11 installed. I have MVC 4 installed. I see the projects in 2010, not in 11. I tried to reinstall MVC4, and it specifically says for VS 2010, and that it is already installed.<br>So back to an earlier question, is there a way to use MVC4 in Visual Studio 11. (And yes I have the full developer preview of Ultimate VS 11 installed.)<br>Thanks</p>
