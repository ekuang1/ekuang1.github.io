message: <p>@haacked, I think what you are doing with MVC is great I love the concept, but I do think your tempo on releases is a bit fast, due to the fragmentation it will bring. Already I have seen jobs advertised for MVC2 and MVC3 separately and soon MVC4? It doesnâ€™t give me, the developer, much time to learn a new methodology and put it into practice before I have to start looking into the next version.<br>Maybe, as mentioned in a post above, an intermediate release which adds some functionality (such as the mobile apps), without changing the framework much? I think this may increase the general engagement with developers?<br>Hope that makes sense. <br>Chris.<br></p>
