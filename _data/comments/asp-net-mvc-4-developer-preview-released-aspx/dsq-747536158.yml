message: <p>The mobile development stuff is great. MVC3 seems miles away from MVC2, especially with Service Locator, Razor and helpers.<br>MVC4 seems more like MVC 3 and a half. That shouldn't take away from the hard work you guys are doing.<br>But my MVC1 application (which I only wrote two years ago,) is already 2 versions out of date! I've had a few people ask me, is MVC a good long term platform to use since it changes so much, so quickly.<br>I'm not sure this is true, but maybe you should call it MVC 3.5? I think every project hits a point of stability. Just think of all the people who still using FoxPro and VisualBasic 6! Maintained by thousands of happy programmers every day!<br>ehm...<br>... yeah, I see your thinking...<br>Long live MVC4...</p>
