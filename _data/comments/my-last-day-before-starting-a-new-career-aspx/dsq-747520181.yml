message: <p>Phil,<br>You took a big step and I applaud your courage in doing so.  It's always difficult to walk away from something you helped build.  But I'm glad you recognized where you were going with your career and found something more in tune with your current direction.  Good luck and I wish you all the best in your new position with Koders!</p>
