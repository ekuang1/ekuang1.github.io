message: <p>I used to think I was a type one hop-from-project-to-project sort of person, but I've realized I need a lot in the way of closure and seeing the project I worked on actually be consumed and used, which you don't get as much if you've already moved on to the Next Big Thing.  There's definitely something to be said about type two development.  It's where I'm at, and I like it.<br>Good luck at Koders.  I'm sure you'll have a blast!</p>
