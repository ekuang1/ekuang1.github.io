message: <p>I absolutely agree with you, Jeff, and now Scott Mitchell.<br>However, I would lump the "Head First" books with the overly generalized "powerpoint" style Charles refers to.  I do not like being force fed data so many different ways.  Give me the data, add a nice demo, and that is it.  I don't need data, then demo, then sidebar, then another example, end of chapter test, all interspersed with jokes.</p>
