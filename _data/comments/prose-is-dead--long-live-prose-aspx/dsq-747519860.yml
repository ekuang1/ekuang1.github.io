message: <p>I would also add... the use of color for code examples in Nathan's book is helpfull because it duplicates the enviroment of VisualStudio. I find this usefull because that's the enviroment I'm in and therefore the visual cues I rely on. When i use Eclipse for Java I then expect a different sort of code highlighting and... would then appreciate books that use that.<br>So no prose is not dead... and I agree books on technologies like coding frameworks need to be interesting to look at.</p>
