message: <p>Bah. I own both books and use them as counterparts to each other. While Petzold's is more in depth than Nathan's, I can find what I'm looking for quicker in Nathans.<br>Oh, and one point that's being overlooked here. This is Windows <em>PRESENTATION</em> Foundation. It's all about how stuff looks.<br>Charles' book falls flat in this regard. You have to 'imagine' how the code is going to look after you write it. And oddly enough, it never shows up as gray backgrounded black text ;)<br>WPF Rocks, btw. Totally rocks.</p>
