message: <p>You can do sudo debugging checks in web site projects (vs web application projects) by checking the httpcontext.  For example, for one of our websites, we've developed some custom http modules that we turn on in our model office / production environment, but off for our dev environments.<br>In our dev environments, we have debugging="true" in web.config and in the others, we of course have debugging="false".<br>So, when you want to check for debugging being enabled, then instead of wrapping up your code like this:<br><code><br>#if DEBUG<br>   ... some code here<br>#else<br>   ... some other code here<br>#end if<br></code><br>You would do something like this:<br><code><br>  if (!HttpContext.Current.IsDebuggingEnabled)<br>  {<br>    // Production mode code here<br>  }<br>  else<br>  {<br>    // Debugging Code Here<br>  }<br></code><br>The obvious disadvantage of this method vs using compiler pre-directives is that all of your "debug" code is compiled into the final assembly.  So weigh your options and go from there.</p>
