message: <p>@kad1r I addreessed that in my post. <br></p><blockquote>Please note, that you still can’t request /web.config because that would try to request web.config in the root of your web application and ASP.NET won’t allow that for good reason!<br>You can't request a physical web.config file. Or any file with *.config extension.<br>@Bradley the official product name is ASP.NET MVC 2 without the decimal. The book as it's listed on Amazon needs a few corrections.</blockquote>
