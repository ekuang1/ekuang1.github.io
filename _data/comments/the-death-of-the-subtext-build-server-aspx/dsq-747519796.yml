message: <p>Doh!<br>Well hopefully you can find that backup image - but if not... have you tried hooking the HDD up to your main system as an extra (either external, or internal) drive?<br>I only ask b/c I once had a disk that I thought died, but ended up just being unbootable - I think the MBR or something got hosed. So I was able to hook it up to an external (USB2.0) case and read from the drive that way. Just a thought.<br>Oh, and Dugald - unfortunately I don't think a UPS for the build machine was in the budget... though if any one want to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?user_id=550140" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?user_id=550140">donate to the cause</a>, I'm sure we could look into getting one. :)</p>
