message: <p>surge protectors suck. they are worthless. i have a computer at my house plugged into the wall because i'm guessing that the plastic cover on the outlet will help the computer out.<br>i don't really care a whole lot about it. its just for my 3 year old son to just mess around on and play his mickey mouse game. if it goes... i have like 2 more pentium 2 computers in storage somewhere :)</p>
