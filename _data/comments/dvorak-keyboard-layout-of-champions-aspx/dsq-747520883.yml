message: '<p>When I decided to become an independent medical transcriptionist, I retrained in Dvorak, as preserving my wrists, forearms, elbows, etc., was/is very important to me.  I also have reset the language bar to Dvorak English.  It does freak people out.  On my laptop, I have also popped all the keys off and put them in their proper Dvorak locations. Now, I am doing some freelance transcription in an office, using their machines, and having trouble convincing anyone to do anything to their computer.  Imagine entering 50 email addresses, hunting and pecking.  Not good. I originally had a keyboard with a Dvorak/Qwerty button that I could use to switch between at the keyboard level and not remap.  Are there any more out there (I have tried one flat one that had the space, return, and #6 in weird locations, never could do that.) Have looked at the Kenisis keyboard . . does it really work well and comfortably?  Could it work on 2+ different computers?  Thanks so much, Anna</p>'
