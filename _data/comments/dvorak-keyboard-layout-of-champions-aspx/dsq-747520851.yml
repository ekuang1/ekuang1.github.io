message: "<p>Totally agree :-). I switched to Dvorak on a Qwerty keyboard and I'm sure I'm a better typist for it. However this is partly because I taught myself to touch type at the same time: previously, I had a (very fast) hunt-and-peck technique which was impossible to get rid of without going cold-turkey on Qwerty. <br>I can still switch between Dvorak and Qwerty modes of my brain by looking at the keyboard, but my hunt-and-peck has still fallen out of practice a little :-). It also, like you, only took me a couple of weeks to get up to a reasonable speed, so everyone should consider making this switch!</p>"
