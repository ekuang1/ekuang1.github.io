message: <p>I switched the same time as Phil - we were at the same company and we both had some free time on our hands, so to speak. But I didn't switch due to pain I was experiencing. <br>I switched because I'd seen several friends, including Phil, basically crippled from coding. I thought simply, "Hey I make my living with these hands of mine, better protect 'em!"<br></p>
