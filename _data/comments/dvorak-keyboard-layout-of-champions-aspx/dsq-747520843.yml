message: <p>I have long been tempted to try dvorak but how on earth can you use vi or emacs? The hjkl keys for vi navigation would no longer make sense. Would you have to change all of your apps to map those keys to whatever keys are the dvorak equivalents in the hjkl positions on the qwerty keyboard? I just don't get it.<br>My real dream is to learn something like a Datahand keyboard (<a href="http://www.datahand.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.datahand.com">www.datahand.com</a>) but the fact that they are the only company who makes this keyboard and it isn't a standard worries me about investing the time and money.</p>
