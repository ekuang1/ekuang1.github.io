message: "<p>Dvorak is great! I grew up typing 100+ wpm in Qwerty and retrained myself in 2007 mostly for fun, but also because I was convinced that doing so would allow me to type more easily and perhaps even faster than I was already. It took me roughly a month to have a basic fluency in Dvorak, although I didn't quit Qwerty \"cold turkey\" - I spent about an hour or so per day using Dvorak and trying to carry on my normal activities without switching to Qwerty. By the end of the month, I felt totally comfortable with Dvorak and was typing at least 50-60 wpm. I now type about 80-90 wpm in Dvorak, maybe 70-80 in Qwerty whenever I (rarely) need to use it. The thing that really sold me on Dvorak is that typing just feels so much BETTER! Every common letter combination like io, ie, ou, th, nth, mn, sn, sm, st, and so on and so forth, flows naturally from your fingertips in a way that you never noticed Qwerty didn't allow, and your finger action feels a lot more balanced between right and left. You can actually see it you watch somebody's (or your own) hands typing in Dvorak and then in Qwerty: there's a great deal more motion off of the home keys with Qwerty than there is with Dvorak. Practically every computer you'll sit down at these days has Dvorak support, so there's really no reason not to make the switch ;)</p>"
