message: "<p>i have switched to dvorak about 5 years ago i would estimate, and i have been really happy with it. except for one thing, i happen to be german. so there's no öüäß on dvorak, and when writing emails at work you cannot quite go substitute them.<br>then the only time i ever had any pain after typing was when i typed dvorak, but switched (left alt+shift) to qwertz (german qwerty) for one single letter at a time.<br>luckily someone eventually came up with the neo2 layout (the neo layout wasn't too bad, but i didn't want to switch because all the brackets were hard to reach) which imho is not far from the perfect layout. i have adopted that about 2 weeks after it came out, and they're still arguing about the placement of some keys.<br>now the problem i have is .... sometimes i hit the keys for qwerty, sometimes for dvorak, most of the time i hit the right keys. if only i could type on the neo2 layout everywhere i think i would be fine.<br>unfortunately i can't post a link because neo2 is not yet official.<br>this shows the neo layout: <a href=\"http://pebbles.schattenlauf.de/layout.php\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://pebbles.schattenlauf.de/layout.php\">http://pebbles.schattenlauf...</a> (scroll down to the bottom half)</p>"
