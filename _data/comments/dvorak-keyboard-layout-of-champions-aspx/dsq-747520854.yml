message: <p>I learned on a selectric, but my mother had a manual typewriter at home.  So I'm familiar with their operation.  I don't buy the argument that qwerty is designed to slow you down.<br>If it was... What was this mystical fast layout?  Where'd it go?  Dvorak came out sixty years after the invention of qwerty.<br>Why don't we use the old mystical layout which made you type too fast for the typewriter to keep up?<br>My suspicion is, the first layout was simple alphabetical order.</p>
