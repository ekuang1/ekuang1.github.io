message: <p>I'm not a coder, but I spend a lot of time surfing and depend on my hands for my occupation (electronics tech). I learned about Dvorak back in the 80's but never followed up on it until I started having pain in my hands a couple years ago. Just changing to Dvorak layout alleviated so much pain, it was almost unbelievable. <br>I took a $10 keyboard and moved the keycaps around, and put a drop of superglue on the U and H keys to home my index fingers on. Took me about 5 minutes, and it's been awesome. If it breaks, no biggie. I just pick up another $10 keyboard and do it again!<br>At least now I don't have to worry about my wife or son borking up my machine!</p>
