message: <p>have you ever thought about reformating the fonts on each key to the mirror image for those who suffer from a rare form of dyslexia called strephosymbolia, if not, check out both my website at <a href="http://wordpress.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> or the strepho-view keyboard @  <a href="http://www.arkayengravers.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.arkayengravers.com">www.arkayengravers.com</a>  &amp; keep in mind that i am living on the other side of the coin so to speak, prior to 1990 i was able to read &amp; write in what is considered the norm, from left to right. now my vision only allows me to precieve all print as if it were printed backwards in the mirror image, if anyone wishes to email me about the strepho-view keyboard <br>feel free  swaner1@cox.net  my computer allows me to send email back in standard format along with attachments after a reformat of the Dvorak<br>pattern.</p>
