message: <p>re vi usage. Just use the arrow keys for navigation. It's what I do. Requires moving over but...*shrug*<br>Now if only we could convince companies to make ergonomic dvorak keyboards that cost less than $100. I'm drooling over the Kinesis one but can't spare the cash for it so i have do deal with all the annoying issues that sprout from remapping a querty keyboard... like when you vnc into another computer that's also remapping...thus doubly remapping it. ugh.</p>
