message: I'm sceptic about this, improving my typing speed, i'll test it anyway. If i don't come back here, consider it good. 80% sure i'll be back here in a year, telling you that's futile, just take into consideration those middle way separated keyboards, what good would this do, on those? I got here, wondering why keyboards usually have qwerty... That got solved.
