message: <p>My typing skills are already sad enough. I really want to spend a couple of weeks on typing skills, but am not quite sold on DVORAK. The problem is I still have to use other workstations (ie the rest of the English-speaking world), and that I am a proponent of Pair programming. I'd give it about 3 days before a partner dumps rat poison in my mug.</p>
