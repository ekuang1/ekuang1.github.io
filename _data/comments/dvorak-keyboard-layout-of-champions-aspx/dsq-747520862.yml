message: "<p>Regarding the \"alternating hammers theory\", it's still a reason for the layout that's totally invalid today. The Dvorak layout's ultimate historical status isn't relevant either. What IS relevant is that that if someone, somewhere, through a massive amount of useability testing came up with a non-qwerty keyboard layout that accomplished all ergonomic- and speed-related goals, it wouldn't be generally adopted.<br>I've often thought of the qwerty layout like the english language: almost certainly not the choice people around the world would make if they sat down and thought about it, but most people don't feel they have the choice. The english language is consequently pervasive and invasive in ways the original speakers wouldn't have thought possible.</p>"
