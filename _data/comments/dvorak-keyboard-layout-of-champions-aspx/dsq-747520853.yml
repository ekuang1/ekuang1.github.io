message: <p>I went through the whole vi key remapping thing when I switched to Dvorak last year.  It works, but I recommend staying with the non-remapped version.  I've since switched back, and it's not as bad as you might think.  It may not seem as natural as the old hjkl layout, but it encourages you to get used to alternate movement techniques, which in turn increases your vi/vim efficiency.</p>
