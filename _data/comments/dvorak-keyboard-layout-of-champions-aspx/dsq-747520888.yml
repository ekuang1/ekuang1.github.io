message: <p>I started experiencing heavy carpal tunnel pains (which actually turned out to originate from a pinched nerve in my neck) so I switched to dvorak over 3 years ago.  I was working as a government contractor so I had nothing but time.  It took about 3 weeks before I could type with any degree of efficiency.  I'm sure I can type faster than when I used qwerty, but I never did any benchmarks.  It certainly feels more comfortable.  <br>I put stickers on my keyboard for use with ctrl/alt and so coworkers can hunt and peck if they need to type something on my keyboard.  I've got some from ebay, but I've also printed these (<a href="http://www.mwbrooks.com/dvorak/dvorcaps.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.mwbrooks.com/dvorak/dvorcaps.pdf">http://www.mwbrooks.com/dvorak/dvorcaps.pdf</a>) out on label stock, covered them with packaging tape and cut them out.<br>Long live dvorak!</p>
