message: <p>Something not mentioned is the "Dvorak Qwerty-command" option on the Mac. I really wish it was on the PC as well. Essentially it lets me type in dvorak, but all of my command key shortcuts (copy, paste, save, undo, print) use the qwerty keys. Doing this allows me to use these commands with one hand and doesn't make me feel stupid when trying to find the C key.</p>
