message: <p>It's not an urban myth that QWERTY was developed to keep typewriter hammers from jamming by keeping separate letters which are commonly concurrent. C.L. Sholes, the 1868 patent-holder for the "Type-Writer," supposedly developed QWERTY after much trial and error merely as an expedient - during testing it was the set-up that led to the fewest jams, and Sholes wanted to make money selling his invention. Typewriters that jammed constantly would cause too much frustration for early adopters. It was no more scientific than that.</p>
