message: <p>Thanks for the email exchange about Minimak (<a href="http://www.minimak.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.minimak.org/">http://www.minimak.org/</a>).  Hope I explained it to your satisfaction.<br>As I mentioned, it's not really meant for people who use Dvorak, so I think you might find it of intellectual interest but not much more.  For QWERTY typists though, you get a lot of what Dvorak has to offer without your QWERTY going down to 60% like yours did.  (60% really?  Mine went down to like 20% when I learned a new full-keyboard layout)</p>
