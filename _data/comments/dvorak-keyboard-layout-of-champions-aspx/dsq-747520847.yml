message: <p>Believe me, that Kinesis Ergo is worth every cent. I don't use mine as much as I used to because I have a laptop for my main work, and my hands remind me now to take a break in a way that they didn't when I was doing both. Using Dvorak on the Kinesis Ergo is how man was meant to type. I also have a thumb trackball from Logictech, which made less of a difference. The combined effect of the Ergo and the Dvorak layout cannot be overstated though.<br>As for vi/emacs, when I switched to the Ergo/Dvorak combo I also switched from vi to emacs, because the Kinesis puts the space-cadet keys in closer range than escape and also there's the direction key thing. Emacs is no problem on the Kinesis. Vi, I would hesitate to recommend, but in reality I've known people to go on using it with the Ergo. Switching either to Dvorak or to the Ergo is a great idea though, your hands will thank you -- probably sooner than you'd expect. And actually I use TextMate for everything these days.</p>
