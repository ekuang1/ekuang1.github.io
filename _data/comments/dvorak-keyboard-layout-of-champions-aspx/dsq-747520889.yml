message: <p>I switched to Dvorak about 10 years ago, and never looked back.<br>I also enjoy it when people try using my computer. Most people, however, get a disbelieving look when I give them the explanation. Some, who have heard of Dvorak, think its totally awesome that I am a Dvorakian.<br>The added bonus is, that once my co-devs know I use the Dvorak, they never try to use my machine again - I like my private space :)</p>
