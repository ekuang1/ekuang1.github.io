message: <p>QWERTY keyboards were not designed to slow you down. They were designed so that letters commonly typed in succession alternate between left and right hammers on the keyboard. Hammers coming too often from one side or the other of the keyboard increased the risk of them colliding. Alternating between left and right hammers mostly remedied this.</p>
