message: <p>Hi folks!  I've been using the Dvorak keyboard layout for about seven years now and it is absolutely the best thing that I have ever done for my personal ergonomics.  It is hard to argue with a 42% reduction in lateral finger motion.<br>I ran an experiment to try to discover an optimal keyboard layout using evolutionary algorithms that would produce mutated keyboard layouts and have them compete by simulating typing a giant corpus of English text and C.  All the winners from this exercise in natural selection had the five vowels on the home row under the left hand and most of DHTNS on the home row under the right.<br>At work, I have more or less stopped evangelizing Dvorak.  It's amazing how people argue that it can't possibly make a difference.  I've learned that if somebody really wants to hit themselves in the head with a hammer, telling them to stop is ineffective.  But it still drives me nuts to see people with weird "ergonomic" keyboard designs that still perpetuate QWERTY.  Really, Dvorak on a $10 keyboard is going to be so much better for you than QWERTY on a $300 toy.<br>Anyway, my point in writing to you all is to make sure that you Emacs/Vi users hear about my Dvorak-optimized text editor, aoeui.
