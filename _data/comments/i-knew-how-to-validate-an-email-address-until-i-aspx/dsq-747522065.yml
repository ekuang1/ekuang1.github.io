message: <p>So many here seem to forget that there is more to email validation that just wanting to correct user input... there is also the issue or parsing a list of emails (as just one example).  If I cannot reliably recognise/validate a single email address (including all special characters and quoting rules) how can I possibly parse a string that contains a list of addresses?</p>
