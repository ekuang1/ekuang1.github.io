message: <p>Back when the TLD for Anguilla was run out of a friend's bedroom in Berkeley, California, USA, there were a number of email addresses of the form name@ai, including n@ai (which belonged to Ian), and $@ai .  Since there are only about 10,000 people on the island, they could just about do name@ai for everybody there, except there are probably a few duplicate names.</p>
