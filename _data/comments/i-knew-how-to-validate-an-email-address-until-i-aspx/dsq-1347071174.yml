message: <p>Yes!  There are a number of systems that use user+tag@domain.tld or user-tag@domain.tld .  In both cases, "user" identifies the recipient, and "tag" can be arbitrary alphanumerics, typically used for sorting mail into mailboxes, or for providing different tagged addresses to each person who might send you mail, so that you can easily identify mail from useful senders or probable spammers.</p>
