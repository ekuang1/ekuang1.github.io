message: "<p>@David Hmm... I'm not so sure. The very first sentence of the last paragraph of RFC 2822 <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"RFC 2822 section 3.2.2\">3.2.2</a> states...<br></p><blockquote><p>Note: The \"\\\" character may appear in a message where it is not part of a quoted-pair.</p>&lt;/block&gt;<br>Not to mention the examples by the author of the SMTP RFC in RFC 3696 <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696#page-6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"Page 6 of RFC 3696\">RFC Page 6</a> shows that the \\ escaping happens outside of a double quoted string.<br>Note that he says...<br><blockquote><p>When quoting is needed, the backslash character is used to quote the following character.</p></blockquote><br>And goes on to say...<br><blockquote>In addition to quoting using the backslash character, conventional double-quote characters may be used to surround strings.</blockquote><br>This implies there are two different ways to <em>quote</em> characters. I think the term <em>quote</em> here is confusing and probably should be <em>escape</em>.<br>In any case, this only bolsters my point that reading a spec is difficult and all specs are ambiguous to the readers. ;)</blockquote>"
