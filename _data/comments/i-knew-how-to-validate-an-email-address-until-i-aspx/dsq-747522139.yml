I appreciate if you can help me out.<br>#! usr/bin/perl<br>$mail = \"abcdefgh@gmail.com\";<br>if ($mail =~ \"\\@\" ) {<br>print(\"my name = good!\");<br>}<br>else<br>{<br>print(\"my name = bad!\");<br>}<br><br>if ($mail =~ \"@\" ) will work only if  $mail = \"abcdefgh\\@gmail.com\";<br>but in my case, i will be getting the input with email address as its.<br>Not with an escape character.<br>Waiting for a solution from you...<br>Thanks,<br>Tom</p>"
