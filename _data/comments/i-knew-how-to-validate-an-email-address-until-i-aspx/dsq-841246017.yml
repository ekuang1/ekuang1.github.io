message: <p>And for the love of $DEITY,  NEVER reject an email address because you can't find an 'A' record.  I use a whole bunch of perfectly valid email addresses on perfectly valid email-only domains which have only 'MX' records and no 'A' records.  The number of times my email addresses are rejected by broken "validators" is .. annoying, to say the least.</p>
