message: <p>I definitely agree they are hard to interpret. I've fixed bugs related to them on a fairly large email system.<br>I'm not sure the specs are ambiguous in this case, though. The next sentence of section 3.2.2 says:<br></p><blockquote><br>   A "\" character that does not appear in a<br>   quoted-pair is not semantically invisible.  The only places in this<br>   standard where quoted-pair currently appears are ccontent, qcontent,<br>   dcontent, no-fold-quote, and no-fold-literal.<br></blockquote><p><br>"not semantically invisible" meaning that it is not interpreted with any special meaning and is displayed as is.<br>Also the reason I picked up on it is the original email RFC <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822#section-3.4.1" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822#section-3.4.1">categorically states</a> that it must be within double quotes. If anything I'd say it's a mistake in RFC 3696 (which is only an informative RFC, so is likely to have had less scrutiny than a standards track one).</p>
