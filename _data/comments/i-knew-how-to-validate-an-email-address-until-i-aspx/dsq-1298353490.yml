message: "<p>I hate the back teeth out of stupid forms making anybody repeating anything that is not a password (ie., only ever displayed as asterisks).</p><p>I have written 'spamyourselves@yourstupiddomain.tld' twice into plenty of forms being hosted by websites that would not have come to my attention without spamming me or someone I know - not even signing up, just leaving a message telling them exactly how clever I thought their marketing departments were.</p><p>Let us enter our email address once and do nothing more (with us) until we have confirmed our ability to access emails sent to that address - prompt us perhaps, onsubmit, to review our email address (in a huge font, make it blink if you think that is clever) and confirm that we are happy with what we entered with yet another click but even expecting me to copy and paste my first response into the second box is asking too much at times - I have foregone posting/joining on plenty of occasions where the importance of passing on my opinion was outweighed by my hatred and sheer loathing of the idea of entering something that isn't a password (being set or reset, no less) twice.</p><p>So far the box below is offering me to post as a guest and only asking me to type my email address once, I hope it isn't just setting me up...</p><p>Note for admin: If you read the email address I am using and wonder if it is valid and reachable I urge you to send me a confirmation email :)</p>"
