message: <p>This is an excellent work, and it is very clearly and very honestly presented. Thanks much!<br>In my experience (our typical client is frankly non-geek), an email address which looks weird - and that would be accepted by a thoroughly RFC-compliant algorithm - is actually a typo.<br>Ideally, what we would need would be an algorithm designed to exclude typos.<br>For instance, our algorithm rejects addresses ending with @homail.com...<br>(in France, we have a big ISP named <a href="http://wanadoo.fr" rel="nofollow noopener" title="wanadoo.fr">wanadoo.fr</a> - 10% of our users spell it <a href="http://wanado.fr" rel="nofollow noopener" title="wanado.fr">wanado.fr</a>, or <a href="http://wabadoo.fr" rel="nofollow noopener" title="wabadoo.fr">wabadoo.fr</a> or <a href="http://wannadoo.fr" rel="nofollow noopener" title="wannadoo.fr">wannadoo.fr</a> or various sometimes exhilarating variations)</p>
