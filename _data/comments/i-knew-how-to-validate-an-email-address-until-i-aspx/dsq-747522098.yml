message: '<p>I knew that one already. Several years ago I did not, though. But it would not be a problem for me since my way of doing is "do it as the specification says".<br>Another thing that might be interesting for you is ISO-8601. I found that people doeas not know the INTERNATIONAL data/time/etc. format.<br>If you see a date 01/02/03 or 01-02-03 or 01.02.03 or 123456 or .... what date is it ?!? Silly american format where less significant units (months) are first and most significant (years) last? or maybe stupid date format used in for example Poland: DD.MM.YYYY (sometime YY is used for year)?<br>Just in a brief:<br>1) Use always YYYY-MM-DD (YYYYMMDD if you cannot use dashes)<br>2) Never use YYYYMM or YYMMDD<br>3) If possible, try using YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH:MM:SS<br>Some point for you to consider:<br>- When date is sorted from-most-significant-to-least then it is the same as numbers (most significant digit on the left) for "commonly used number systems".<br>- When date is sorted from-most-significant-to-least then you can sort it alphabetically - it would be the same as by date.<br>- This is an international form. A standard. Use it.<br>- Having thousands of date formats makes it easy to misunderstand dates.</p>'
