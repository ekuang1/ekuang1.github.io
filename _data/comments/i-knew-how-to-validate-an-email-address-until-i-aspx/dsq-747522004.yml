message: <p>@Jeff  I agree with your points, but would point out that these are not mutually exclusive points of validation. I think in general there are several levels of validation.<br>I don't want to try and send you a verification link (as is common) if I already know your email is a fake. Hence when collecting emails, I would do a fairly liberal email validation (for example, make sure there is an @ character). As you point out, this can be beneficial to the user experience to help prevent typos.<br>What would be really bad for user experience is too strict validation where you reject a perfectly valid email that really does belong to the user.<br><br></p>
