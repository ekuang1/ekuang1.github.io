message: <p>I've been using a regex that basically checks for at least one non-whitespace char before the @ sign, another one after, a dot and then another two.<br>Looks like you haven't touched on the international UTF-8 symbols and accented characters that are recommended to be valid (a later RFC perhaps - I think I saw it in the IETF DRUMS 08 on SMTP)</p>
