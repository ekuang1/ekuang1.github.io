message: <p>Sadly, almost none of these combinations works in Hotmail!<br>It's supposed they should follow the standards, but if you want to send an email to abc!def@somethig.tld is not possible... so, if you have a friend with a valid account that uses a ! in his email, you cannot send him emails using hotmail... :S<br>I tested other valid combinations, and none of them seems to be valid by Hotmail... <br>They're all valid in Gmail and Yahoo, and other email servers. I don't understand why Hotmail it's always the exception....<br></p>
