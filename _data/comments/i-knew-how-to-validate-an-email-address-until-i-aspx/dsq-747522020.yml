message: <p>Phil, I think users would prefer to have to enter their email address twice (they can copy+paste - at least it makes them look at what they typed) if it means they avoid typos and therefore aren't sitting wondering why they're not getting messages - or, worse, that their messages are going to someone else (which is highly possible if they're on a popular webmail service).<br></p>
