message: <p>Yes, please get the word out. Do you know how many sites refuse my email address because it has a + sign in it? It's very frustrating...<br>The best compromise I've seen so far is to have it complain if you use a "weird" character, but then offer you a chance to say "no, that *really* is my email address". That way it catches stupid mistakes, but lets you have the final say as to whether it's valid or not.<br>-David</p>
