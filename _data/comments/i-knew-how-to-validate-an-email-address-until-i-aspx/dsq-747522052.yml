message: <p>the '+' character in E-mail addresses is a vital necessity.  Its useful for filtering emails and finding out who's selling your address and probably has 100 other uses.<br>A previous commenter mentioned GMAIL as having the 'auto-tagging' feature by adding ++yourtaghere at the end of your username within your email address.<br>For example, johndoe++haacked@gmail.com.  This will automatically goto johndoe@gmail.com.<br>In addition to this johndoe+haacked@gmail.com will also be sent to johndoe@gmail.com.  However; the single + sign is built into almost all mail servers.  I know it works with my company's Exchange server, Gmail, Yahoo, my local cable company's E-mail server and I'm sure most any web mail provider allows this.  I've written about the <a href="http://randyandrachel.com/2007/03/10/when-eating-an-elephant-take-one-bite-at-a-time/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://randyandrachel.com/2007/03/10/when-eating-an-elephant-take-one-bite-at-a-time/">+ operator in your email address</a> in the past.  However I get very frustrated with websites which don't allow it as I'm sure yours is about to do...</p>
