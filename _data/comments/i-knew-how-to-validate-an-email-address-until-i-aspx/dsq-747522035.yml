message: "<p>First: Your blog software fails at validating my email address.  The only strange character in it is a plus (+).<br>That leads me to my first real point.  You said \"I think I’ll sign up for an email address like phil.h\\@\\@ck@haacked.com and start bitching at sites that require emails but don’t let me create an account with this new email address. Ooooooh I’m such a troublemaker.\"  Guess what?  You'll get plenty of bitching in if you just use plus addresses.  Your SMTP server probably copes with them out of the box.  Some asshole's validation software probably doesn't.<br>I've been on that path for a few years.  Out of hundreds of complaints, guess what I've gotten?  A large number of no response, a large (but smaller) number of indignant \"that doesn't work!  Fix your address!\", some \"wow, that's strange.  Oh well, our software doesn't cope.\", and a single digit number of \"hey!  I'll fix that to make my software correct!\".  It's not a fun passtime.<br>Second, here's the regex I use to validate email addresses: .+@[^@]+\\.[^@]+<br>Looks simplistic?  It works ok.  It's not actually correct, as it doesn't take local addresses correctly (me@foo is valid, assuming there's a machine named foo around).  That's ok, it's a strange edge case.<br>The real test, of course, is handing the address off to my SMTP server and seeing if you get the email.  If you do, congratulations, it's a real address.  If not, guess it wasn't.  You're verifying those addresses first, right?</p>"
