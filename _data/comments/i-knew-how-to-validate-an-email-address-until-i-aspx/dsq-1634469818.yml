message: <p>7 years later and this is still an issue that most people don't want to touch. With e-mail providers supporting characters like '+' in e-mail addresses, you'd think people would step up their validation.. But nope. The number of sites I can't use e-mail addresses containing plus signs on is pretty large, and consequently pretty annoying.</p>
