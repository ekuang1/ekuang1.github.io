message: <p>@Rik I can copy and paste with my eyes closed. It's an automatic action, like driving to work. Sometimes I drive to work when I mean to drive somewhere else. In other words, I don't think it helps really.<br>Even so, even with requiring a user enter their email twice, why wouldn't you do some simple validation. At the very least make sure there is an @ sign.</p>
