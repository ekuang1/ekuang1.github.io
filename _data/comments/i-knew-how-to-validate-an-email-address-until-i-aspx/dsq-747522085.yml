message: "<p>(sigh) I must be showing my age...guess I can't get a job anymore.<br>FizzBuzz solution (proven at runtime to be correct) written in python:<br>for myCounter in range(1,100):<br>    if (myCounter % 3) == 0 or (myCounter % 5) == 0:<br>        if (myCounter % 3) == 0:<br>            print \"fizz\"<br>        if (myCounter % 5) == 0:<br>            print \"buzz\"<br>        if ((myCounter % 3) == 0) and ((myCounter % 5) == 0):<br>            print \"fizzbuzz\"<br>    else:<br>        print myCounter<br>        <br>Total time to write it: about 7 minutes (5 minutes initial, 2 more to remove a stupid format problem in the program that printed a space).<br>Like I said, it's proven at runtime.  I've already observed the output and it is correct.  If you think it isn't, go back and re-read the damn request.  It's simple.  fizz at 3s, buzz at 5s, fizzbuzz at 3s and 5s, number otherwise.<br>Jesus on a f'n pogo stick, if a mediocre programmer like myself can write it, then what the hell are the other \"expert programmers\" doing?  And I can't get a job elsewhere?  What the hell?<br></p>"
