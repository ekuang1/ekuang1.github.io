message: <p>Ok, I finally corrected the post to fix my misinterpretation.<br>Regarding international characters, I know that IRI (International Resourec Identifier) can be mapped to URI by hex encoding using the %HH sequence of bytes. I'm not well versed in this though. And yes, my regex does not take that into consideration at all.<br>Check out the perl regex linked to by other commenters. I wonder if that does. ;)</p>
