message: <p>I think you missed my point completely. I'm not in the least bit offended by either. My point was that there was no reason to back-off and feel like you were offending someone just by pointing out something that was truly said. I think you were afraid of letting it stand on its own.<br><br><br><br>You're quite right that humor is very important. I just think that my sense of humor is capable of understanding that all Muslims are not evil without having been to be told so.<br><br><br><br>James points out the obvious point that not all Muslims are extremists. You respond by updating your entry to point this out and make sure to add an analogous (but fictional) story about a Christian extremist. When someone (me) points this out to you, your response is to tell me not to be offended. Do you see where you went wrong here? You should have give the exact response that you gave me to James in the first place.<br><br><br><br>We shouldn't treat ourselves like children and bend over backwards so as not to offend anyone. That was what I thought was silly.<br><br></p>
