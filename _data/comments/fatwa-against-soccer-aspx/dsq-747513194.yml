message: <p>Hi James,<br><br><br><br>I changed the wording of the post to highlight the fact that these are the words of an extremist and not the general Muslim population.  <br><br><br><br>I find it humorous because of my love of soccer, not because of the particular faith of the one issuing the edict.  As the article points out, the point of publicizing this list is to highlight the absurdity of the extremists and to promote the more common views of Islam.<br><br><br><br>So I mean no ill will to the Muslim community.  In case this is still deemed offensive, I added some Christian soccer rules to make sure I piss off both sides of the religious divide.</p>
