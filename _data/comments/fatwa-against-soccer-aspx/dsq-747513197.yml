message: <p>Silly? Of course.<br><br><br><br>Walter gets the point above. The point of adding my extremist "Christian" rules was not to appease potentially offended Muslims, it was to highlight the absurdity of applying any sort of religious "law" too stringently to other institutions (namely Soccer).<br><br><br><br>If you choose to be offended by that, I suggest you grow a sense of humor because life can be quite unbearable without it.</p>
