message: <p>Hello Phil, my name is Wessam Zeidan. I'm a Microsoft ASP.NET MVP....and I'm a Muslim. I've read your post, and I've read the article on Herald Tribune, and I want to share what I felt after reading those...Honestly.....I cracked up laughing :D...I seriously think its some kind of joke, and if these fatwas where really true, then the person who made them up was either drunk, or he's a big fan of basketball and wants his soccer loving friends to dump soccer and switch to basketball....loooool<br><br><br><br>As I said, I'm a Muslim, and I'm a big soccer fan...I love watching soccer and playing soccer (but with all the new cool features of <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> 2.0, I'm finding it so hard to leave my laptop to do any thing else :P).....These extremists are misleading people, by hiding the true Islam and making up a version of their own.......</p>
