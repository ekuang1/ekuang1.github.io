message: <p>I sent this to Phil, because I know he enjoys soccer.  As a Christian, I choose not to be offended by his "Christian" rules.  For example, it is (hopefully) clear that applying the verse in Timothy (that Phil has taken out of context) to a refuree is absurd.  This comparison highlights the absurdity of the Fatwa by analogy.  Phil never indicated that the Fatwa was representative of Islamic teachings.  He left it to his intelligent readers to figure that out.<br><br><br><br>As you can see, the article was included in the Opinions section of the Herald Tribune (and the New York Times I might add).  Those offended by Phil's post can exercise their right to free speach by objecting with a comment, but I suggest that they also write a letter to the editor of those papers.  Does James think that the New York Times should retract its editorial? <br><br><br><br>I don't think that potentially sensitive subjects should be off limits or ignored, and I think that humor helps us to make sense of a world that is becoming more and more difficult to understand (Chris Rock and the Daily Show are but two great examples).</p>
