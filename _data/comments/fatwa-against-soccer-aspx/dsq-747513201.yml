message: <p>Ah!  I absolutely did miss your point.  My apologies.<br><br><br><br>I actually thought you were James.  I agree that we all shouldn't have to bend over backwards trying not to offend each other.  <br><br><br><br>But I also want to be sensitive to certain realities. For example, there has been an undeserved backlash against Muslims in America, where many ignorant folks assume that ALL Muslims are associated with terrorists.  This is obviously far from the truth in the same way we know that not all white people are redneck terrorists despite the example of Timothy McVeigh.<br><br><br><br>Whether intentional or not, I do not want to fuel such prejudices.  So I took a step back.  It's was my choice.<br><br><br><br>As for adding the fictional Christian rules, that was to take a potshot at my friend Walter. I enjoy busting his chops, but he's a bigger man than me, pointing out theological ways I could have even been funnier.<br><br><br><br></p>
