message: <p>At Univ we worked with Scheme (a functional programming language). After a few months the programs became more and more complex. I don't know if it was because Visual Studio just beats all other IDE's out of the park , but I never found it easy to keep more complex code readable. I always ended up spending way more time to get something usefull running then I could do so in C#.<br>Maybe I should have a look at F# some day to see what a functional language is like in a real IDE.</p>
