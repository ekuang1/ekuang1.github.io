message: <p>In this case at least you can do this just as succinctly, and maybe more understandably with imperative code:<br><code><br>foreach (string format in suffixFormats)<br>{<br>string slug = originalSlug + String.Format(s, separator);<br>if (Repository.GetEntry(slug) == null)<br>return slug;<br>}<br>throw new InvalidOperationException("couldn't auto generate slug");<br></code><br>I never use Linq expressions when imperative code functions just as well. Why make the code more complicated and have possible unknown overhead calling into Linq?</p>
