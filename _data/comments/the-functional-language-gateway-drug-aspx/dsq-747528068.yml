message: <p>This probably isn't why you wrote this post but I would just like to say that it is probably advisable to have more than just six variations for your "slugs". For example, the pharyangula blog regularly has a blog post entitied "I get emails", where he features some crazy emails he received recently. So it's totally reasonable to have many posts with the same title.</p>
