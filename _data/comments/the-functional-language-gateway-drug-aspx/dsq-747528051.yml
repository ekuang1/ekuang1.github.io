message: "<p>Hi Phil,<br>I think that functional programming really rocks!<br>For example, in your first implementation using imperative programming you have 30 lines of code. With the second and more fluent functional programming implementation you have only 9 lines of code, that is, 1/3 of code reduction.<br>To me the second implementation is far better to understand! As you said: it reads how I think about the problem. This is the point.<br>Yeah, C# with LINQ is being transformed in a good functional gateway drug. :)<br>I'm an old reader of your blog. It's a great source of information.<br>Keep up the great work.<br>Leniel Macaferi</p>"
