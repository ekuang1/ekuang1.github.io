message: <p>Not relevant to the functional programming issue, but in the case of post slugs why not simply add numbers? Sure, nobody is likely to do more than 6 "Hello World" posts, but there are plenty of people who like to post around "Weekly Review", "Monthly update", "Happy Birthday to Me", etc, etc. <br>Now, it may be nicer to stick full dates into the title of those posts, but why force people to do so if they don't want to?</p>
