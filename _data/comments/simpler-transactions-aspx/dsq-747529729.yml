message: <p>Funny you bring this up.  I was working with TransactionScope the other day and had forgotten to Complete() it.  You'd have save'd me some headaches there :).<br>While I like the creative aspect of shortcutting the process I find the original implementation easier to read and therefore easier to maintain.</p>
