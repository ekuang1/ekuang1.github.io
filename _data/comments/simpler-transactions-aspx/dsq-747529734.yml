message: <p>Personally, I would not use it. I wrap the transaction in a unit of work. For 99% of the cases, I start a transaction on the begin of a webrequest, and commit it at the end. <br>With the implementation you use, you have to manage the transaction all over the application, everywhere where data-access is used. In a typical application, just one (or two or three) places are enough.</p>
