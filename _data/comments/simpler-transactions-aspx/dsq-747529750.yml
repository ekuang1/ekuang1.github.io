message: <p>I always forget to commit transactions, and since I've been doing it for 14 years, I think this makes for great discussion!<br>The <code>using</code> pattern is great for enforcing safe disposal or resources, but I suspect it's orthogonal to transaction commit/rollback? <br>With that out of the picture, then I personally prefer to fall back on the <em>rule of least surprise</em>. For me, I always like code to read in such a way that it prioritises the best-case-scenario. This means that ransactions should commit by default. <br>In SQL Server Managment Studio this is the default setting - you execute SQL and it automatically commits. On the other hand, last time I used Oracle SQL tools, you had to explicitly commit your work.<br>So, for some developers, transactions should rollback by default. For other developers, transactions should complete by default. It's cultural.<br>The explicitness of <code>transaction.Complete()</code> is great when there is no standard way of doing things. And I think there is no standard way of doing things. So, I say we need to be  explicit and write <code>transaction.Complete()</code> in our code, rather than relying in a convention. <br><br></p>
