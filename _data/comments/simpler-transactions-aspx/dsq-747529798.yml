message: <p>Why do people feel the need to abstract things that don't need abstracting? For 3 lines of code, and you have intellisense, is it really that hard? Think of the poor shmuck (typically me) that has to come in and maintain/fix it...<br>If you want to save space, then stop using braces for one line IF statements. At least I can easily understand. :-P<br>(I actually do like the blog, good info even if a little abstract.)</p>
