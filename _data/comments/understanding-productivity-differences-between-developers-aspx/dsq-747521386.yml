message: "<p>Great post! This is the first time I've seen someone describe the problem in language that hiring managers can/will understand. I am going to keep this bookmarked so I have some good ammo the next time I need to make this argument for hiring quality developers, even if they are more expensive.<br>I think the unmeasured benefit of hiring great programmers may possibly exceed the ratios mentioned above. Great developers can also increase productivity by an amazing degree by bringing up the productivity of people around them: by troubleshooting tough problems when other developers are stuck, by spreading good development practices (like test-driven development, for example), and by helping management determine which features cost too much and deliver too little value to be worth implementing (saving what would otherwise be sunk cost and lost oppertunity cost brought about by not always working on the highest-value features).</p>"
