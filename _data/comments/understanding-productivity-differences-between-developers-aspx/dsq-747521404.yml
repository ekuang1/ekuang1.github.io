message: <p>This article is written from observational point of view.If one comes closer to the real life which means the participant point of view one will see that the real life is more relative.Everything in this article is distributed in absolute values.All the good stuff goes to the imaginery and abstract 'good developer' and then all the bad stuff is put under the so impersonalized 'not effective developer'.The life without those absolute-value glasses is far more relative which comes to tell that the distribution of bad and good features in a developer is not so one-sided and limited and often is more complex and that is the thing which makes the team oriented environment a reality.</p>
