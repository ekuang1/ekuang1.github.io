message: <p>Thanks for the great article.<br>In my long career, I had my fair deal of very good and very bad developers. I can vouch that the best of the lot are more then 28 times effective than the poor lot.<br>Some of the common traits that I observed include:<br>Extreme passion for what they do.<br>They reach a level of trance, they get so engrossed doing their work that nothing on the side bothers them.<br>Its more of an attitude,temperament or personal motivational. Rather than having an extra qualification.<br>Regards<br><br></p>
