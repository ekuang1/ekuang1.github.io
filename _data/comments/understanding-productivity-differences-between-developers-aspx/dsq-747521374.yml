message: "<p>Striddy, I agree that 28 times might seems a huge diff, but also consider that a dev in very few cases enters a company as the superstar, so I'd say odds are the same for any dev in a company of becoming the \"superstar\" or be being empowered. <br>Also, I don't believe grabbing the person/stakeholder is a right only to \"superstar\" devs, is a practice that any dev can and must do most of the time and also is a matter of interpersonal skills to achieve it in difficult scenarios. Another skill of good devs, IMO is just that, being able to translate tech doubts into plain english and being able to comunicate properly with other techies and non-techies.<br>Who hasn't heard the: <i>\"I like it when X explains things to me, I always understand him, I don't know how X does it.\"</i> at least 27 times a day ;)</p>"
