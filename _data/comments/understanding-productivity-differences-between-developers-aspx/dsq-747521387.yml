message: <p>I agree - but one issue good developers need to keep in mind is that their code must be maintainable by other developers. Great developers need to be fast but also develop frameworks and documentation for others to follow.<br>I've seen too many fast/guru developers build up lots of code, then leave the company w/o enough knowledge passed on to the other developers. So the company gets its 10x but then loses a lot of time and possibly spends lots of money before development can resume at a reasonable pace.</p>
