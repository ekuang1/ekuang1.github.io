message: <p>A very good eye opener for dev's and managers, well if the company wants programmers to be better for their values, they must be fare to them tell them their problems, and train them, productivity will increase, sense of ownership will be knocked in, Not necessary that all the slow ones will become supers but there will be a definate change. Why re-invent the wheel, you can never be sure of what you will get. Fire those 9 others and hire 9 more to find eight still need to be fired. Train those 9 and get a better productivity and people who want to stay with you for good.<br>Peace.</p>
