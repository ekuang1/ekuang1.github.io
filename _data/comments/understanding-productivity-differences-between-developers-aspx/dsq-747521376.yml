message: "<p>Excellent points all, but I don't think that's all there is to it. I think some developers really do write an incredible amount of good code in a short time. I've certainly seen some reported accomplishments by individual developers that astounded me.<br>Obviously that means I'm not one of the most elite developers, at least not yet. But I'm working on getting as close as I'm able.<br>At the moment I'm learning Emacs and Vim. Here's the article that got me started on that: <a href=\"http://derekslager.com/blog/posts/2006/12/the-case-for-emacs.ashx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://derekslager.com/blog/posts/2006/12/the-case-for-emacs.ashx\">http://derekslager.com/blog...</a><br>By speeding up my editing, making anything I need to do almost automatic, I hope to spend more time in a state of flow (see the book by that name by Csikszentmihalyi)...on days when I'm there, I amaze myself by what I get done. Boring, repetitive work kicks me right out of it. <br>Along similar lines, I'm spending more and more time writing code to generate code, instead of writing the final code directly. It takes deeper thinking up front, but then I can hit a button and all the boring stuff happens instantly, and bug-free if I've written the generator right.<br>Sometimes, I convert my generator, which is like a compiler, to an interpreter, and get an extremely flexible, concise little program to do everything I need. I've had some huge wins that way. Of course, this fits in your \"writing less code that does more\" category.<br>To get better at this sort of thing, I'm studying compiler and interpreter implementation. The more I read about programming, the more I'm convinced that building your own compiler is the programming equivalent of building your own lightsaber - you're not truly a jedi until you've done it. Here's a good article by Steve Yegge that argues the same thing: <a href=\"http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html\">http://steve-yegge.blogspot...</a><br>Beyond that...limiting interruptions by giving the non-programmers around me the tools they need to get things done without bothering me...and lately I'm exploring neurofeedback as a way to improve my access to that flow state. Seems to be useful so far.</p>"
