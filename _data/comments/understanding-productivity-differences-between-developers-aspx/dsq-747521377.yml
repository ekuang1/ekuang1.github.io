message: <p>@Striddy - that's what I mean by the total cost of ownership. Part of the reason a good developer is more productive overall is that a poor developer drags down the productivity of others.<br>For example, in the scenario I mentioned. 2 weeks (aka 80 dev hours) went by, nothing got accomplished. Whereas had he come to me to get help, maybe taking an hour of my time, it might have taken 81 dev hours (his 80 + my 1) but the project would be complete. A huge boost in productivity.<br>Productivity is not working every hour at some mad pace. It's being effective, not just efficient.</p>
