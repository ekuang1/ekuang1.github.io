message: <p>A better abbreviation for TCO is Total Cost of Outcome.  Businesses are really interested in the Outcome and as you point out "ownership" only confuses the matter.</p><p>I've worked on projects where I would sit down and think about a problem for 4 hours and then realize I could write a single line of code to solve the problem.  Meanwhile, I know other developers who would jump straight in and spend days hacking the solution into a complete disaster.  If you worked just on perception, some would argue I was doing nothing, when in reality I was developing a well considered solution.</p><p>I've also spent days trying to sift through badly written code, only to give up and entirely rewrite a project in 4 hours.</p><p>  Thankfully, I've worked with top companies that recognize and appreciate this difference.  You get what you pay for.  Pay peanuts, get monkeys.</p><p>This reminds of another myth called the "asian work ethic".  Being seen to do work and actually doing work are very different things.  Working in Singapore I would see people put in 12-14 hour days but produce very little.  Just because you're sitting in front a computer tapping keys doesn't mean you're achieving something.</p><p>Outcomes are the only things that matter.</p>
