message: <p>Excellent post.  I am referring to this every time I apply for a job or try and justify my pay :)...<br>There is also something that a lot of people overlook.  How about the a$$h0le developer that is rude to everyone and is impossible to work with?  What do you do in this case?  He is an amazing developer and a superstar but his attitude destroys the entire team's morale and makes it impossible for anyone to like their job i.e. he ends up reducing everyone's productivity...<br>So if he is 28x the rest but ends up reducing the morale of the entire team (made of 5 average developers) and hence reducing their productivity from 14x to 1x then the company's net productivity is a loss...<br>So, managers, keep that in mind when hiring and firing...  It's not just about the code and the engineering abilities.  Personal skills are extremely important and overlooked by many.</p>
