message: <p>I don't doubt that the productivity disparity is real; I've seen it often enough to know first-hand. However, I have to wonder if sometimes the magnitude of the effect is skewed by the way those superdevs work and how their mere mortal colleagues are treated. Numbers like 28x stretch credulity if chalked up only to individual abilities. I think often the greater ability is recognized and magnified by the organization, be it de facto or overt.<br>Take your example of going and grabbing the person who can help you get unstuck. If you're the superstar dev, that's tolerated and probably encouraged. If you're not, maybe not so much. Further, being the superstar generally garners a degree of freedom of action or &lt;cough&gt; empowerment, further magnifying the measured disparity in performance vs. those who are more bogged down in process and for whom every concession is hard-won.</p>
