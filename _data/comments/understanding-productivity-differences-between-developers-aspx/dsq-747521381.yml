message: <p>If I've ever been 28 times more productive, it's been when someone says there's a problem, they explain what is happening and I say "Go look here."<br>I'm amazed at the number of developers I encounter who don't understand how to troubleshoot.<br>I had one guy working for me who rolled back all changes he made the day before because his tests wouldn't run in the morning.  It turned out someone had truncated a table out of the database.  But he didn't even look to see what the error message was before leaping to this conclusion.</p>
