message: <p>"Along similar lines, I'm spending more and more time writing code to generate code, instead of writing the final code directly. It takes deeper thinking up front, but then I can hit a button and all the boring stuff happens instantly, and bug-free if I've written the generator right."<br>I've been on this path myself.  Compiler techniques lead to being able to perform static analysis on legacy code bases. I built a system that diagrams a legacy system and allows me to add my notes to the diagram as I go thru it.  Quick comprehension of systems is real 'force multiplier'.  May have commercial value.</p>
