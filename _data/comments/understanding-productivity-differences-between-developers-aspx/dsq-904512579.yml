message: <p>Great article. Under Good Developers Do More With Less Code, you say "the NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome is a pathological productivity killer" but then go onto explain an example where someone created an existing framework. Should this be AIH (Always Invented Here)? Or am I missing something?</p>
