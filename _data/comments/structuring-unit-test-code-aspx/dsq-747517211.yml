message: "<p>Jamie:  That's awesome.  TDD.NET never ceases to amaze me.<br>Phil:  You should REALLY separate your unit tests from integration tests, because as your projects grow you'll have a very large number of tests.<br>Unit tests run very quickly, because they are usually testing in-memory behavior, however integration tests likely talk to other systems (like a database) and are inherently slow.<br>You want your developers to run their tests regularly, but this will be less likely if it takes 45 seconds (or more) to run the test suite (and this number is likely to skyrocket as the project gets more complex).   Unit tests should be run regularly (like with every build on a dev box)  Integration tests should be automated on a build machine, and run upon-need on a dev box.<br>My 2nd comment is the naming.  Your recommendation above breaks good namespacing guidelines.<br>You should structure it like SubText.UnitTests.dll, so that it is obvious that \"SubText\" owns that namespace.<br>I've seen NAnt scripts that build app code into /src/app and test code into /src/test, so you'd still achieve separation.<br>just a though...</p>"
