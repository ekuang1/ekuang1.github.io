message: <p>Regarding the namespaces, it definitely is a matter of preference. I like having my unit tests sort to the bottom, but that's just an idiosyncracy. I guess I could break with conventions and use standard namespaces, but name the assembly in a different manner.<br>Though that also rubs me the wrong way. ;)</p>
