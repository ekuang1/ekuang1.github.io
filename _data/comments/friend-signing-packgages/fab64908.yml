message: Thawte had this social thing going on some 10 years ago - unfortunately that didn't fly. What I did like was the aspect of offline verification of users and you would gain "reputation" by just the count of offline validations done and by how reliable those validators are (their reputation did count in as well). Online stuff is way too easy to forge - we need IRL validations..
