  As Bradley suggests, it may be possible for NuGet accounts to just appear as another proof integration inside Keybase. In the other direction the NuGet command line could automate the Keybase command line to make use of Keybase assertions/proofs/follows. (https://keybase.io/docs/command_line) Or go further and try to work more directly with the merkle tree/sigchain.



  Though there are questions about relying on Keybase for such infrastructure. Keybase has seemed trustworthy so far, but they are still a for-profit company with a murky business plan and questionable revenue streams.
