message: "> Keybase has seemed trustworthy so far, but they are still a for-profit company with a murky business plan and questionable revenue streams.\r\n\r\nYeah, this is a good point. I don't know much about the company itself. Before building key software infrastructure that depended on them, I'd probably have talks with the company to find out what they're about. One thing to note, they are backed by [the same investors that were the first to fund GitHub](https://keybase.io/blog/2015-07-15/keybase-raises-series-a)\r\n\r\nThe good news is that Keybase itself is open source. If they didn't last, a company like Microsoft or GitHub could take the code and set something up itself."
