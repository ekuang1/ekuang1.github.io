message: <p>Phil,<br><br><br><br>CopySourceAsHtml only adds commands to the "Code Window" context menu.  If you want to copy ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, XML, etc, you have to add the commands to your menus or toolbars through Tools &gt; Customize... &gt; Commands &gt; Addins.

I just need to decide which context menus are relevant, and what their names are.<br><br><br><br>Colin</p>
