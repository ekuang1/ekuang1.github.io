message: <p>it would be nice, but would also have to support Atom 0.3 and 1.0. there is <a href="http://atom.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="atom.net">atom.net</a>, but that only supports atom 0.3. i was playing with the windows feed API, which works well, but if you need to use it on a server, you have to have IE7 installed...</p>
