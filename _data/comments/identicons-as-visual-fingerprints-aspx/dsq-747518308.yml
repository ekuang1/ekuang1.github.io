message: <p>...Of course, this is presupposing that someone doesn't access the same blog from two computers-- say a work and a home.  But, yes, this at least theoretically could help maintain culpability should someone try to disavow a comment they posted which was in fact from their computer... but I could easily go to my roommates and post something else offensive/immoral from my roommates computer and then accuse someone else of posting it...</p>
