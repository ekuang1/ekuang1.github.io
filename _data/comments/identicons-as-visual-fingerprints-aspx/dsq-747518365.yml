message: "<p>@.: I'm sure I don't like it.<br>There is an existing table that converts MD5 back into IP v4 address (turned up in Google).  Even barring that, it would be computationally trivial to make one.<br>Even without that though, the MD5 hash of the IP address is the same on every site.  And so it appears in the text that is indexed by Google on every site.  and so a search for it ought to turn up the same information as if the IP address were posted unobfuscated by all those sites.<br>Even if you added a layer of redirection, images are often normalized in indexes now.  Color Lookups are flattened and sorted, and then pixel data are compared -- not just hashes of the binary file.  So the image itself -- the actual pixel data -- creates a cross site correlation for a given IP address, that is searchable.<br>Also, they don't handle a user connecting through multiple IP addresses, or any communal/shared IP address, and so there's an issue there.<br>It would be appropriate, however, to do this for site operators or people in similar capacities.  (i.e. comment moderation, etc.)  I just think doing it anywhere the search robots can see it is a fundamentally bad idea.<br></p>"
