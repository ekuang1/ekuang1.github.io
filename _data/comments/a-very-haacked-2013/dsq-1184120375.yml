message: <p>Good year Phil!</p><p>About the analytics;<br></p><blockquote>By the way, does anyone know how to easily do a report in Google Analytics for content created in a year? Iâ€™d find that useful.</blockquote><p></p><p>I find the easiest way is to create a custom report that matches pages starting with /archive/2013/ in the URL, and then set the date range to the whole year.<br></p>
