message: <p>Very nice article. <br>I don't think that there is any credence to the claim laid by either side of the Dvorak v.s. QWERTY argument, but what I believe is that the change in muscle use brought by my switch to Dvorak has lessened the RSI in my wrist. And, I'm also fully prepared to switch back to QWERTY /when/ I start developing the same pain again.</p>
