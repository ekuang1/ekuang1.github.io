It focusses on relaxation, talking to your inner-self and de-stressing, but in a way which is not to everyone's liking.<br>But there's increasing evidence that RSI is linked to stress more than anything else. You may not realise it, but you may well be tense whilst working. This is especially true if your a perfectionist and always have to finish \"that last little thing...\". If you're typing all day with tense muscles and tendons in your hands, that can't be good for you.<br>This is why exercise has such a huge benefit: exercise helps you to de-stress and relax.</p>"
