message: <p>Who ever said that programming was not a full contact sport! But seriously, comming from nearly 15 years in the IT industry I have seen many disfigurements and ailments from programmers. Some people I know cannot be trusted to hold anything in their right hand from years of using a computer mouse and others constantly had neck pain.<br>I think it's something to do with how passionate and 'zoned' focus developers get into without taking any breaks and possibly that every IT office I have ever been into has been like a freezing arctic region!<br>I wonder if we will have an influx of injuries now that we are all on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brisrocket" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://twitter.com/#!/brisrocket">Twitter</a> and facebook. Speaking of which - congrats for continuing to blog with your setback!!<br>Great article Phil - thanks!</p>
