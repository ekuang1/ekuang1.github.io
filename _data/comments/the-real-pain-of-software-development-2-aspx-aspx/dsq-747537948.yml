message: <p>Most important thing I learned was what Phil mentions... Your bones don't hold you up, they just hold you together.  It's the muscles that hold you up.  So if you have neck pain, make sure you are doing some excercises.... lifting 5-10 pound weights over head is a good start.<br>Desk... 29" is great when writing with a pen, you probably want something more like 27".  Ideally desk should have adjustable height.  I like the Ikea Galant for this reason.  Keyboard trays are generally a really bad idea.  Actually OSHA has some good guidelines here.<br>Chairs... A good chair is tremendous.  I have a Steelcase Leap at home.  The OfficeMax chairs would last me about 2-3 years, a good office chair lasts about 20.  So spending $600-800 on a chair is a good investment over the $100-200 cheapies.<br>While we're on chairs... I prefer hard floors over carpet, but you need to have different wheels that don't spin as easily or you'll fling the chair out from under you when you sit down.  These are an order option for most office chairs.  If you do have carpet, invest in a high quality mat.  The cheap ones fall apart quickly, a quality mat is thicker and costs more, maybe $100 or so.  These you can get from officemax/depot/staples, but you may have to order it online as they don't always carry them in stock.<br>Keyboards... The problem with most keyboards is the keys, not the layout.  You can certainly try dvorak or split keyboards, but personally I prefer a good quality keyboard like the Keytronics E03600U2.  Easy to find, about $20-30.<br>Mice... I found don't use laptop mice as the small size causes great pain.  you may have to buy several mice before you find what you like.  I have a Logitech G5 on my desktop and a MX1000 for carrying in my laptop bag.<br>Monitor height... I've found it's best to have them up at eye level.</p>
