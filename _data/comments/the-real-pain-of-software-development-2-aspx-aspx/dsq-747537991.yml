message: <p>I had similar career limiting problems a few years ago and really thought surgery was going to be necessary.  However as, Quesi Jay mentioned, I read the same book (mindbody prescription) that I found from the <a href="http://www.rsi.deas.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.rsi.deas.harvard.edu/">Harvard rsi site</a>, took more breaks, tried to improve posture while sitting, paid more attention to where the pain was coming from and just worked on relaxing more in the evening.  Happily I can say that 10 years after first feeling the pain I can go for a straight 8-10 hours a day of coding where once I could barely type for a few minutes.<br>Also whenever I feel any pain now, I consciously try to recognize that I'm probably stressed and take immediate steps to try to relax.  Good luck to anyone having the same problems.</p>
