message: <p>Just to give my two cents to this. A good chair won't help your back. It will maybe slow down the problem, but not solve it. The one thing that helped me after years of back pain besides a good chair was movement. I started swimming and by back pain vanished away literally. Back pain is only one problem that we as developers face, but there are other problems that ergonomic chairs and desks will cure. I was diagnosed with arterial hypertension with 25, which is usually uncommon at that age, but it seems that in the recent years it gets more common. Since I had no other disease that could couse it my doctor said it is most probably combined with my profession, since I'm sitting all day long for years and don't do sports. After a while I found that hiking and swimming are good ways of activity that will save your joints and won't put to much strain on the body. Swimming involves all your muscles and is a perfect aerobic exercise. It will strengthen back and shoulder muscles that help the spine keeping a good position. My advice, go swimming 2-3 times a week for an hour or so and you will see the difference in a matter of days. My health improved immensely.</p>
