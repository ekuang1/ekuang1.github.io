message: <p>Mousing used to give me some discomfort and I switched to a trackball years ago and will never go back. If you have mouse related pain at least try a trackball; it will only drive you crazy for a day or so.  That along with a good keyboard tray have been life savers.<br>And paradoxically I have found that the better typist I have become,  the more I can keep my hands on the keyboard the more comfortable (and fast) I am. As already said, everyone is different so mileage may vary.  I know it is the geek-macho thing to just pound it out and not use heavy IDE features like intellisense, but I keep tweaking my setup with new snippets/live templates which cuts down on the "miles" my fingers need to travel.</p>
