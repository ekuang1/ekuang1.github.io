message: "<p>About three years ago I thought I would have to change careers because of repetitive stress injury (RSI). I couldn't touch a mouse without a sharp pain up my arm. I switched to my left hand, and soon thereafter the pain shot up that arm too. It made me think there was something more going on because I had just started using the left hand for mousing and would not expect the pain to develop so quickly. Soon just thinking about a keyboard or mouse would cause me pain. Eventually I found this <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Mindbody-Prescription-Healing-Body/dp/0446675156\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Mindbody-Prescription-Healing-Body/dp/0446675156\">book</a> <br>To sum it up here is what I got out of it for me, but it is different for everyone: The pain was not permanently damaging my body, so I felt OK working through it. The pain was real, but is caused by my own mind and thereby can be healed by it as well. The pain can be managed and eliminated by managing stress. Regular exercise and other stress management techniques have helped me much more than the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/UltraLite-Tension-Mouse-Carpal-Tunnel/dp/B001BS7NMS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.amazon.com/UltraLite-Tension-Mouse-Carpal-Tunnel/dp/B001BS7NMS\">weird joystick</a> mouse I bought. Or this <a href=\"http://www.evoluent.com/vm3.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.evoluent.com/vm3.html\">one</a> that I also bought. Or the hundreds and hundreds of dollars I spent on special chiropractors, accupuncture, and massage therapy sessions.</p>"
