message: <p>I used to get RSI very badly. I had pain in my neck, back, down my arms and numbness in my fingers. I had seen physio's, chiropractors and acupuncuturists, nothing helped. Then I experienced a knock to the head and had a severe concussion that stopped me from working for 4 months. It took 12 months to recover from headaches but the pains in my neck and back got worse. Riding my bike to work to try to get some exercise in the hope of aiding it was the killer blow. Holding your head stooper over your handle bars is one of the worst positions when you have weak muscles from bad posture. Again I did the rounds of the chiro etc who made it far worse. I got an MRI done and I'd perforated the cervical disc in my neck at C4/C5. The gel from inside was pushing on my spinal chord and pushing down the canals where the nerve roots go. The pain was excrutiating. I used to sit at work often with tears rolling down my face as I'd type. It got to the point where I could no longer work and finally made the hard decision to have surgery (I tried everything to avoid it but once a disc is perforated you're pretty screwed).<br>I'm now back to work and am pain free again. I am very sure to keep my posture as best I can. I get up and walk around for a couple of minutes every hour and I'm hoping to slide slowly back into an rehabilitating exercise routine. We don't know what caused the perforation, it could have been the concussion but the build up to the pain was happening for years before that so it's very much a chicken and egg situation, had my muscles been stonger I may not have caused the damage, who knows.<br>The surgeon said some people's bad postures tire out the muscles that badly that mean they just give way. So it really helps to keep your body fit and well. I have kids so finding time is hard, but having gone through 3 years of the most agonising pain that got to the point where I no longer wanted to live (seriously). The pain affected my mind in ways you can't imagine and I won't even go into what sleep deprevation because of the pain adds to the mix!<br>I'd tell anyone to find 20 minutes everyday to do something and always sit up properly and always take regular short breaks, you really don't want to find out the hard way.</p>
