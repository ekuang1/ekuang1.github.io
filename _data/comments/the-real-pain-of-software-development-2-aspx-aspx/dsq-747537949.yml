message: <p>I've dealt with low back, arm, and neck pain for a few years and I'm only in my late twenties. I eventually bought a standup desk from GeekDesk. That's probably made the biggest difference for my low back. I alternate between sitting and standing. It also helps my neck. I was also diagnosed with carpal tunnel, but my therapist said it was more likely Thorasic Outlet Syndrome. I lift and exercise pretty reguarly but didn't spend enough time addressing the muscles that get stretched out during the day... my back. I stopped benching and focused more on chest stretching and back strengthening... that probably made the biggest difference for my CT like symptoms that any PT I've done.</p>
