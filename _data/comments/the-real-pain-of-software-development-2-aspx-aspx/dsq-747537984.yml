message: <p>I recently developed back and shoulder pain several months ago. Really glad to see this and the various comments.  While I'm still dealing with the pain (PT really helped with the pain behind the shoulder blades! But I still need to work on building muscles, and trying not to slouch / lean forward when typing. It's amazing how many times a day I have to remind myself), I found that investing in a good pillow may also help alleviate some of the pain.  Maybe it's just a placebo effect, but I'd like to think I'm sleeping better so my body is healing better too.</p>
