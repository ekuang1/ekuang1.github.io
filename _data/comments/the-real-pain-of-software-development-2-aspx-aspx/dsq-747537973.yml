message: <p>After years of increasingly severe back and elbow / wrist pain, almost two years ago I switched to a sit stand desk (<a href="http://www.geekdesk.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.geekdesk.com">Geek Desk</a>). <br>I was uncertain how I would feel about it at the time, rather expected to be dissapointed in fact, but other than my kids lowering the desk for fun, I have not used a chair to code more than one or two days since then. Back, wrist, elbow pain are all gone, though my legs often feel as if I had spent all day walking (a plus, I think). Life changing for me.</p>
