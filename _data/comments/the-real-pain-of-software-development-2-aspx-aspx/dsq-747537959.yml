message: '<p>alternating your mouse hand is a good idea. Change hands every other week. The beginning is difficult.<br><br>but<br><br>i dont know if you are workjng out?<br>try this: push ups! It will train your hands, whole arms, back, shoulders and pecks.  You dont need to go to 100. If you never did push ups; Just start with 3 every other day and every week add a few more.  Until you are at min. 20.  When you can do 20 you need it minimal 2x a week for maintenance. This will break your daily keyboard routine.<br>start today, its free.</p>'
