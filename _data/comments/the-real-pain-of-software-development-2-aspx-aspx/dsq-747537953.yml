message: <p>Oddly, the only time I've ever had write pain was a few hours after I started trying to type correctly on a Dvorak key board. I think it had more to do with the correctly than with the Dvorak. It went away as soon as a switched back to may habitual typing style with my pointer fingers hovering around the 'v' and 'n' and enough other "problems" to give a a typing teacher conniptions.</p>
