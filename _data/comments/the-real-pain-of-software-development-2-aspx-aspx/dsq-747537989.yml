message: <p>I've allays used the "Comfort" keyboard from Logitech which is split in the middle to allow you to have the elbows more out to the side.<br>I also found that most people recommend you to have the screen sit relatively low on the desk. This makes me tilt forward and strains my neck. So I have my monitors quite high on the table ( my eyes just above the center of the screen).<br>Another trick is to have big fonts in your most used programs - namely Visual Studio and Outlook for me, so that you don't lean forward to see better :)<br>Worked wonders for me!<br>Good luck with the new chair :)</p>
