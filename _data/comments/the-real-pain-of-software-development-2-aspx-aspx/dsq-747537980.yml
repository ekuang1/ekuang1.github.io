message: <p>The only thing that really helps my RSI is the Vertical Mouse by Evoluent. I have used it for years now. I can no longer use a regular mouse and the trackpad is hard on my wrists as well. <br>Interestingly the few weeks that I took Aikido I noticed an improvement in my wrists. At the beginning of each Aikido class we would do a series of warmups including wrist warmups. I think I will start doing them again.</p>
