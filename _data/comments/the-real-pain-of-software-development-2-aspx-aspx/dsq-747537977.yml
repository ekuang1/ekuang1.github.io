message: "<p>It's a shame people can't move away from the idea of \"home row typing\", it would probably ease a lot of people's wrist problems. I learned to type when I was around 13, but in a \"natural\" way(ie, I wasn't taught the specific home row method of typing). I'm able to just plop my hands down on the keyboard and touch type without having to look. My left hand will generally be on ASDF or AWEF while my right hand might be on JIO: or any of the surrounding keys. This has always worked for me, typing tests put me at roughly 100 WPM. My coworkers refused to believe that I could type just fine until we all took the same typing test.<br>Having said that, I <em>can't</em> use those ergonomic keyboards with the split down the middle. The way I type, my hands are already at an angle, so the split keyboards mess up how I know the keyboard layout.</p>"
