message: <p>I completely agree. My wife is a PTA and I went from having shooting pains in my wrist everyday and wearing wrist braces to almost no pain. The right equipment makes all the difference. I'm using the Microsoft ergonomic 4000 with the wrist pad lifter as that has been proven to be the proper angel for wrist (per a ergonomic class my wife attended regarding computer related health issues), a Logitech G500 - higher DPI means less mouse movement which means less strain on my wrist, plus programming all those extra buttons help with little things - F5 to build/compile, refresh page, f12, etc. All I'm still working on is the chair - it's amazing how hard it is to get over the stereotype that $400-$500 is too much for a office chair. I argue - people pay much more than that for a Lazy Boy type chair in their living room that they only use 3 hours a night maybe. <br>Good post. We need more information out there to help change people's mindset regarding proper office equipment.</p>
