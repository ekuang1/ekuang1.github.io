message: <p>At the school I attend we have a program on our computer that is able to watch what we do inside and out of school.<br>Meebo was working for me for a while because I had a proxy for it, but now it says page can not be displayed. <br>It did this last year too and over the summer was fixed.<br>I know multiple websites, but either the can not be displayed page pops up or it is blocked.<br>They seem to be getting blocked because other people see we are on them and then they tell their friends and it gets around.<br>So, they become blocked.<br>So, I'd highly advise if you do find a site that works, to not tell a lot of people. For it will be blocked a lot faster that way.<br></p>
