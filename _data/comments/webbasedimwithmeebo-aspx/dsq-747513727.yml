message: <p>I am 16 and i am in sixth form and our school network is horrible. They block everything. And things that arn't blocked by school are blocked by our local council. Its so annoying. Even this Meebo won't work. Someone in sixth form got mozilla firefox on the computers which doesn't have the school blocker on but still has the county council one on. So does laptops. I use my laptop at school and i have got it connected to the wireless internet in school and it still has the stupid council blocker on. Its so annoying. We can't do anything.</p>
