message: <p>There's quite a number of people doing this.  I'm waiting for a Skype game to kick off soon.<br>For non-voice chat there are programs like OpenRPG that handle character sheets and dice rolling.  I'm playing in a D20 Modern game with a Hawaiin dude and a couple of New Zealanders.<br>Mainly I DM play-by-post games.  You don't have to worry about other people's timezones.  I'm in Australia and have players from Germany and the US playing.  It also lets you play games and genres that are normally hard to get players for.  Victorian Steampunk, Low Powered Supers, lighthearted B-Grade high school horror movies, Doctor Who etc...<br>You get some really different groups of players.  I'm doing a Victorian Steampunk game on 2 different sites.  One group is a bunch of historical gamers who write verbose posts in the style of the day, the other are a bunch of weirdos who made humourous characters.  As you might imagine they are very different games.<br>There's a few sites that people can advertise on for Skype and other forms of gaming, like the forums on <a href="http://rpg.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="rpg.net">rpg.net</a> and Wizards.</p>
