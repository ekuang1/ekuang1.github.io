message: <p>I had a similar idea some years before using Teamspeak but the cost for the server was prohibiting back then. I also plan to use skype for my D&amp;D sessions with my friends since we all live in different places now.<br>As for the character sheets and dice rolls you could create a free forum where you and your friends can post their characters and ofc provide them with open-content policy, character sheets and rules.<br>Then you can chat/RP live using skype and using the forum for dice rolls and keeping track of your character sheets.</p>
