message: <p>I have a role playing I created and have been wanting to play test.   My best friend and player now lives out of state and we've been talking about using skype.  I came here to see if anyone had actually done that and, if so, how well it works.</p><p>I haven't really used skype (but I do have it on my surface pro 3) so I didn't know how it works as far as being able to share maps with the other players and how it works with die rolls and stuff like that.</p><p>If anyone has first hand knowledge I would love to hear from them and any advice or pointers they might have on the subject.</p><p>Thanks.</p>
