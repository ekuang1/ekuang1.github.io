message: <p>A few years ago, when the TabletPC was hitting the mainstream, a MS guy who shall remain unnamed gave a presentation at a users group.  Afterwards, I was speaking with him and he showed me this video on his machine... I was blown away.<br>I asked him where I could find it, and he said that it's not supposed to go outside of MS, and he couldn't share it... he wasn't even supposed to show it to me.  I've been talking about it since I saw it, so I'm glad it finally got out.<br>I was told that this demo was powered by Windows XP Tablet Edition.  When the Physics Illustrator PowerToy came out for the TabletPC, I was expecting it to be what the video had shown, but it was a bit off.<br></p>
