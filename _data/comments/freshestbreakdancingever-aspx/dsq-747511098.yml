message: <p>That everyone is Junior!! I look up to him. He is sooo strong and talented. I have great balance and can do some moves, but nothing like him. He has 100% upper body strength and his arms are huge. Those moves are possible but it would take years to develope that!!<br>Later<br>oh and he does not have a fake leg!! Dummies!</p>
