message: <p>That's right.  It just seemed like <code>AddAttributesToRender</code> is the appropriate time to call that method.<br>Especially given that in most examples on the web, developers check the <code>RenderUplevel</code> boolean value first, and if false, render these attributes to the HTML instead of calling <code>RegisterExpandoAttribute</code>.  <br>I neglected doing that in my example for brevity.</p>
