message: <p>I'm still tempted to start my own from scratch. The only thing is I'm not familiar with RSS formats so writing that piece would be tricky. Wanna help? ;)<br><br><br><br>I started with .Text for the same reason, SQL support (although I wanted MySQL instead). I've been able to tinker around in .Text and have been happy with my ability to extend it without touching the base code, and that I like. But I'd like more security so that you could have different users modify this and that.<br><br><br><br>Oh well, who am I kidding? I've got a 2 1/2 year old and another one on the way due in July. I won't have time to read my own blog much less write anything else!</p>
