message: <p>In high school I loved math, but I became bored with it in college.  Luckily, I stayed with it, because just at the 300 level I came to love again in a whole new way.  It's hard to describe to non-math people, but once you can start seeing the beauty in proofs it really becomes fun and creative.  <br>Abstract Algebra is when it really hit me.  I'm pretty sure I could work my way through the first book, but if I ever wanted to get through my third semester book (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/39qakb)on" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tinyurl.com/39qakb)on">http://tinyurl.com/39qakb)on</a> Ideals and Varieties, I might as well just take the class again.<br>I'm still trying to think of a brilliant computer program I can build with Abstract Algebra.</p>
