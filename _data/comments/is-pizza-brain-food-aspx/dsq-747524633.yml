message: <p>YES!! Pizza is brain food! Not just brain food but you may argue the perfect brain food and here's a scientific explanation why:<br>Your brain needs 3 main chemical compotents to function at it's best. Achetylcholine (ACH) responsible for memory a food rich in this is CHEESE. Next we have Dopamine which helps with learning so be sure to put lots of pepperoni on your pizza or sausage or any other kind of meat you like. Finally there's Serotonin which affects our mood in particular our sense of pleasure foods rich in this are CARBOHYDRATES pizza crust! So eating a pizza will not only effect how well your learn but given the Serotinin intake it will also make studying seem a little more fun.<br>Also remember that the biggest college student mistake is breakfast! They'll either skip it or eat something loaded in carbohydrates which will stump the oxygen supply at a crucial time so instead of a pancake breakfast try something more protein based.</p>
