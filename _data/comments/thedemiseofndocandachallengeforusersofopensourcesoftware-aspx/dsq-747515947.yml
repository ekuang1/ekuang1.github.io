message: "<p>@Vern: Thanks!<br>@Scott: I am <strong>just</strong> like your friend in that I absolutely do try and use this excuse in an attempt to get out of housework.  Never works, but I try.<br>I think this excuse has some validity when the thing you are doing is directly related to your profession.  I can't count soccer time as lost revenue.  But writing code?  Why not?  <br>I could spend that time trying to develop a commercial product and sell it as a Micro-ISV.  Or I could spend that time trying to drum up more business for my company.<br>If I instead contribute it to writing code, why shouldn't I consider that a valuable contribution.<br>Now if I was an employee and whether I worked more or less made no difference to my bottom line, then you have a good point.<br>However value is really in the eye of the beholder, no?  How valuable is it when someone contributes an hour of solid work to Subtext?  Well I'd pay decent money for that kind of work if I could.<br>But the currency of open source is not money, it's different for everybody, but often includes one or more of the following: learning experience, recognition, satisfaction of giving, necessity, etc...</p>"
