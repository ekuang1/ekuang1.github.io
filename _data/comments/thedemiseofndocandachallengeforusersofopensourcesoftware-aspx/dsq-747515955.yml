message: "<p>\"Just for your record, no one would use a technology such as OR/M other than someone who plans to make money out of his or her own product. Many I.T. companies wouldn’t consider buying OR/M or Frameworks because they are too many Open-Source projects available these days. As for how good they are I’d leave the judgment to you.\"<br>I beg to differ. :)<br>The reason is simple: it's a choice between:<br>- hire a couple of people and let them write the part, which costs a lot of $$$ and time<br>- buy an off the shelve product which is debugged, tested and supported for $<br>you do the math. <br>Open source is often not used in businesses because the mindset of companies that an open source product is likely to go belly up once the contributors to the project find other things to do with their time. That's often true but not always of course. Fun thing is that the succesful open source projects are all (or mostly all) developed by people who work full time on the projects payed by a company who by doing that invests in the project. <br>I've spend alone more than 10000 hours on LLBLGen Pro, something I don't want to 'give away for free'. The reason is simple: My family and I have to eat, pay bills etc. and I have to pay the people who work for me, pay for hardware etc.. Working on that big project is what I do for a living. Why is asking money in return for my hard work something bad? I don't see it. <br>However, if I COULD give it away, e.g. I had unlimited money sources, I would. I have released succesful open source projects in the past and I'll do it again in a heartbeat if I had the time. <br>I don't like the \"I went to the bathroom but you still have to pay me an hourly fee\"-kind of mindset of some consultants, but I also don't like the \"It has to be free!\"-mindset of some people who simply think their money is better spend on something else than the hard work of some person or company. I always think in that case: \"do they also call Dell for a free computer because they think their money is better spend on something else?\". <br>I would have shelled out 200$ for NDoc, no problem: it does the job it has to do, fast, no questions asked. Because we needed a .NET 2.0 version, we had to move to a commercial toolkit, which I don't like as it's slower and buggy but there aren't a lot of alternatives... <br>Open source as an initiative to make software freely available to anyone who wants to use it, that's good. However it's not a given. It doesn't give you as the user any rights on the work or what the contributors have to do. From the contributor's point of view: open source is only free if your time is free. If you have to pay your bills from your own pocket, who's going to fill these pockets at the end of the month? Likely it will be no-one. So unless you have deep pockets, you'll run out of money and have to find a job, which means less time to spend on the project, if at all. This is the logical reason why succesful open source projects are actually funded by companies. For example most linux kernel developers are working for redhat or novell, most open office developers work for sun, most java tools developers work for ibm, etc. Nothing strange about that. Bills have to be payed. <br>It's sad that the NDoc author ran into this misery though. I fully agree this is completely insane. What I find sad is that the project seems to be managed so poorly. I doubt there weren't any developers willing to contribute to it. Why leave it to 1 developer to come up with a proper .net 2.0 working version? It's open source after all, contribution of sourcecode to the project should be trivial, fast and smooth. <br>IF I had time, I would be willing to contribute to it, no problem. I hope the few people who have tried to make ndoc 2.0 workable get together and restart the project with proper management. After all, the tool already works OK, how much code do you need to change to make it workable with .net 2.0?</p>"
