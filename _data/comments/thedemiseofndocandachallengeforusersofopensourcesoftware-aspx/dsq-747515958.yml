message: <p>Frankly, I can't understand why someone should be able to criticise an Open-Source project for being managed poorly? Surely that wasn't the NDoc's failure or was it? We wouldn't know for how long Kevin was being intimated for.<br>The project is for free therefore no one has the right to criticise anything. Users also have the right not to use the project in the first place.<br>Maybe spending 10 times the cost and waiting for months developers to finish the same type of project would teach the "Business Community" to appreciate Open-Source projects more.<br>I'm glad to see Frans posted a reply in here. In regards to "You do the math" I can only say some managers really don't understand this concept. They assume having developers allow them to develop all the in-house technology they need without calculating the cost of development and maintenance. Some don’t get it, writing a good code is only half of the story.<br>When the managers are non-technical they'd leave the decision of choosing such technologies to the developers. The problem with this is that the developers that are on hourly paid basis or the developers who don't like changes would vote against such technologies.<br>In my licensing plan I give away all the source code that was written as the Base Library as well. Something other OR/Ms would also do but at extra cost. I'm not doing this for competitiveness because as Frans would probably agree with me each OR/M is designed the way the author sees 'data' and that is the reason why known OR/M technologies are designed differently and users would buy the OR/M that comes close the way they see the data. So the way I look at it there isn’t a real competition among OR/M Tools.<br>Even though I mention to my clients that they would get all the Base Library Source Codes they would normally make the following comment, "The Downside is we don't get the source code of your OR/M Wizard". <br>The open-source concept has changed the mind of “Business Community” to extend that if they don't get source code for something they pay for then they wouldn't consider it as valuable purchase. I would say even many developers think this way these days, “I am not going to use this .DLL if I can’t have the source code first”.<br>Most known open-source projects are managed in western countries but probably heavily used by developing and non-developed countries. India is a developing country which has caused so many job losses and pay cuts in USA, Canada, and Europe.<br>Probably a country like India heavily uses Open-Source and all the resources (Forums, Blogs, and Technical Sites) managed by the same countries that all the jobs were lost.<br>Any developing or non-developed country is not capable of producing qualified developers for every single project that are running in the country. So they have to rely on resources that I mentioned. This is the strategy of today’s I.T. World “Hire cheap developers and ask them to Google what the senior developers know”. The development communities in western countries give free resources to countries like India and India in return takes most of the projects away. <br>As we all know MS is very much against Open-Source but they sponsor sites like GotDotNet, Asp.NET, and more to make resources freely available to us developers. Then MS announces spending $6-7 Billions in India to make sure they can shift more projects to India.<br>Let me tell you, Microsoft loves you so much for spending hours and hours writing technical Articles based on their platform/products for free which they earn from it indirectly, and millions of dollars that is. The community helps others to learn faster and the same community helps to reduce your salary and cuts jobs. Once I read an article (not too sure where) about how I.T. Managers think developers are “Plug &amp; Play”. Why is that?<br>Indians are very hard working people and I wish them all well. If this is India’s right to have a Business Strategy that causes loss some where else then this is my right to make awareness to cut my loss as well as others. Same thing applies to Open-Source’s Business Strategy.<br>Sorry Guys I never meant to write this much for the second time.</p>
