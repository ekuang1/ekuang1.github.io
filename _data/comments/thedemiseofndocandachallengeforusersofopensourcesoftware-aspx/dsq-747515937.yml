message: <p>I don't see a single button I can click for donating to Subtext (either here or on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtext/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtext/">http://sourceforge.net/proj...</a> or at <a href="http://www.subtextproject.com/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.subtextproject.com/)">http://www.subtextproject.c...</a>. Did I just miss it or is there another way to donate to Subtext?<br>In another post you asked about CMS software. I commented about "The Philosophy" of <a href="http://AxCMS.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="AxCMS.net">AxCMS.net</a>. That comment is also relevant to this post. They have a business model that seems not unlike Red Hat (and others) except they started with a very small project instead of a linux distro. Check it out here:<br><a href="http://www.axinom.com/axcms_philosophy.AxCMS?ActiveID=6780" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.axinom.com/axcms_philosophy.AxCMS?ActiveID=6780">http://www.axinom.com/axcms...</a><br>I'm wondering if there isn't a way to tweak that philosophy even further to make it possible for teams to work on "open source" projects as a full time vocation.<br>I know <a href="http://AxCMS.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="AxCMS.net">AxCMS.net</a> is not open source. It doesn't even appear to be shared source or available source or anything like that. <br>But would their business model of charging for customization and support (again, essentially the same as Red Hat's business model) work for a small open source project? If not, could we figure out a type of license that would give some of the benefits of open source while also enabling projects to be more viable? I mean it doesn't do much good for NDoc to be open source if no one wants to actively develop it. On the other hand, if a couple guys could pay their bills while working on NDoc full time (while the software stays "100% free" to borrow <a href="http://AxCMS.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="AxCMS.net">AxCMS.net</a>'s term) that would benefit the whole community - even if the NDoc license had a few more restrictions of some type, right? What restrictions would it take in order to make the <a href="http://AxCMS.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="AxCMS.net">AxCMS.net</a> business model work?</p>
