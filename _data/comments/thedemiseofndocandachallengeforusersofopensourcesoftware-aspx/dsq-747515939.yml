For example, NDoc is not a mission critical app, nor is it extremely complex to use. It would be hard to charge for customization and support for such a product and make a viable business out of it.<br>I think there is still a chance for the NDocs of the world to thrive as open source software.  For something used by so many developers, it might just take a kick in the pants for people to realize it is worth contributing to, now that it is gone.</p>"
