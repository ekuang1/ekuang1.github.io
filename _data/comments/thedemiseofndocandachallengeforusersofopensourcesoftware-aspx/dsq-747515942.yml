message: <p>@Jeff - "Contributions" take many forms, not just talking about it.  <br>I do agree that in the scale of value, monetary contributions (unless <strong>extremely</strong> large and sent to my paypal account) hold the least value.<br>Considering what I charge for my time as a software consultant, every hour I put in is way more than I can part with monetarily.<br>But I disagree that we should say, "forget monetary contributions, buy commercial products instead." Why reduce choice in this issue? Not everybody has or wants to contribute their time.  <br>Running an open source project has real monetary costs from hosting to purchasing development tools for which there are no viable open source counterparts.  So monetary contributions, even small ones, are helpful.<br>Ultimately, I just hope that more people consider a form of contribution (in any form) when they find some open source software that is really useful to them.</p>
