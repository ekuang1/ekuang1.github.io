message: <p>Nice and useful article, thanks<br>I saw, at least in passing, revenue models for open source being discussed...thought I'dadd my 2c to it...making revenues from free &amp; open source software is one of the most frequently asked questions these days. While there have been a few successful examples of companies (like MySQL, Red Hat etc) which are making money, I’d surmise that these are still very early days for open source revenue &amp; profit models.<br>While open source as an operational paradigm certainly has been having exceptional success against proprietary and closed-software models in the recent past, in my opinion, a lot more thought need to be given and experimentations done before the emergence of viable revenue models for the free &amp; open source models that can successfully compete with the current proprietary software revenue model. Some specifics of the business models are emerging fast, but it will take a few years for the market to test each of these out and hopefully, the fittest will survive.<br>A site that focuses exclusively on revenue models from free, open source software is <a href="http://Follars.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Follars.com">Follars.com</a> – Free, Open-source Dollars - <a href="http://www.follars.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.follars.com">http://www.follars.com</a> !<br>Ec @ IT, Software Database @ <a href="http://www.eit.in" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.eit.in">http://www.eit.in</a> <br></p>
