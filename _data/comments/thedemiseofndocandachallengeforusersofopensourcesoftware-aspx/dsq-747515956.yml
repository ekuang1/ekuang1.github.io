message: <p>Strict GPL can turn off most businesses. LGPL or something a little more forgiving would give people the incentive to make commercial apps (and commit those changes back to the originator) while still giving individuals the freedom to fork or do whatever they want with it.<br>Frans in correct in stating the project seemed to be managed poorly. I think it was a lot of little straws that broke this camel's back. <br>I already need a straight XML/XSL CHM compiler and not having to do that from scratch would save me time. It's for my employer so I have to accept that they may or may not wish me to release our source. After all, they are paying me for my time spent but I'd gladly contribute nuggets I found along the way regardless of wether or not I could release the complete source of that nugget. I may have saved them money but I can't always convince people how "right" or "just" the contribution would be.<br>There's also the reality that the people behind any project are people and they may not value your ideas, thoughts, or contributions. I get turned off quickly when my idea for a small feature that I will fully implement goes unnoticed. I don't feel like working on something for weeks (granted very little at a time) only to have the maintainer completely gut what I did or just not use it. Their time may be valuable to them but my time is valuable to me. I now no longer blindly contribute but simply ask if what I plan to work on will get merged at some point. If not, I'm not going to bother wasting both of our time. I've been down the path of consistently merging my changes with the source to have a more personalized (better for me) version but it gets old after about the second conflict.</p>
