message: <p>"Considering what I charge for my time as a software consultant, every hour I put in is way more than I can part with monetarily."<br>I have a friend who says things like this constantly. Usually to get out of doing something. He'll use it to justify hiring a maid rather than cleaning his apartment. Then I'll ask him what he did that day, "read some blogs and watched FoodTV". "Wow, for  how long?" "About 4 hours", "So how much did that 'cost' you?". The point being, how much you charge for you time is irrelevant if you are doing something you WANT to do. Do you count Soccer time as potential revenue lost? ;)<br>I think it also comes down to your skillset. I'm not a kernel programmer. So the only way I can contribute to a kernel is by talking about it. I supposed I could offer to comment the new patches on a project. I know my way around slashes and asterisks.<br></p>
