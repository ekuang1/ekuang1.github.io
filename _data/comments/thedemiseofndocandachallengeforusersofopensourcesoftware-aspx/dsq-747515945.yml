message: <p>The original idea of Open-Source projects was formed to stop companies that used their market positions to sell their technologies at very high price and to make similar technologies available to smaller businesses. <br>So that means the users of Open-Source projects are mainly business communities not the community that most Open-Source projects portrait as “the Developers Community”. I’m sure there are some exceptions to this, i.e. SubText project which has no true business value.<br>In my opinion the single individual developers who come up with wonderful technologies and turn it in to a very popular solution would actually do the most damage to the community, why?<br>First ask yourself where the developer is going to use these project(s)? If the developer is just a developer then he or she is working for a company right? That means the company will financially benefit from the Open-Source project not the developer who developed the project. Once the company have more of these Open-Source projects then they start cutting cost by getting rid of the developers which are no longer necessary for the company to pay, normally the experienced ones because they are on the higher salaries.<br>Projects like NDoc and NUnit has business values because both are used in Software Development Life Cycle. It would cost a company to either develop such Tools in-house or purchase them. In either case developers will be paid for such projects, so this is not just the business is going to have the financial benefit.<br>The Open-Source Projects which have business value should be changed to commercial Projects but then they should cost low so that it can be available to all business communities not just the ones with big wallet.<br>I’m really saddened for Kevin going through such experience after putting so much work into his project. Incidentally I haven’t used NDoc or NUnit yet. Kevin should turn his project to a commercial project and make himself a small business and finically benefit from it rather than the “Business Community” only. I would say only someone who is making money directly or indirectly out of Kevin’s project dares to send email like that.<br>A word of advice…<br>Don’t let the “Business Community” to cash in on your talents and enthusiasm in software development by starting a successful Open-Source project which that will also destroy the livelihood of other developers in the community.<br>I have put in over 4300 hours (fulltime) so far in my OR/M project. No sponsorship and no income while I’ve been working on this project, I’ve been living with very little money but still I’m not prepared to turn my project in to a Free project where I know the business communities will use it. Just for your record, no one would use a technology such as OR/M other than someone who plans to make money out of his or her own product. Many I.T. companies wouldn’t consider buying OR/M or Frameworks because they are too many Open-Source projects available these days. As for how good they are I’d leave the judgment to you.<br>I have always envied the SAP community on how secretive they are about what they know and that was the key for them to have very little pay cut after 9/11 comparing to the rest of us. How many Open-Source projects for SAP do you know comparing to .NET projects? I know this is not the best comparison but I think you get the point.<br>If you haven’t noticed the price of I.T. products are keep going up in the same rate as the rest of the commodities in the market but the salary of developers unlike other workers have gone down actually despite of the fact developers today has to work much harder to be qualified for recruitment. Ask yourself why? <br>Don’t believe the statistics printed by I.T. publishers what counts is what your recruitment agent actually is willing to pay you.</p>
