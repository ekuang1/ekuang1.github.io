message: <p>&gt; Look at the open source software you use and consider making a tiny contribution to the project if you find it useful<br>Or you could just buy commercial software.<br>Personally, I think "contributing" to OSS really means talking about it in public so you organically grow the community and knowledge around it. That's far, FAR more valuable than sending them a buck or whatever.<br>And it's the key differentiator between the two.</p>
