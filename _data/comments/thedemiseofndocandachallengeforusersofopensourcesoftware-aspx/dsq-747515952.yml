message: <p>I completely understand Kevin. I´m in the open source world for less than a year now and I´m developing a smaller project and is a lot frustrating to know that the people wants that you finish some feature now and don't contribute at all in that or other part of the library. <br><br>There are BTW a lot of other people that try to help and that suggest new features, thing that is the "open source" idea and I live of these feedback. <br><br>But at the end we all need money to live, so if you have two jobs like me and also develop an open source project, your family, your girlfriend and your friends become agains you and you lose somethings that if you was getting some donations and can dedicate full time to the projects, all parts win. <br>Anyway just my view 2 cents to the discuss<br>Best Regards</p>
