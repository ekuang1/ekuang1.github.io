message: "<p>I do mainly play WoW, and in this game, it's incredibly simple. Everything that is in the game is owned by Blizzard, the player simply has the licence to use it and is not allowed to even sell it on eBay. This forbids any real-world value.<br><br><br><br>Simply put: It's only a game, and nothing that ever happens in there should ever affect the real world, and no player has the right to stab anybody to dead because the other guy just unlawfully used the first guy's assets. Those assets are all Blizzard's anyway.</p>"
