For example, a virtual police officer would investigate the theft and selling, track down the buyer, inform him that he has stolen property and ...

If the arbitration process couldn't come up with a solution, then they'd take it to the real law.  I'm only throwing this out there. I'm not sure if it'd work in real life (or virtual).</p>
