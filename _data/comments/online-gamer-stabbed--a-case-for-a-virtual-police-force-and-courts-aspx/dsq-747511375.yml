message: <p>I was just suggesting to my Fiancee that it's time I got out of developement and moved to Virtual property assessment. <br><br><br><br>While I was kidding around, it is possible for this to happen, I don't doubt that a reliable ROI/risk assessmenet study could mean that Insurers start taking on virtual possessions. The GDP for virtual trade as a whole is eclipsing the GDP of a good deal of countries already - I don't have a source for this anymore but it has been taken as a serious economic study.</p>
