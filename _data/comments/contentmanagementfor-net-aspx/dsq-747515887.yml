message: <p>Today in 2010, the best CMS from architecture vision based ont .Net 3.5 and flexibility is probably N2 CMS from opensource world, and Sitefinity from commercial software. Kentico is very good too becouse of very user friendly editing interface but it's API a bit outdated and all based on .Net 2.0 DataSets, DataTables etc.</p>
