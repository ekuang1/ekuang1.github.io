message: "<p>Hi all. I'm currently looking at solutions right now after playing with Joomla for a few weeks. Joomla has some problems:<br>1) Probably the WORST and least responsive user community I've seen yet for any product<br>2) Base confusion as to what the product does, how it does it, and what's important. Most of the templates talk about \"tableless design\" and then leave the default \"views\" which use tables.<br>3) If you look at the underlying code, it's poorly written and poorly optimized for speed (which matters because PHP is interpreted). So it's not surprising that the end results are SLOWWWW...<br>4) I could go on, but this is not the right forum for it. Anyway...<br>I was excited about Dot Net Nuke until I tried out their website, which is broken in so many places that it left me wondering if I want to start with that.<br>And now I'm going to look at Umbraco. Looks like they have their stuff together, but I don't know how much is done and how much is doable... I really have simple needs, but Joomla was killing me and wasted so much of my time for very unimpressive results. Now I'm back to the drawing board again. It pains me to say it, but I really like .Net and GoDaddy makes it all cheap to implement.<br>Dan<br><a href=\"http://www.SATTutorInABox.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"www.SATTutorInABox.com\">www.SATTutorInABox.com</a><br>America's #1 Private SAT Tutor<br>Now on Video</p>"
