message: <p>I understand that this is a request for .NET apps, but I have to say, that for straightforward content management, I don't think that there is anything out there (at least in the open-source arena) that can compete with the PHP project, CMS Made Simple.  <a href="http://www.cmsmadesimple.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cmsmadesimple.com">http://www.cmsmadesimple.com</a> - hands-down, it is the most straightforwardly conceived CMS out there.  I've used PostNuke, DotNetNuke, Umbraco, and have even coded my own very simple CMS.  Give it a spin and you'll be up and running creating HTML or CSS templates in an hour.<br>I've recently been working on a DotNetNuke project, and can definitely attest to the fact that it is absolutely more powerful than CMS Made Simple - but more power is not always the best way to accomplish a task.  I find that anything CMS Made Simple can not accomplish, I'd rather code myself from scratch.</p>
