message: <p>Talking about customizations I want to say that DotNetNuke has a number of developer-oriented modules. One of them - <strong>XsltDb</strong>. It offers  a web-based development with syntax highlighting and codecompletion, provides direct access to database and ASP.NET controls usage. Since DNN 5.2+ goes with Telerik ASP.NET controls your customizations are limited only by your imagination. XsltDb is free and opensource. Download it from <a href="http://xsltdb.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://xsltdb.codeplex.com">http://xsltdb.codeplex.com</a></p>
