message: <p>It's too bad you can't link tags back into your own subtext install.  For example if I wanted a tag to just take me to my tag page for it at the standard subtext tag url on my blog (ie <a href="http://myblog.com/Tag/Sometag/default.aspx)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://myblog.com/Tag/Sometag/default.aspx)">http://myblog.com/Tag/Somet...</a> the thing which is actually recorded as the tag is default.aspx.  Remove the default.aspx and you get a broken link.<br>Forgive me if there is some part of blogging lore which says you must link to Technorati and not back to your own site for tags; I am not much of a blogger...</p>
