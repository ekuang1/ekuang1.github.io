message: <p>Hello,<br>Nicely done on the 97 on website grader.  That number is relative to every other url in the database (north of 10,000 urls, btw).  I might recommend you fill in the "website type" drop-down the next time you use it to check your rank relative to your peer group.  I checked for you and it was a little lower than your 97, but still quite respectable.<br>In a future release of websitegrader, you'll have the ability to track history on all those great metrics in the report.<br>Incidentally, we found ourselves checking Alexa, Technorati, Google Analytics, and Feedburner to see how we were performing over and over again.  That was getting old, so part of our core product offering (hubspot) is a mashup of all this great information.  It saves a ton of time looking at tabs.  ...If you ever have interested in taking a peak at that, drop us a note.<br>Brian.</p>
