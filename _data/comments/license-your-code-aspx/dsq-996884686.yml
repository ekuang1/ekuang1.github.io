message: <p>The ironic thing is that at some point GitHub was the only popular service that did not have mandatory choice of license (as compared to SourceForge and Google Code). And NuGet gallery does not require license, which I noted before as quite bad (for example, for GPL packages).</p><p>If services do not care (and actually regress from older and better practices), it is quite expected that users of these services do not care as well.</p>
