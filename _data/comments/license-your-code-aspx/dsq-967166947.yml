message: <p>I'm not aware of any provision within the AGPL that restricts who may look at the code. Can you point it out?</p><p>&gt; Many commercial shops forbid their people from doing ANYTHING with AGPL code including downloading or even looking at it</p><p>And many commercial shops don't allow employees from looking at _any_ open source code at all. I don't think the focus of the site should be how some reactionary employers approach open source. I think it should be about distilling the essence of the licenses themselves as much as possible.</p>
