message: <p>I think that it is in Microsoft's best interest to promote Open Source, at least to some degree.  I started out programming only with Microsoft technologies (SQL Server, VB).  Once I started professionally programming, I got sucked into the Open Source world of PHP and MySQL.<br>It's not that I think PHP and MySQL are any better than their Microsoft counterparts (they are equally as good though), it's because of the wealth of GPL code out there written for them.<br>If I want to create a CMS, e-commerce, wiki, image gallery, CRM, forums, etc I can do it all out of the box with open source code.  And I have thousands of different versions I can choose from out there (<a href="http://opensourcecms.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="opensourcecms.com">opensourcecms.com</a> anyone?).<br>The point is, it would be easier for me to push .NET solutions on clients if I knew I could start the project with tens of thousands of lines already written and tested.<br>As it stands, I find the majority of highly talented developers use .NET in their professional life so you can still get good help, but as far as pet projects go, they all are getting created in PHP/MySQL.</p>
