message: "<p>I also think that MS should support Open source project Financially, but I think that the facts are more far than this discussion, let me explain it:<br>At the begging I always think: why the .NET 1.1 comes with a DataGrid with so little functionality ?<br>The answer is clear... If they add functionality they can generate more bugs, so they waste more money and time, but a bit more far the answer is that there are a lot of companies in the world providing all the kinds of grids that you can think, so if they add a fully functional grid MS become against that companies and in the marketing world nothing worst that this. The money that the companies waste in components and libraries is bigger than the cost of VS and some times that MSDN no body in the bussiness want that the open source projects take this place, what do you think ?<br>There are commercial alternatives to a lot of OpenSource projects (just go to <a href=\"http://www.componentsource.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"www.componentsource.com\">www.componentsource.com</a>) if MS put money in open source project like NDoc all the companies that provides that kind of app sure don't love the idea. (and if new companies entering to the market se that maybe them think twice before begin a development of a project that has a MS supportes OS alternative)<br>IÂ´m the open source developer of an small project and will be really nice if MS give away some MSDN subscription or some Mouse or Keyboards ;) like you said when somebody share something as an open source project he like to give his work to the community and want the feedback and congrats of the community.<br>Sorry for the long post and my bad english.<br>Marcos (from Argentina)</p>"
