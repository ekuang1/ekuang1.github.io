message: <p>Niels Hartvig, of umbraco, left a couple comments on my original article. His comments helped me clarify my position. I think it boils down to this:<br>1. The .NET open source community is part of Microsoft's home turf. Most of these developers are using Visual Studio on Windows. And many commercial 100% Microsoft development shops benefit from the products produced by these open source projects. <br>2. Microsoft itself is, by far, the biggest, wealthiest, most powerful entity in this particular community.<br>3. The .NET open source projects receive financial support from many, many others in the community, but they do not receive any direct financial support from Microsoft.<br>We have to ask why the richest and most powerful player in the community keeps its hands in its pockets while smaller, much less wealthy people and companies in the same community offer their financial support. <br>In the physical world, the wealthy citizens and companies have an obligation to do more for their communities. With wealth and power comes responsibility. It is the same online.<br>If we believe open source projects belong in the .NET community, then it only makes sense that Microsoft should be among those making selective financial contributions to open source projects. <br>Microsoft is not responsible for keeping any independent open source project afloat, but the entire financial burden should not fall on everyone EXCEPT Microsoft.</p>
