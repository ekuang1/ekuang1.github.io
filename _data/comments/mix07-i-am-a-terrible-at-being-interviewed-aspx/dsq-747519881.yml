message: <p>I have felt your pain.  Some folks just make it look so easy (Hansleman, Sells, Box, etc.) that you figure, hey if they can do it, so can I.  But, they just make it look easy.  I've found that a good post production team (like the .Net Rocks team) will make you sound a lot better, but most podcasts/audio interviews don't have the budget for that sort of post production work.<br>And then there is dealing with the various print media (online or magazine).  You have to be extra careful what you say to them, because they will just take snippets of your statements, and out of context it can sound very different than what you actually meant.  It's bad enough that Word can't figure out what I meant to say, instead of just using what I typed.  A reporter can really twist your words to say what they want, not what you intended.<br>Don Demsak</p>
