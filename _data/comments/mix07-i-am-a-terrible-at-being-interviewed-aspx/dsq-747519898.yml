message: <p>My name is Maury and I work for Microsoft on the TechEd event. I generally read IT blogs to keep up with what is going on in the industry and decided to jump on in with a little plug for TechEd 2007 (June 4 – 8). This year we’ve dedicated 50% of the event content to developer specific tools with deep technical training that covers Visual Studio® 2005, Windows Vista™ development and the .NET Framework. You can also get in-depth information on building software using Visual C++®, Visual Basic® and Visual C#®. The incredible amount of information you can learn at TechEd is awesome but it is also an incredible place to network and let loose a little. The event is in Orlando, FL this year so the attendee party is at Universal Studios Islands of Adventure and the place is reserved for TechEd attendees only! Trust me, these parties are a blast. If you decide to go you should register now before it sells out like it did last year…we are also offering a bit of an incentive, all registrations before May 11th are entered to win either 1 of 5 Xbox 360 Elites (killer graphics) or 1 of 5 Amex gift cards (Disney ain’t cheap!) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/teched" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.microsoft.com/teched">www.microsoft.com/teched</a></p>
