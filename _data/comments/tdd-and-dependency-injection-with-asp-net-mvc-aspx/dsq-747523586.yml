message: <p>Excellent stuff Phil!<br>I am definately looking forward to this. Even though I am very biased and love monorail. I think you guys have finally hit the nail on the head this time. Couple this with the fact that you are now at MS, I think this will be very good! =)<br>The only thing I really don't like, and I'm sure you've heard this already, is the fact that every action requires a [ControllerAction] attribute. IMO, this is a lot of extra typing that isn't necessarily needed. I know you guys are trying to help out by making sure the developer knows what exactly they are exposing, but education would be more powerful here than requiring a specific attribute on every method. Just my 2 cents tho!<br>Is there anyway that we can make it so any public methods are automatically set as actions in a configuration or something along those lines?<br>Also, is there a way to set values to send back to the view in an array rather than passing them to RenderView? Like PropertyBag[] in MonoRail?<br>Other then that everything looks pretty good! Great Job!! Looking forward to the CTP</p>
