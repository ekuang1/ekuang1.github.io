message: <p>@Phil,<br>The first item to get committed to the trunk of mvccontrib was a StructureMapControllerFactory.<br>You can check it out here:<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib">http://www.codeplex.com/MVC...</a><br>We're going to go public and advertise more once we can build against the public CTP.  Then it will make more sense for the public to use it.</p>
