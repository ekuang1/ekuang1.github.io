message: <p>However you might feel about TDD, love it or hate it, you have to admit that it's a lot of work to setup. <br>The funny thing is that it doesn't keep errors from occurring. <br>The funnier thing is that the link to the code download on this site is currently broken and I can't download it. <br>I guess you should have written a test that Asserts that your links are valid. :)</p>
