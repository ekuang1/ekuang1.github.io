message: <p>The other alternative is to use TypeMock and mock the HttpContext.  That works pretty well and hasn't caused me a build error yet. :)<br>Of course, it does imply you're willing to go with TypeMock (which I love and highly recommend, and which there is a free "Community" version that should work just fine for this).  Not everyone is as gung-ho for TypeMock as I am, but it does solve problems like this very nicely...</p>
