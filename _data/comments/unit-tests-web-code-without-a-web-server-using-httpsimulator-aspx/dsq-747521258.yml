message: <p>Adding this comment for future reference... for anyone experiencing the "System.Web.Configuration.IConfigMapPath is inaccessible due to its protection level" problem, the ConfigMapPath class is really only needed if you require programmatic access to the MapPath property within a unit test. If you don't, then comment out the internal ConfigMapPath class and the line that calls it (both in HttpSimulator.cs) and recompile. That gets it to work on your non-Vista dev machine and non-Vista build machine. At least that's how I fixed it anyway.</p>
