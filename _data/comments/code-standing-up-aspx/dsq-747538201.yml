message: <p>I've seen this research come up a lot recently, and there may very well be something to it, but it does seem like some grand conclusions are being reached by a lot of correlational evidence. It's sort of like saying, Japanese people smoke more than we do, and they live longer than us, so smoking must be healthy.<br>Even if the correlation is proven to be causation, what does it mean when they say "sitting 6 hours a day makes you up to 40% likelier to die within 15 years than someone who sits less than 3"? They don't mention the odds of dying if you avoid sitting, so it comes across as a bit alarmist. Let's say that the odds of a 30 year-old dying in the next 15 years are 1/1000 or 0.1%. If you sit all day at work, then your odds of dying would be 0.14% (again, assuming sitting really is the cause). That's still a sizable increase, but not quite as dramatic as the "40% increase" would have you believe.<br>My final issue is that they appear to control for exercise (which is good), but they don't seem to control for body weight. Instead, they claim that sitting is a *cause* of high body weight. The mechanistic arguments that sitting reduces electrical activity, calorie burning, fat-burning enzyme production, and insulin effectiveness gives some credence to the argument that sitting directly contributes to obesity, but it's difficult to tease apart whether it's purely a matter of calories-in calories-out, or whether sitting actually adds something on top of that equation. <br>All that said, these studies are all about population averages. What matters is you. If you are experiencing any ergonomic discomfort from sitting all day, taking more breaks and sitting less total time are no-brainers. If you are overweight, doing something that burns more calories than sitting is also a no-brainer. If you are fit, exercise more than 30 minutes average per day, have good cholesterol, have good energy levels, and yet still find yourself sitting for 8+ hours a day, I wouldn't panic.</p>
