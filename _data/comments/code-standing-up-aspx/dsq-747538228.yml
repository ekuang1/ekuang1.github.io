message: <p>After looking at all these fancy adjustable desks for months and dreading shelling out hundreds of Â£ I stumbled upon this at Ikea - <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/S99834380/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/S99834380/">www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/S99834380/</a>. Turns out to be the perfect height for me. I put a different top on it to the recommended one and I have plenty of room for 3 big monitors. I got a bar stool that I sit on from time to time, but mostly standing is great!</p>
