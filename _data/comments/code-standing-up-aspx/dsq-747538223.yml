message: <p>At work we are lucky because in some redesigned areas we have standing desks available for anyone, first-come, first-serve. A couple people in the traditional "cube" areas lift their laptops and monitors on makeshift printer paper stacks to emulate a standing desk. I'd feel more comfortable standing up at home, but I don't have a standing desk there either.</p>
