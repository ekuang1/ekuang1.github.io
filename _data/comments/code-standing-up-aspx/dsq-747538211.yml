message: <p>I wonder how many of these health-related issues are caused by people putting off bathroom breaks for too long?  Seriously, I'd buy into maybe leg circulation issues, back problems, stiffness, carpal tunnel, and similar but cutting quality years off a person's life???  I would like to find out what stress these people are under that they are sitting for 6 hours straight in the workplace.  There certainly are mitigating circumstances.  That said, I'm one of those people that eats standing up.  I also like to use my laptop when I'm on the treadmill.  Still, I doubt I'm adding any quality years to my life by the former and maybe not even the latter (short of toning some muscles).</p>
