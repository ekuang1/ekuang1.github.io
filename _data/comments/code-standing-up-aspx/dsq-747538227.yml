message: <p>DanM is completely correct.  While there may be some benefit from stretching and standing occasionally, it's probably fairly alarmist to draw some of the conclusions that we tend to see on this topic.<br>There was a good discussion on reddit about this awhile ago and they pretty much came to the same conclusions that DanM did.</p>
