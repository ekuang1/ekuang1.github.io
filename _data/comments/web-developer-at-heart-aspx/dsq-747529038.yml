message: <p>I have to take a bit of an opposing view. I would argue it wasn't open source that made you a successful developer, but the sheer amount of time that you put into it.<br>A lot of studies have shown that it takes about 10K hours to get good at something. That's about five years of full time work. Spending time outside of the work day will get your 10,000 hours in faster.<br>It's all about time. I can never find the exact attribution for this quote, but a concert pianist said, "I practiced 12 hours a day for 20 years and now they call me a genius".<br>It wasn't Open Source that made you, Phil, it was your passion and effort. That makes you a success in any field.</p>
