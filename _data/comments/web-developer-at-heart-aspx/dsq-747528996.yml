message: <p>I could so derail this post with a messed up comment about... well nevermind :). Good on ya Phil - I was just thinking this exact thing today - Open Source is an amazing vehicle to:<br>1) Meet good people who are super smart<br>2) Learn some good stuph<br>3) Take what you've learned to contribute some good stuph and...<br>4) Make a name for yourselph<br>It's phunny but the guys who work on SubSonic (and phix a lot of bugs) are sooooooooo loved by the SubSonic community. They will appeal to *them* for pheature/bug phixes! Hrrrmph.<br>Can I be a committer yet? Oh yah - I need to submit a phew more patches - the next one involves some SubSonic love. Is that cool?</p>
