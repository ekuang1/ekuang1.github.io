message: "<p>I agree with KevDog.  Joining anything will not make you better at it.  Passion for what you do will.<br>Can't find something to join?  Make something for yourself.  Just write lots of code.<br>My #1 interview question:  What is the last thing you wrote for yourself?<br>People who write code just because they love to do it will learn a ton more no matter what platform / topology / etc.  Write lots and lots of code.<br></p>"
