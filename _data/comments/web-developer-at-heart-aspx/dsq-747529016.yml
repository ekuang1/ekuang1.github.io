message: <p>I always say, 'The state is the enemy.'  The more state you hold onto, the more troubles you get into.<br>State, unless strictly controlled (which is hard to do!), can result in unintended consequences when it gets out of alignment with what the developer believed it would be in.  It makes multithreaded code harder to build, test, and debug.  It sucks.  I do my best to keep as little state as possible within my classes, preferring to use "contexts", objects that wrap the state required for methods to function that are passed to the methods from the outside.<br>So, I agree definitely that keeping the least amount of state within your objects (and therefore application) is the best way to go.  Which means that web applications tend to be easier to develop.  <br>Except for HTML/CSS, which is a clusterf***.  The WPF model of having a rich variety of containers that control positioning is so superior to HTML.  Div, span, and table.  That's pretty much it.  And it sucks.  HTML needs a *ing reboot.  Trash it all and start from scratch.</p>
