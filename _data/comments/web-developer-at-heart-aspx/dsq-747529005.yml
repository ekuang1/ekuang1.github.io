message: <p>Hi Phil<br>Just want you to know that I had a very nice experience reading this post:) I totally agree with you regarding OSS, mostly because it enables us to work one something we really want to. We are driven and self motivated by the work we do in these projects. I’ve seen many developers grow while working on such projects. And I don’t think it’s a coincident that the famous guys in our community like Ayende, J. Miller, you, Hanselman, Kzu etc. have worked or working on OSS projects.<br>I believe that OSS can be a learning accelerator. You meet new problems, new technologies and new people. And when these meets, you never know what happens. <br>Great work!<br>Thanks<br>Gøran<br></p>
