message: <p>That actually looks pretty cool. I think it's going to take a while for anyone outside of the ASP.NET community to realize that C# is a programming language.<br>I don't mean that as a slam against the guys out there (I used to be one)... but when you live in the world of PHP and the like, transitioning over to .NET takes a while to think oh-so-slightly out of the box.<br>Basically my advice to Josh would have been... "If your function would work in a Console application displaying your results to the screen, then it will work with ASP.NET MVC."</p>
