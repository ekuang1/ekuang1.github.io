message: <p>@Pat Good to see you blogging, man! Yeah, I think overall Joel is still worth reading. If nothing for the excitement to see what inflammatory thing he says.<br>Seriously though, the guy is crazy smart and has good things to say. The fact that he's opinionated is a good thing. It's good to check your own assumptions sometimes. So while I think he's wrong on some things, he forces me to think hard about why I think he's wrong.<br>At the same time, he's right about a lot more things.</p>
