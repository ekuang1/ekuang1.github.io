message: <p>I miss the old Joel. A lot of the older content on his site is great, and I love his writing style, but lately it's become the FogBugz Marketing Blog. When there is content, it's often something I can't get behind, like the one where he stated his need to develop his own language and compiler, or this one. <br>The theory that automated testing is without merit because it can't prove a GUI is usable or that code is flawless, doesn't really make sense to me. <br>I would post this in Joel's comments, but he doesn't want to hear from the readers, so I posted it here since your reaction was similar to mine.</p>
