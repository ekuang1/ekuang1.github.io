message: <p>I still think that Joel is fun to read, but the bigger problem is that he hasn't written any decent length articles in a while.<br>A lot of his site has become a marketing blog for FogBugz, but at least he still tries to relate it back to improving software development practices.<br>I guess his lack of posting give me more time to read things like Haacked and Coding Horror.</p>
