That would be outlandish.</blockquote><p><br>I'm still wrapping my head around TDD but I think the proof that it gives you is that: Given X, Y must be true. Where X is your input and Y is your output. I can't prove that my code is correct but I can prove that my result is correct when X = 1. I don't think that TDD proves code correctness, it proves result correctness.</p>"
