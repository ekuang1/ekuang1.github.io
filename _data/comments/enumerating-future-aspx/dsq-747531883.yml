message: <p>I saw the Rx talk by Eric Meijer at MIX10. It was probably one of the coolest talks I saw there, apart from the MVC talks you gave :P<br>I was super excited about this, but also had a hard time understanding how it would fit into my existing code. I really want to look into refactoring the jQuery UI autocomplete plugin to use Rx, as I've experienced exactly what Eric shows when dealing with autocompletes.</p>
