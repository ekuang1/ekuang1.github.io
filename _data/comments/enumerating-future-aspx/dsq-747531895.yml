message: <p>Thanks for this post! Although not the point of it, I now have a better understanding of 'yield return'. Now I have to run ILDASM and see what the difference is between 'x.Find(x =&gt; x.y == z)' and its foreach+yield-return counter THEN begin thinking about ways to apply Reactive Extensions!<br>This is what I get for not sleeping tonight?!? thanks Phil :P ;)</p>
