message: <p>This is really a tossup between just having enough power to either shut everything down, or keeping things running long enough to p*ss all the neibours off. Basically its between the strength and power of the inverteers, because as soon as the battery's go, Im going with dual deep discharge marine.<br>First up:<br><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16842101343" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16842101343">www.newegg.com/.../Product.aspx</a><br>and second up:<br><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/BEST-Fortress-LI1420VA-BT-Battery-Backup-System-UPS-/290564436393?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item43a6fd71a9" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/BEST-Fortress-LI1420VA-BT-Battery-Backup-System-UPS-/290564436393?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item43a6fd71a9">cgi.ebay.com/.../290564436393</a><br>Now, I *know* the fortress system goes for about $750 new, and all the rest of its components are first rate. but its twice the cost of the APS unit. ( and probably 2x the shipping costs ).<br></p>
