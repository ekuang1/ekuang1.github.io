message: <p>I've currently got 2 UPS appliances. Both are APC. <br><br><br><br>I use one to backup my two servers (a PII &amp; PIII) and a wireless access point, all tucked in our laundry closet.  Both of the servers are are just a tower with a power cord and network cable. I think that UPS is rated around 500VA, and I only get about 12 minutes of up-time. However, the main server is hooked up to the UPS via USB, so it gets shutdown when there is 15% power left. Unfortunatly the other server isn't so lucky and it just gets a hard power off when the UPS is depleted, unless I get a chance to remote in and shut it down manually.<br><br><br><br>The other UPS is hooked up to my power-hungy P4 workstation. I've got dual 7200rmp HDDs, 1 external HDD, a 17" LCD, plus the broadband modem and router all running off this one. It is rated at 900VA and according to the PowerChute software I've got about 30 minutes of up-time with this configuration. I have this machine setup to shutdown when 50% battery power is remaining.<br><br><br><br>We've only had the power go out for more than a few minutes once... it was out for about 2 hrs. With the modem and (wireless) router are also running off the second UPS we still had internet access the whole time... using my g/f's laptop.</p>
