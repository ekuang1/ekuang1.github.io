message: <p>I've got a APC something or another. $45 shipped from <a href="http://newegg.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="newegg.com">newegg.com</a>:<br><br><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16842101124" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16842101124">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16842101124</a><br><br><br><br>It works fine by me (though I work on a kitchen-sink-replacement laptop all the time at home - so I only use the UPS for my external HDs - which I run my Virtual Machines on and don't want to lose in the middle of anything). The software seems a tiny bit sluggish on startup some times - otherwise it's fine, lightweight, etc. and will instruct my machine to hibernate based on a couple of simple profiles (i.e. do i want to keep my machine/stuff running as long as possible before powering down, or do i want to conserve battery and power down almost immediately - either way my stuff gets saved).</p>
