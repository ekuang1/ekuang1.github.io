message: <p>Be aware that some UPS units have the battery date encoded internally and when it reaches a certain age (3yrs in the case of the APC/Conext CNB950) the frustration begins.  I put in new batteries, but the UPS still reports the original age.  Shutdown manger won't work right because it thinks available minutes are "- -".  So I have to run with the USB unplugged.  Still trying to get this resolved, but support is terrible.  No more APC or Conext for me after this unit is gone - which could be any moment.</p>
