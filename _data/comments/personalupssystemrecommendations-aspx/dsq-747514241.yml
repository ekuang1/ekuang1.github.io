message: <p>I was using a Sola Desktop UPS and an APC unit as well, i am now using a Jentec Stepping UPS. The Jentec is 2.0 KVA, but due to its stepping ability can actually be 1.8 to 2.2 depending on the load. <br><br><br><br>I was put on to Jentec by some clients who where unhappy with how much the APC units are in Australia. We ended up ordering these units in bulk and getting a good discount.<br><br><br><br>Software wise, the APC is the best, the rest suck. I now don't use any software, as i find the power is back before its needed.<br><br><br><br>On my UPS i have my ADSL router, 3 network switches, a dual Xeon server and another machine.<br><br><br><br>Remember, the low quality UPS units are usually that, and often don't work as expected.</p>
