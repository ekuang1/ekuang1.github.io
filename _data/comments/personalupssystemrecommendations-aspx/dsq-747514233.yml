message: <p>I have several (2 currently running).  I just bought a Conext for about $30 from CompUSA that works great.  I live in Dunedin (Tampa Bay), FLwhere it seems at least once or twice a day the power blinks.  The battery backup is nice because they keep everything up.  BTW, the real question is how long does your power stay off... I wouldn't expect my UPS to last for more than an hour or so (although both are rated for 2 hours... lot of good it does you with no monitor).  The longer you need to make sure the computer stays up the more money you will be paying out.</p>
