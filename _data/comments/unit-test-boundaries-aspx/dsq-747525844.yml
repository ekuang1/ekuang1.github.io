message: '<p>There few definition for unit for you. Choose one and find out if your unit test is a "real unit" Test.<br>- unit of measurement: any division of quantity accepted as a standard of measurement or exchange; "the dollar is the United States unit of currency ...<br>- an individual or group or structure or other entity regarded as a structural or functional constituent of a whole; "the reduced the number of units and installations"; "the word is a basic linguistic unit" <br>- an organization regarded as part of a larger social group; "the coach said the offensive unit did a good job"; "after the battle the soldier had trouble rejoining his unit" <br>- a single undivided whole; "an idea is not a unit that can be moved from one brain to another" <br>a single undivided natural thing occurring in the composition of something else; "units of nucleic acids" <br>- whole: an assemblage of parts that is regarded as a single entity; "how big is that part compared to the whole?"; "the team is a unit" <br>Myself i think you cant categorize what is and what is not a real unit test. You are trying to force your ideal of a unit test when in reality a "unit" has no single definition.<br>So is short.<br>In your world your unit tests are only unit tests if they dont cross boundaries, you are capping the tested percentage of your application by leaving other parts untested. leaving connectors untested. <br>are you trying to imply that should be a framework to test the code integration? let say class A using Class B?</p>'
