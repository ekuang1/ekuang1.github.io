message: <p>For those of you that think unit test can cross boundaries, I would like to pose a question.<br>If the Database, Web or FTP server is down, do you fail the unit test?<br>My answer is the test would be inconclusive. I am a huge believer that unit test should not cross boundaries only integration tests should. Just my humble opinion.</p>
