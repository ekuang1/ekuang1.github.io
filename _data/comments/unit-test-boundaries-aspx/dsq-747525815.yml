message: <p>Like Francois, I'm not saying automated tests that check the logic in a stored proc are not valuable. They just aren't considered *unit* tests. <br>TDD for example, is a design activity focused on the design of your code, test coverage is a byproduct. Testing your stored procs sounds more like a *testing* activity, and you can put those tests either in your database itself, or in a separate test suite for integration tests.<br>You really really really want your *unit* tests to run blazing fast. But there's a lot <a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2005/10/18/UnitTestingLovesBetaTestingAndViceVersa.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="unit testing loves beta testing">more to testing your app than unit tests</a>.</p>
