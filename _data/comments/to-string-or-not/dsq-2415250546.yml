So we're deceiving ourselves if we think we're doing anything other than just making up whatever we feel works for us.  And there's nothing wrong with that at all.  Do what works for you and your team!</p><p>I have never said that we should follow any "holy writ".</p><p>Simply be aware that looking around for justifications to back up your existing preferences - and ignoring them when you don't agree is something called "Confirmation Bias".</p>
