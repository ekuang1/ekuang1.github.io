message: <p>I agree, it helps with readability in a significant way for me. As I said in a comment above, every time I have to stop and process the code, instead of just reading it, those little pauses add up, just as you say. And it isn't so much that I've simply gotten used to it. I've worked at jobs where they mandated a style contrary to my preference, and I've gotten used to it, and those pauses to process have gotten smaller. But as soon as I have the choice, I revert to lowercase type usage, and uppercase class usage, simply because for me it just makes sense.</p>
