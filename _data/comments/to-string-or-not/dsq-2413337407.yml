message: <p>Alright. Fair point on DateTime dependencies - it may end up being more complex after all (didn't measure but I can see it would be possible). Still, I don't think is a valid argument for not having a `datetime` alias... All other structs do, String is a class... And yet it deserves an alias? Not buying.</p>
