message: <p>Sorry - cannot agree with you.  I prefer consistency over "mixing it up".  Lowercase everywhere for me.  Uppercase feels a little jarring.</p><p>Have always found it interesting how we developers will point to coding guidelines to support our position when we agree, but disregard them and call them "wrong" when we don't.</p><p>Next, can we talk about brace positioning?  Or implicitly typed local variables?  :-)</p>
