message: <p>It isn't hard to understand why we use coding guidelines as an Appeal To Authority, because without it then it's just an argument of opinion. Religious debates go nowhere. Debates with something to refer to as more authoritative are more substantive as you have someone who ostensibly "knows better".</p><p>The flip side to that coin is that really it all comes down to preference to a large degree, and I doubt any of us will find a coding standard that we completely agree with. It's about readability, which is different for different people. But there *are* some baselines. You don't open any published book and see inconsistent paragraph spacing. Same with "good" code, it's consistent and follows the logical baselines that nearly everyone can agree on as qualifying as clean code.</p><p>The third side of that two-sided coin is that whenever referring to Microsoft documentation for coding/naming guidelines, you have to understand that MS is a big company with lots of teams and lots of egos, and they don't even have a single coding standard that everyone in the company follows. The P&amp;P team (or whoever) can release all the recommendations they want, but you're still going to find code in MS products that doesn't follow those conventions.</p>
