message: <p>A DateTime has properties on it (like .Year, .Month, etc), which makes it more conceptually a complex type rather than a primitive IMHO.</p><p>The "primitive" types feel appropriate to me for things that can be initialized with a literal, e.g. <code>int foo = 12</code> or <code>string bar = "baz"</code>.</p>
