message: <p>So glad I am not the only one who feels this away about things that really shouldn't matter! I hate when I see string.IsNullOrEmpty(...) instead of String.IsNullOrEmpty(...).One says this is a static method and the other is saying a primitive is not just a primitive. Great to see others see code as communication to others in addition to the compiler :-)</p>
