message: <p>Yes, yes, and yes again! I've been mandating or pushing for this exact same convention at every job I've worked at since. NET came out (~15 years). Lowercase int is a primitive type, use it as such. Int32 is a class, use it as such. Method calls on a lowercase word that has syntax highlighting make me stop reading the code and switch into analysis mode to see how far the Java/Javascript syntax "infestation" has spread. I hate it. </p>
