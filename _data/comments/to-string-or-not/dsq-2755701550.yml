message: <p>No.  When developers overwhelmingly use lowercase string/int/etc for their primitives (which they do), then it's definitely *not* consistent to sometimes use lowercase string and sometimes uppercase.  Phil himself said that these primitives feel special (an opinion I share) - lowercase in all the codes ... not just sometimes.</p>
