message: <p>i could agree on String, but if we have a mix of int and Int32.Parse, Int32.MinValue in code, this i don't like. Obviously i would not write my int as Int32 in code to keep parity! Plus you have to add a using statement of System to your code. So for me it is string.Empty and int.MaxValue. My 2 cents</p>
