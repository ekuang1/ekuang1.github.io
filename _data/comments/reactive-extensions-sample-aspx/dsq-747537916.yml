message: <p>I've been working on a Scala project recently in my job and there is a new thing in the Scala world called Iteratees which are essentially what Rx is all about.  Odd thing is the Scala world appear to be lapping them up - yet I feel the .NET world is still keeping Rx on the side lines.  Probably because of the more functional nature of Scala over C# they feel more natural to the developer.  That said Rx does appear to be gaining some steady momentum recently - hopefully it will continue.<br></p>
