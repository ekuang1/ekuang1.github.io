message: <p>Very nice.  :)<br><br><br><br>For my own part, I think there was at least a little bit of insecurity involved in the selection of my blog subtitle. In my embarassment over being unable to come up with anything even remotely clever as a subtitle at all due to my lack of a creative mind, I think my subconscious pushed me in the direction of trying to overcome that inadequacy by putting something there that would give me at least a small sense of superiority over those who would read my blog and have absolutely no idea what that subtitle meant.<br><br><br><br>How's that for an excuse?  heh<br><br><br><br>I will also admit though, that I was significantly flattered by the implication that you're subscribed to my blog.  :)</p>
