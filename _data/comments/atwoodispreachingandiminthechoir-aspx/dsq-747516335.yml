message: <p>I disagree with Barry on this one. I think one of the main selling points of Tortoise is that it doesn't try to pretend that your code isn't a bunch of files stored on your disk.<br>I like the simplicity of keeping source control and file operations in one place. It's nice to be able to right click a file and check it in.</p>
