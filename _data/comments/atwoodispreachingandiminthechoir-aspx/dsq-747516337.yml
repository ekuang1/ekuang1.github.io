message: <p>We use it at work, well because its the standard.  Not too much choice there.  We could experiment with Team Server but why?  SS is not perfect but it works, kind of.    Of course there are only 2 of use that use it so that simplifies things.  I used Source forge in a large environment and it was no better.  There were all sorts of problems with people checking things out and what to upload at promotion time.  That was with 100+ people though.</p>
