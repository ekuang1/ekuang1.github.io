message: <p>We experienced several issues that finally encouraged us to switch to Subversion as well as the new process methodologies encouraged by Subversion:<br>1. We lost approximately 60 revisions in some projects when Visual SourceUnsafe wrote empty files into the repository. I don't mean it checked in empty files, I mean the actual underlying files in the repository itself were zero bytes.<br>2. We had several instances in which SourceUnsafe failed to check in all files for variouos reasons. This was a mess because it required developers to very carefully and cautiously check out files (without getting latest) so they could check in changes.<br>2. There's no way to lock down the repository to prevent unwanted tampering with the repository.<br>3. Tracking releases was difficult because (honestly) we lacked the discipline to "label" every release. There were also conflicts with new changes being made before we had a chance to "label" a clean revision. Even so, I find the labels a bit tacky because they are lumped in with thousands of check ins.<br>4. No easy way to perform code reviews by comparing diffs from the base. It can be done, but it's a pain to diff against each revision one file at a time. It's not nearly as neat as svn blame, a diff against the base, or a unified diff.<br>We have been running Subversion on a Linux server with Apache and SSL access for several months and the difference is tremendous. However, I should point out that we officially migrated our SourceUnsafe repository to Subversion right after Subversion released the FSFS repository. I'm glad we did because it mitigates all the compatibility issues with the Berkely Database.<br>It also took me a while (by experimenting on a local Subversion repository) to get the hang of the branch and merge methodology, but I love it and we actually have tags for every release we've done over the past year. Not just stinky labels, but real tags.<br>The most significant relief in my mind is the transactional approach to commits. If Tortoise or Subversions says the files are committed, the files are committed.<br></p>
