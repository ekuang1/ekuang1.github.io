message: <p>Phil, I never understood why the method ShouldShow checks if the model is not a "complex type". I'm having problems today because of this check, so I'm workarounding by adding a fake string type converter to my model, so it is "masked as a simple type". However, this has caused me other side effects as well, so I'm a bit lost on this. Could you explain why EditorForModel() won't render the templates for "complex types"?<br>Thanks,<br>Felipe</p>
