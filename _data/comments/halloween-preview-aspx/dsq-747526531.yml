message: <p>Hey Phil,<br>Great looking boys you have there and an awesome set of "disguises" :)<br>They going to get a ton of value out of those suits for sure. My kids recently has a ballet concert, where they played a banana and a baby elefant in the Jungle Book (they're 5 and 2 btw).<br>They're still having a ball in those costumes and i suspect yours will too. Just one piece of advice/warning - do NOT let them wear it out for a shopping spree - consider yourself warned :)<br>Cute kids Phil (and yes, dads are allowed to call their kids cute too regardless of what people at the rugby club says)!</p>
