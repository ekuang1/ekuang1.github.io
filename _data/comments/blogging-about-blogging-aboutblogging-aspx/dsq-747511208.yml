message: <p>There is certainly no shortage of e-mails about e-mailing (I get them from my office telling me what is and what is not appropriate to write in e-mails), though I don't run accross many faxes about faxing.  Would anyone be critical about writing about blogging (as we are seeing more and more in the newspaper) or blogging about writing (a blog by a writer for example), or are such cross-medium publications acceptable?</p>
