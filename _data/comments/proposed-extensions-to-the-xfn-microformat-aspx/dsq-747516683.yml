message: <p>I'm curious; Ben, wouldn't you technically currently be a <em>pre</em>-dant?<br>A couple other tags you missed;<br>Hater</p><blockquote>Never approves of any action, by anyone, ever</blockquote><p><br>Playa</p><blockquote>Very adept at acquiring companionship of a romantic or lustful nature</blockquote><p><br>You could use both tags to describe an offensive person from your previous night out who prevented you from making the connection.<br>And, of course, using Ben's example, you could use both tags with the accompanying "rev" to describe someone who either assisted you in making a connection, or <em>was</em> your connection if either tag (or both) apply to you...<br>P.S. Phil; your preview (and perhaps your comment form) doesn't recognize &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;. Probably your incessant need to be XHTML compliant. Perhaps there's a nice way to reformat &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; for us stubborn folk?<br>Just a thought. And no, I can't do it. Even if I wanted to...</p>
