message: <p>Definately like the new purposed ideas.  The friends-4-ever is interesting since with MySpace it seems a lot of people think their buddy list is to be a global directory of everyone that they ever knew, will know or might know.  So I think maybe add:<br>Who-Knows<br> <br>For those people who you think you know but maybe really don't.<br></p>
