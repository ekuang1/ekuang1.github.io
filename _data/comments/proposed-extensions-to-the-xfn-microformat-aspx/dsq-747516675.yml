message: <p>Really, this doesn't have to be part of XFN to be used.  It doesn't even have to be a Microformat to be used.<br>Things like what you proposed (and XFN and Microformats) are all just Semantic HTML.<br>And ANYONE can create their own Semantic HTML.<br>(You don't need to ask anyone for permission to create your own Semantic HTML.  And you don't need to get anyone's approval to create your own Semantic HTML.)<br>Microformats are just Semantic HTML with a specification (created though the <a href="http://Microformats.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Microformats.org">Microformats.org</a> group).<br><br>-- Charles<br></p>
