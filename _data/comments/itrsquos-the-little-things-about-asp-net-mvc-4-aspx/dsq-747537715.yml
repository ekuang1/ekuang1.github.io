message: <p>I posted the article about the Service Locator being an anti-pattern.  It totally is, not sure what someone is smoking, but Mark Seemann HIGHLY in his book AND on the Stackoverflow posting of mine IS VERY AGAINST IT.  Please re-read his book, and the Stackoverflow posting to those who think that they really understand what is being said, what is the science and not merely some opinion by someone with a big ego</p>
