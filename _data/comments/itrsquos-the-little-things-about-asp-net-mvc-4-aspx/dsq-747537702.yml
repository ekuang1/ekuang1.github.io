message: "<p>@Josh: Mark Seeman does say that Service Location is an anti-pattern, he does it on his blog and here in an interview on InfoQ (<a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/articles/DI-Mark-Seemann\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.infoq.com/articles/DI-Mark-Seemann\">http://www.infoq.com/articles/DI-Mark-Seemann</a>): \"which again leads to the Service Locator anti-pattern\". I haven't read his book but I'd exepct him to support this claim in the book too. Also what is even worse Mark says \"DI also solves all of the problems that Service Locator claims to solve, so thereâ€™s absolutely no reason to ever use a Service Locator.\" which is totally in conflict with what you say (and I agree with your opinion, not Mark's). It is really surprising that someone who writes a book about Depenedency Injection has such narrow view of the subject. So to sum up, YES Mark Seeman does claim that Service Location is an anti-pattern and is thus doing a bad service to the community with this opinion and that's why people get confused ask such questions i.e. here on Phil's blog since Phil is very respected.</p>"
