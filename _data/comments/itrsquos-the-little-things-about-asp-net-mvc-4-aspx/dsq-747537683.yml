message: <p>@Phil - Thanks for your opinion on service locator in ASP.NET MVC.<br>@Josh - I never "chided" anyone. I respect Phil's opinions and simply asked for his thoughts on the question posed on SO. I never said that I endorse the opinion expressed by the poster of the SO question either. I also follow Mark Seamann's blog and know his opinions regarding resolving dependencies at the composition root, so please do not infer my intent or my knowledge of service locators based on my question posed to Phil.</p>
