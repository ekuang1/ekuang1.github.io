message: "<p>Phil,<br>Great how you related what you tried before to the new stuff in ASP.NET MVC 4. Nice write up :)<br>For others findings, there is one thing not specific to ASP.NET MVC 4, but I discovered it when trying ASP.NET MVC 4 out in VS 11. Some helper file for JS intellisense named '_References.js'. I wrote about it here: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/_referencesjs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://bit.ly/_referencesjs\">http://bit.ly/_referencesjs</a></p>"
