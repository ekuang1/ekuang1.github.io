message: <p>So, is the image stablization just a side affect of having a very high iso?  or is there more to it than that.<br>I'm in the market.  My biggest complain is how my little optio pentax camera handles indoor pictures with out a flash (more than 10 feet). How does it do with that?  any samples?<br></p>
