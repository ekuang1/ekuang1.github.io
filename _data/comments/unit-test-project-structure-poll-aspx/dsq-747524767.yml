message: <p>If you're really really doing TDD with near 100% coverage, your tests will only bloat your assembly if included in the same project/assembly.<br>So my answer above was to put unit tests in a separate project, though I dunno if there's a way to split assemblies within a project. Point is your tests shouldn't be in the same assembly.</p>
