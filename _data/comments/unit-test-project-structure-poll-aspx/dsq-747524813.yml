message: "<p>I name my tests using the following pattern: &lt;unit under test&gt;Test.cs|java.  Because of this, I can use an alphabetized view to quickly assess what has unit tests and what does not.<br>I actually don't care where my unit tests are physically located as long as the IDE gives me a view that lets me see a list of units under test and their corresponding unit test right next to each other.  I want to easily identify if someone dropped a unit in that needs testing (or split a class into two).<br>This seems to mean putting the unit tests in the same assembly when I'm using Visual Studio.  Assembly bloat has never been even close enough to be a concern.  Besides, you want to be careful about optimizing on the wrong thing.  The most expensive thing about software is the developer (way more expensive than disk space), so you want them to be working as effectively as possible.<br>In Eclipse, I use the package view so I can see my units and their corresponding tests side by side as long as they are declared in the same namespace/package.  If you're building under Maven, it will automatically strip out the test classes so if you were to worry about the drop-in-the-bucket issue of code bloat, it will be gone.</p>"
