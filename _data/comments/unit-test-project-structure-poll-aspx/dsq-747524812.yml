message: "<p>I like keeping unit tests in the same project, but I think that's due to my exposure to Java and Rails where it's painless to strip them out of any production packages (assemblies in the dotnet context).<br>Maven also enables test-scoped dependencies, so adding a reference to  a unit testing framework doesn't cause any deployment-time problems.<br>However, for \"integration\" tests, I put them in their own project.<br>In the current <a href=\"http://ASP.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"ASP.net\">ASP.net</a> MVC experimental project I'm doing, I've followed the Visual Studio convention of having a separate project for unit tests, though it messes with my head a bit.<br>Generally, I just try to follow the conventions of the particular environment I'm using, unless those conventions suck. For example, in ruby/rails I use this_naming_convention_for_methods but I use TheDotNetStyle when writing stuff in C#, and theCamelCaseStyle for methods in Java, just because it's idiomatic in those worlds and looks wrong when I break the rules. The same with unit testing: If the way it's usually done in VS doesn't cause me trouble, I'll do it that way.</p>"
