message: "<p>I am all about having the tests in a different project with one caveat.  When I start developing a class I have the tests for it in the same file to speed up TDD.  This quickly moves out as soon as I feel comfortable with what I am working with.  This allows quick development of the item and R# really helps with the moving of the item out on it's own.<br>Actually, we use several test libraries. We also use several assemblies for the solution that tie down to...function (or some natural point of separation). Each project gets it's own test project.  So if we have Organization.Solution.Project, we have Organization.Solution.Project.Tests.  <br>What goes in these projects are logical tests.<br>Then, with anything that touches external things to the code goes to a project that is named in this format: Organization.Solution.Tests.Integration.<br>These are what we define as integration external to the system. Do I have to read from a file? Touch a database? Call a Web Service? We test that we can actually do this here.</p>"
