message: <p>I have done it the in both ways. Before recent days, I kept my test codes in the same assembly and manually edited the csproj files to conditionally include the files containing test codes. This way it worked for simple assemblies.<br>However, Presently I favor the separate assembly approach, since it makes it easy to deploy and separates the two concerns.</p>
