message: <p>I agree with others here, test in a seperate assembly project.  I do it mostly for cleanliness and keeping references down in the main project, plus it really makes me think about my external API, my future-self and other developers will also be using my objects "from the outside" so I want to test from the outside.<br>Also, TDD isn't *just* about testing, it's about using your framework before it's built to help you hammer out real-life usages, naming conventions and object interactions.  It's about getting a feel for how others will interact with your classes and testing from the inside blurs that line.</p>
