message: <p>I post in a separate assembly for one reason, to remove reliance on Nunit/mbunit/nspecify assemblies, which has bitten me before when it came to deployment.<br>Also i will generally add an assembly:InternalsVisibleTo so that i can test internal methods, which is one of the reasons I used to have tests in the same assembly.<br>Cheers<br>O</p>
