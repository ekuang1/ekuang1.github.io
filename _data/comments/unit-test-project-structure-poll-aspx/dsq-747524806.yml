message: <p>One follow up...I didn't really explain why I would want to keep things in one file for a short amount of time.  This is so I keep all of my focus right there and not have to go back and forth between files. Plus I know I am done working with the class (in the short interim) when I have moved the tests out to there own file, copied that file down to it's test project and removed the newly created file.</p>
