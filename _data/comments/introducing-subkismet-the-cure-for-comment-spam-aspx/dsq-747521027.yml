Would be neat to add a lookup there for any recognised URL in the comments and flag it as bad.<br>Would love to see this integrated into <a href="http://BlogEngine.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="BlogEngine.net">BlogEngine.net</a> ... have you had a word with them, or submitted it as a patch?</p>
