message: <p>I remember my dreams everynight. Alot of the time, I have up to five nightmares a night.<br>I don't think it's common. I've heard it is common in young children, but I am 18 years old. Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy. lol.<br>I get really bad "Dream Hangovers" too.<br>And on rare occassions, my dreams come true.<br>Anyone going through the same thing?<br>lol.</p>
