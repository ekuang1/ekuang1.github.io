message: <p>I have teeth dreams all the time. The suckers just fall out left and right and there's nothing I can do about it. It's almost like that in real life except instead of falling out the suckers just crack and require $$$ for crowns.<br><br><br><br>In the dreams at least, the dental work is free.</p>
