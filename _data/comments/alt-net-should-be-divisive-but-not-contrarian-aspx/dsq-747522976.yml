message: <p>I'm not at all surprised at Sam's actions.  He merely echoes a sentiment I've heard around the developer community even outside of the blogosphere when talking to people at user groups and events.  <br>ALT.NET is perceived as being anti-Microsoft because of a few bloggers' overzealous nature in describing their disdain for Microsoft products and all things anti-Agile.  This is really quite sad, considering ScottGu is presenting the debut of the Microsoft MVC framework at the ALT.NET conf tomorrow.</p>
