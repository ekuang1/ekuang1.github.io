message: <p>&gt; I take offense to how he labeled the <a href="http://alt.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="alt.net">alt.net</a> community as being "full of negative energy", and "sneering". <br>The spokespeople like Bellware and Jeremy and others are full of negative energy and putting down people that don't do it their way. Maybe you need new spokespeople that don't attack Microsoft and others every other day.<br>I know my post may seem very negative and it came out a lot more than I wanted but there is a strong message there that there is value in architecture and other activities.I find it interesting that you label me "Very negative" and my blog but you have no problem with people like Bellware saying "Microsoft, you are deeply, deeply pathetic. I'm endlessly amazed at the effort you put into crafting such screwy software." <br>Anyway, this will go into personal attacks and places I don't want to go. I don't want to discuss this any further.</p>
