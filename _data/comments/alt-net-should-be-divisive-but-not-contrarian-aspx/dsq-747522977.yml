message: <p>I wish they make the videos of the discussions available soon because there has definitely been a lot of synergy in the air. Sure there were the mandatory rants by the usual suspects, but in the end it was very well described by one of the participants as "tough love".<br>Rest assured that the discussions have been, for the better part, focused on genuinely improving our work, whatever that means. I has been also an important validator for the attending crowd and Microsoft (I hope).</p>
