message: <p>@Chuck Ruby on Rails is nothing new. It repackages MVC for the web using Ruby, a language that's been around as long as Java.<br>But it's still very notable and worthy of attention. <br>You dismiss "repackaging" as if it's trivial and unimportant, but it's not. Packaging is extremely important and is what helps ideas gain traction. Sure these ideas have been around a long time, but the lack of developers applying the principles hints that there may be a need to repackage them.</p>
