message: <p>I think ALT.NET is only a movement for people who have spent years implementing Microsoft-only solutions. Possibly it's the discovery that there is a big, bright world outside of Microsoft and the smartest people don't necessarily live in Redmond. When I first heard the moniker, this is kind of what I thought about the "movement". I never perceived it to be negative in any way, shape, or form. I always saw it as a group looking to spread their wings a bit.</p>
