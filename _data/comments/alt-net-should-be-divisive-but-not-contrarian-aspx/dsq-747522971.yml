message: <p>I personally found Sam's goodbye post to be very negative itself. <br>I take offense to how he labeled the <a href="http://alt.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="alt.net">alt.net</a> community as being "full of negative energy", and "sneering". I used to subscribe to Sam's blog as well but find him very negative. I recently took him off my blog list as I found no value in reading his blog anymore.<br>I for one admire what Microsoft has done thus far. It is truly amazing. I do not label people as "morts" or even claim that they are doing things wrong. I simply feel that there is a better way to do things. Microsoft may have brought us this far, but there comes a time when you do look for other "alternative" ways to do things.<br>People simply have different views and understandings of things. If Sam believes the <a href="http://alt.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="alt.net">alt.net</a> community to be negative then I wish him the best of luck in other areas.</p>
