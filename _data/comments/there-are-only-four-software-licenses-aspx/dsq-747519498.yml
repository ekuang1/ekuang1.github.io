message: "<p>Hmm. How about those enigmatic licenses that Microsoft uses? Windows Media Player circa 2002: \"We own whatever hardware you install this software onto, and all the hardware that comes after it, and all the hardware that ever enters the houses on your block, too. Forever. Unless the hadware is made by Apple Computer.\". Or their \"If I show you the license, I'd have to go back in time to kill your maternal grandmother\" license which is the license seen after you open the Windows full installation package and you read that by opening the package, you already indentured you first 3 offspring into servitude.</p>"
