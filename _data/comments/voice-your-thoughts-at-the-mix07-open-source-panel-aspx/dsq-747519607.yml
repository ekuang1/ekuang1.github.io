message: <p>I hope the discussions continue beyond Mix, Rob and Miguel are stewards of the the OSS .NET world no doubt and the other panel members have a wealth of OSS experince. However I would love to see others from the OSS .NET world get involved beyond the panel (folks like you Phil) as I think this kind of discussion is wider than 6 people.</p>
