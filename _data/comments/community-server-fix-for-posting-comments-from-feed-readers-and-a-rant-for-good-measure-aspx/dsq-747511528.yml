message: <p>Clicking on the DasBlog link comes back w/ this message?<br><br><br><br>Due to issues with the blogging software I was using, I have been instructed to suspend this service.<br><br><br><br>I am looking at alternative software solutions so that "Das Blog" can continue. Please check back soon<br><br><br><br>Steve. <br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br>I really wish they'd have gotten it right on the initial release; they've now scared a ton of .Text users off to other blogs as they're afraid A).Text will no longer be supported (doesn't really matter as it works pretty well, plus the source is pretty straightforward for anyone wishing to make mods) and B)that Telligent may never get it 100% (though I know for a fact 1.1 is gonna be much more stable, more details about that later on).<br><br><br><br>My next big personal project w/ CS is to make a "Diet CS" version for single bloggers like us.  I could probably pare the DB in half, and get the codebase down to perhaps 2/3 what it is now, though there is a lot of reliance on the Forums code for the blogging part (!?!).  The coolest thing about CS is they way it handles Url rewriting though; as a web dev you should at least have a look at how they do it...very extensible and flexible.<br><br><br><br>Several times I swore I was going back to .Text, so my advice to anyone looking to jump to CS, just stay w/ .Text for now and have a look at 1.1 when it comes out (which should be within a month or so).</p>
