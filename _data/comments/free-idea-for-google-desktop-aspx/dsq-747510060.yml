message: <p>I read in a newspaper (Seattle times, October 19, 2004) that Google Desktop archives and can search web-based e-mail (I assume this includes G-mail).  The article made the point that one should be careful to use a public computer (library, internet cafe) with Google Desktop search installed as the next user could then read the web-based e-mail sent by the prior user.</p>
