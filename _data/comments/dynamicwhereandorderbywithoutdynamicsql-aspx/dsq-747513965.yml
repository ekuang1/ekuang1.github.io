message: <p>The problem is that SQL sucks and the people that are set to handle SQL completely refuse to add anything useful to the standard. (Celko?)<br>What we need is for SQL to add dynamic where, dynamic order by in an easy and optmized way, we also need arrays, vectors whatever you want to call it.<br>It's time to mondernize SQL !</p>
