message: <p>Thanks for the reminder Phil. Since I'm still new to development and learning inside the halls of msft, it's extremely easy for me to have the "borgitude."<br><br><br><br>In particular, I'm really feeling the pain around source control right now. We use an internal tool called Source Depot which might (I'm not sure) be a knock-off/upgrade to VSS. We only have 2 developers on our team and yet we are constantly battling source control issues. It's so damned frustrating! I'll have to look into Subversion (by the way, your link to the Subversion post is broken).</p>
