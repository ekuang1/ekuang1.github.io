message: <p>It's not just newbie devs that are averse to Subversion. I've got a 7-year Visual Studio senior SDE from Microsoft telling me we have to put at lock on files in our Subversion repository when we check them out. <br><br><br><br>What always amazes me most is how some people view Microsoft and Open Source as mutualy exclusive. Some of the best Open Source software is written for the Microsoft platform. I was able to move my weblogs from a Linux platform to a Win2K3 host due to PHP and MySQL being cross-platform.<br><br><br><br>I have another friend, an ex-softie, that mocks me whenever I talk about my Windows box being unstable because I "install all that third party software and shareware".<br><br><br><br>I used to be a staunch Microsoft defender and enthusiast, because they made the best piece of crap out there. Now, that's not really the case.</p>
