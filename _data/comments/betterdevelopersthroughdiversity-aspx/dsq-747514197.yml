message: <p>Just 2 short comments:<br>1. SourceSafe is not free. The retail price of single user license is about USD$500. It may be included in your MSDN subscription. But different MSDN subscription plan comes with different thing. You have paid it. :)<br>2. There are several other VSS remote access tools. As I know, SourceAnyWhere is better. It supports SSL, Eclipse plug-in and even has a cache server. <br><a href="http://www.dynamsoft.com/Products/SAW_Overview.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.dynamsoft.com/Products/SAW_Overview.aspx">http://www.dynamsoft.com/Pr...</a><br>Just some thoughts.</p>
