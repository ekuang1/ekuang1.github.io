message: <p>I so completely agree, and second what Adam said about credit card numbers. Most websites I buy from require that credit card numbers be digits only with no punctuations separating the grouping of four or five digits. Those groupings reduce typing errors and increase the ability for humans to catch errors by visual scanning. As a former web ecommerce merchant, I know that every time a user submitted an order with an typing error there was a good chance we'd ultimately loose the order (for a variety of reasons.)  So the irony is sites that disallow punctuation with credit cards are increasing the number of potential lost sales from incorrectly typed credit card numbers.</p>
