message: <p>How far is is worth taking your validation is a separate issue to whether or not a address can be validated against the RFCs.<br>Personally I use email address validation to teach students the futility of attempting to check the accuracy of data by checking structure alone â€” but I've still had to work out an expression that can validate addresses against the RFCs for when I'm asked if it can actually be done.<br>On OUR website we've recently added an email confirmation field, annoying for some perhaps but it has drastically reduced the number of undeliverable emails that were by and large resulting from careless typing.</p>
