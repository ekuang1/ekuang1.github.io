message: <p>Being from NZ, I must concur with this. Plus you get all the weird and wonderful "standard" ways different people who expect a country code expect (allow) it to be entered, yet in my experience the ITU (??) standard for such things, which you would expect should be the standard -- +64 1 2345678 -- is so often rejected both because it includes spaces (though will often accept hyphens in their place) and because the plus-sign is not acceptable (although often one or more of the common, but different, regional standard international access prefixes, such as 0, 00, 011, will be accepted!). Go figure!</p><p>Oh, and the thing that guarantees most strongly that I will never complete registering with a site unless I absolutely, truly must? I have one of those Irish "Fitz..." surnames, where the correct capitalization is FitzWhatever (or perhaps even, at least historically, fitzWhatever, but most people have given up trying to do either because of what I am about to describe, though the Irish are pretty adamant about one or the other still). Does your site insist that it knows better and that uppercase letters can only appear in the first character?  Or, perhaps your site is really enlightened and you know about McWhatever, MacWhatever and O'Whatever, so you have coded exceptions for them?</p><p>Web developers who "know" how to spell my name better than I will rot in hell, along with their websites...</p>
