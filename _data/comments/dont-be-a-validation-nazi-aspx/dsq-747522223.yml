message: "<p>Postelâ€™s Law aside, another reason to be liberal in what you accept is that <em>not everyone does it the same way</em>.<br>Case in point: Phone numbers. <br>Not everyone follows the US model of 123-123-1234.<br>For example, mobile phone numbers in New Zealand all have area code 02x, where x is the mobile provider: 025/027 for Telecom, 021 for Vodafone, and so on. After that prefix, some numbers are 6 digit, some are 7, and some are 8.<br>And, if I mangle my mobile number sufficiently to fit your US template, I'll do so by <em>leaving out my country code</em>, which renders the phone number useless!<br>I've run into similar problems with suburb names - people who \"helpfully\" correct \"Kelson\" into \"Kelston\", when one is in Wellington and the other in Auckland. Or who assume that \"Merivale\" must be in Christchurch, when there's a \"Merivale\" in Tauranga as well.<br>Bottom line: Who knows the phone number better? You, when you don't even know the user in real life? Or the user themselves, who might have been giving out that phone number as a contact for 30 years? <br>Exercise some trust that they know what they're talking about! <br>If they care about you being able to contact them, they'll take care to ensure the details are correct. If they don't care, no amount of machine validation will be sufficient.<br></p>"
