message: <p>Ah, touch√©.<br>Question - What about a consumer of one of these stream who was just <i>listening in on the stream</i>... perhaps trying to record the stream to be saved off for later use. It would seem that they would need to append/insert any missing closing tags so that the file would be readable later. Think of something like podCasting. At the point that you playback a previously recorded file, aren't you now sort of the "broadcaster".<br>Question 1.1 - Are the originators of these streams alloted the same flexability with closing tags as the consumers are? I would <b>ASS</b>ume not, b/c you would still want to ensure that at broadcast time, you have the full content.<br>Something to ponder anyhow...</p>
