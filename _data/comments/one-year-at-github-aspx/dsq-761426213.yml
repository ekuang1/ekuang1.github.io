message: <p>great article, i'd love my company to be at least 1% like this, where i work it SUCKS, it is the total opposite, the teams are 80% management 20% developers, it takes them 80% of the projects time to estimate how long is going to take, and is a micromanagement nightmare, i gotta account for every 15 mins of my time ... wish i had a choice</p>
