message: <p>It looks amazing. I love how easy it is to clone and work with github <a href="http://massage.filmrally.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://massage.filmrally.com/">repos</a>. My one concern is that it may oversimplify some things. It is not particularly clear what the magical sync button does. Does it attempt to merge in any way after pulling?</p>
