message: <blockquote>I believe the founders handle that at the moment as appropriate.</blockquote><p><br>I guess that means you haven't had a pay review yet? Not saying that's a bad thing, but it's typical that most companies (in my country) do pay reviews annually. <br>Is there any type of review process? Is there someone helping you become better or is that left in your hands? Again, not a bad thing, just different which makes me curious.</p>
