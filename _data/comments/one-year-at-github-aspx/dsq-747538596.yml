message: <p>A little bit of me dies inside every time I read a post like this... It's jealousy, more than anything else. I am, however, ecstatically happy that these kind of companies do actually exist.<br>Personally, I'm way beyond bureaucracy, politics, poor management decisions, and keeping up appearances for the sake of it. I'm self employed, but I unfortunately have to deal with people who don't enjoy their jobs, take no ownership, and seem to thrive on creating blockades. I truly wish all companies would adopt this kind of business model :(</p>
