message: <p>A lot of places are like that... both big and small. I'm not even sure if this kind of company exists in the UK - hence why I'm planning to move to the US as soon as physically possible!<br>Seriously though, Phil's worked hard to get where he is, and I don't begrudge him any of it - it's well deserved. It's just a real shame that businesses are what they are - slow, predictable murderers of  any passion a developer has. Thankfully, as bitter and twisted as I am, I still love everything about Development itself; just not the surrounding bullc**p :)</p>
