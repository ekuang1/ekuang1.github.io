message: <p>Is there a way to combine the effects of pp and transform extensions? I am trying to apply a code transformation into a web.config (basically $assemblyname$ and $rootnamespace$) and then merge the resulting config file transform. I was hoping for naming my config file web.config.transform.pp would do the trick but no such luck.</p>
