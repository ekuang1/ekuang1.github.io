message: <p>Every summer up in the mountains of NC, we have a Scottish Highlands festival where I play drums for a small troop.  Last year I finally gave in and tried haggis...it actually wasn't that bad, but knowing exactly what was in it definitely didn't help.  I may or may not give it another shot this year, depends on how much meade I've had to drink (which was a deciding factor as to why I tried it last year).<br><br><br><br>It's also worth mentioning that those crazy Scots have a haggis eating competition each year.  The winner always eats at least 4 full stomachs, and I've heard rumors of some guy eating over 10 in a single sitting, but that the end result wasn't pretty.</p>
