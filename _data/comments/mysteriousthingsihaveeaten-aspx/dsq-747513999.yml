message: <p>Must be a quality thing... Here in MN there is a Japanese resturant that serves natto... Couldn't stand it. I'd be willing to give it another go but...<br><br><br><br>Same for Uni. I just don't think we get good Uni here (of couse this was supported by the fact that a couple of Uni lovers I know would actuall find out what day the local sushi bars would get their shipment of Uni so they could get to the bar within a day or two tops.)<br><br><br><br>Liked Chicken Feet, never had a chance at the other two you list (raw chicken and blowfish) maybe if I make it to Japan some day...<br><br><br><br>And what, no durian? Great fruit! Of course my wife thinks I'm insane.</p>
