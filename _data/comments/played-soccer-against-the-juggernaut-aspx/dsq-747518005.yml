message: <p>Ahh, the Crazy Gang.  Wimbledon were my team, and I was at the cup final in 1988.  Vinnie flattened a Liverpool player within about 10 seconds I think.  He *was* a dirty player, but also had a fair bit of skill, and scored a few screamers in his time.<br>Unfortunately, Wimbledon succumbed to the first American-style franchising in the UK and were moved 70 miles to Milton Keynes, and renamed MK Dons.  They have since plummeted down the league ladder.  The old Wimbledon fans started their own, fan-owned club at the bottom of the league ladder, and are gradually climbing up through the leagues, hoping to pass the MK Dons in a couple of years :)  See <a href="http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk">http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk</a> for more info</p>
