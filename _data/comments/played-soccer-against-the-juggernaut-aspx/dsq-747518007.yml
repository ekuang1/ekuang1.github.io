message: <p>From the looks of the pic of the Juggernaut, I'm thinking "West" Hollywood United? What kind of league is this Haack?<br>Jonesy's Jukebox is a lot of fun - my sister actually got to party with him and John Lydon in Toronto once while they did the movie (my sister did hair styles) "The Fabulous Stains" back in 1981. They had a very good time getting kicked out of bar after bar :). You can imagine how jealous I was!</p>
