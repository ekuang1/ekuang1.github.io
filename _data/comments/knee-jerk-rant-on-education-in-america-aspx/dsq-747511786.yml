message: <p>Phil,<br><br><br><br>Why do Americans need to know anything about Europe when the rest of the world already revolves around us and is only too happy to kow-tow to us and bend to our every whim?  <br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.bruner.net/blog/archives/011904.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.bruner.net/blog/archives/011904.shtml">http://www.bruner.net/blog/archives/011904.shtml</a><br><br><br><br>If CNN can't get their geography correct, why should we demand so much more from our A.P high school students?  If they cared about the rest of world, they'd have signed up for International Baccalaureate courses.  Of course, then they would have to learn the French way....<br><br><br><br>Just kidding on this point, living outside of the U.S. has definitely taught me otherwise, but the holier-than-thou attitude so prevalent in everything America does (marketing, media, politics, education, etc.) makes this type of education the only logical result.  Besides, why would we want children to think?  They might actually try to change something!</p>
