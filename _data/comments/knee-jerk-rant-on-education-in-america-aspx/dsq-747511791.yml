message: <p>Trust me, I'm not attacking Geography.  It's obviously an integral part of history.  It provides context tot history.  What I objected to is the manner in which it is taught.  <br><br><br><br>In the scenario I wrote about, I bet 80 to 90% of the kids will memorize the countries, draw their pretty maps, ace the quiz, and quickly forget what they memorized.<br><br><br><br>My point is to have a big map in the classroom.  Everytime you discuss an important historical note, point out the context on the map.  Interweave Geography in the lesson, don't make it an excercise in rote memorization.  Point out how Geography affects history.</p>
