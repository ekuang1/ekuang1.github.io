message: <p>I must agree with Michael here. I believe the proximity of the european states provides a good foundation from which students can garner knowledge. Geography is useful in historical contexts (to address Barry's concerns) which is why, I believe, it is taught in history. USSR, Czeckoslovakia (spelling may be off), and the former state of Burma are all examples of why knowing geographical history would be useful just within the last 20 years or so. Geography provides "hooks" from which other bits of knowledge can snag (borrowed from Paul Graham[<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.paulgraham.com">www.paulgraham.com</a>] essays). If you read of where Germany attacked, with his expansion south into the Rhineland, for instance, it is most helpful to know where that is exactly so one can know the implications it held for the surrounding area.</p>
