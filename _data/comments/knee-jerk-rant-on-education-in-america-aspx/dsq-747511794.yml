message: <p>Walt, the President isn't exactly sitting at the top end of the bell curve.  He's hardly an example of the success or failure of our education system.<br><br><br><br>Scoring higher on standardize tests only proves you're a good test taker.  As for whether they enter college better prepared or not, I don't have evidence to refute that. But I ask you, is that solely because of the focus on rote memorization? Or are there other cultural issues at play.<br><br><br><br>In any case, Dan sent me this story that I think ends up backing my point to a degree. It talks about how as a nation (and worldwide in fact) IQ's have been on a steady track upward.  Apparently it wasn't a noticeable phenomena because IQ testing companies kept quietly recalibrating tests.  Guess what is at the cause of the increase in IQ?  It surely isn't rote memorization.<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/articles/050516crbo_books" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/articles/050516crbo_books">http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/articles/050516crbo_books</a></p>
