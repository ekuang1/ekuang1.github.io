message: <p>When I win the lottery my first step is to give God His share. Then, I would consult a financial advisor for the wisest way to invest most of the winnings. Of course, I would buy a home, a car, and go on a nice vacation, but I would also make equal donations to members of my extended family. The best part of winning would be the security of investing for a comfortable future for myself and my chilren. I think the key is to stay grounded.</p>
