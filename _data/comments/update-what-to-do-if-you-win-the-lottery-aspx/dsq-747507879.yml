message: <p>THE FIRST THING I WOULD NOT DO IS SIGN IT IN YOUR PERSONAL NAME.Depending on your state tax rules you might be able to minimize your tax liability by signing it in the name of an LLC, or some type of company. Get to a lawyer BEFORE you sign it, after you know it's a winning ticket. Or pre-plan this if you think to continue to play the lottery.<br>Then contact a guy in Medford Oregon,called Gino Casternovia. He is a financial planner that will help you minimize your taxes AFTER you receive your winnings.<br>He can help you learn how to invest safely,offshore. Off shore is a designation, NOT a location. Nevada is considered "offshore" and so is Wyoming.<br>Gino Casternovia will show you how to take advantage of minimizing taxes(which can be substantial). and what off shore means, and what to do with the tax advantages offered by off shore designation. Then there is off shore, meaning other countries.<br>There are caribbean countries that SEEM like a good deal but the US government can and will make inquiries about your accounts there, and that country will hand over immediately whatever the US Government asks for.<br>However in Panama, there are options available that are worth checking into.<br>Read up on it. Take no one's word for any of this. Check into this information, and you may be pleasantly surprised. Do google Gino Casternovia and get to his website, whether you are into money are not. You'll learn a lot, and it will be a worthwhile expenditure of time.</p>
