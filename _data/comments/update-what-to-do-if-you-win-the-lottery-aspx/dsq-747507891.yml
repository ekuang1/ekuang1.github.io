message: "<p>Update: Gino Casternovia was tried for and convicted of conspiracty to commit fraud against the US, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  He is to be sentenced on July 6, 2010.  \"Offshore\" means just that, offshore.  No matter how you set things up whether in Wyoming or Nevada, they are not offshore.  There's a lot of tax misinformation out there designed to appeal to your sense of greed.  If you want to know what the tax laws really mean your best bet is to ask the IRS.  They do not write tax laws, they simply apply/enforce them.  If you rely on the internet and internet-based promoters for your tax guidance you have no one to blame but yourself for any ensuing trouble.  Gino and his kind are simply misguided scam artists.</p>"
