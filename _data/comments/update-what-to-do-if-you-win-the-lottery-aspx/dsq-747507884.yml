message: <p>When I win the lottery, I would make as manys people lives better as I can. I would work out "the great good for the greatest amount of people". I already live a happy life, so the more people i could help to be like me now, the richer the world. If you look up money in the dictionary, what does it say? It it doesnt say happiness. I believe being rich is having family and friends. Why do i need that much money when there is starving children, war, homeless, health shortages etc. Look at the real world. Save the world and you save yourself. what use is millions of dollars if there is no one around to share it with?</p>
