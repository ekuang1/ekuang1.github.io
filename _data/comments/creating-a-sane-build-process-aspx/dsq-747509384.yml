message: "<p>Sure, I could just TELL you about it.  But what would be the fun in that?  The reader can just as easily concoct his or her own mental image of an ominously complicated build process that checks everything in and out of source code after every micro-operation.<br><br><br><br>Just to contribute one actual tidbit of potentially useful information in this comment: in addition to the qualifications you've specified above, it also seems important that a build process be fast, and thus amenable to continuous integration (or a \"continuous-integration-like\" build process whereby people don't feel like they need to have the entire system bug free before it's \"worth it\" to do a build.)  Ideally, you would have performance tests for the build (written for NUnit), to measure performance enhancements, then have those performance tests run by an uber build process, and then the uber build process gets sparked when the build process is modified.  Interesting.. that started out as a lame joke but might actually be a good idea for someone with a ton of time on their hands.. and a slight case of OCD. ;)</p>"
