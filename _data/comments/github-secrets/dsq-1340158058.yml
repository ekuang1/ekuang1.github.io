message: '<p>Products and applications of natural biological sources preservatives</p><p>1 , lysozyme</p><p>Lysozyme is a toxic protein , a microorganism capable of selectively decomposing the cell walls of pathogenic bacteria within phagocytic cells from the damaging effects to suppress the propagation of microorganisms .<a href="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Marbofloxacin.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Marbofloxacin.html">Marbofloxacin</a>， Especially against Gram -positive bacteria have a strong lysis can be used as sake , cheese, sausage , butter , raw preservative pasta , seafood and ice cream and other foods.</p><p>2 , Nisin (Nisin)</p><p>Nisin is a polypeptide compound by a variety of amino acids can be used as nutrients are absorbed by the body . In 1969, the Food and Agriculture Organization / World Health Organization (FAL / WHO) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives confirm nisin as a food preservative . March 1992 the Ministry of Health approved the implementation of the document states : " Science can be considered as a food preservative nisin is safe ." It can effectively inhibit food spoilage caused by many Gram-positive bacteria, such as Clostridium botulinum , Staphylococcus aureus ,<a href="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Aztreonam.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Aztreonam.html">Aztreonam</a>， hemolytic streptococcus, Listeria , Bacillus stearothermophilus spores growth and reproduction , especially for produce spores of Gram-positive bacteria have effects. Antibacterial effect of nisin by interfering with the normal function of the cell membrane v , resulting in penetration of cell membranes, and membrane potential nutrient loss , resulting in pathogenic and spoilage bacteria cell death. It is a non-toxic natural preservatives , no adverse effects on food color , smell, taste , texture and so on. Now been widely used in dairy products, canned products , fish products and alcoholic beverages.</p><p>3 , Natamycin (Natamycin)</p><p>Natamycin (Natamycin), is satisfied that he controlled fermentation of Streptomyces a white to creamy white odorless crystalline powder , usually in the presence of the enol structure . Its mechanism of action is associated with fungal ergosterol and other sterols alcohol groups binding repressor ergosterol biosynthesis,<a href="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Norfloxacin.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Norfloxacin.html">Norfloxacin</a>， so that distortion of the membrane , resulting in leakage, causing cell death. In the bakery Dough with natamycin surface treatment significantly prolong the shelf life of action . Add the sausage, jam and other food and beverage production in a certain amount of natamycin , both to prevent mildew , and will not interfere with other nutrients.</p><p>4,8 a polylysine</p><p>8 a polylysine research abroad, especially in more mature in Japan, China has just started . It is a natural biological metabolic products. Has a good thermal stability and disinfection , biological preservatives having excellent corrosion resistance and great commercial potential .<a href="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Natamycin.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Natamycin.html">Natamycin</a>， In Japan, eight have been approved by a poly-lysine added to foods as a preservative widely used instant rice , wet cooked noodles, cooked vegetables , seafood, sauce, soy sauce, fish and fresh biscuits anticorrosion .research 8 a polylysine Preservation of milk . When using 420mg / L 8 2% of a poly- lysine and glycine complex , fresh is best , you can save the 11d, and there is still a high acceptability , also found that 8 of a poly- lysine and other natural antibacterial agent used in conjunction with obvious synergies that can improve their antimicrobial activity .</p><p>In the United States , the researchers suggested that 8 a polylysine as a preservative for foods. 8 a practice found polylysine with protein foods or acidic polysaccharides interact ,<a href="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Cefdinir.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.medchemexpress.com/Cefdinir.html">Cefdinir</a>， resulting in loss of antimicrobial activity , and 8 a polylysine weak emulsifying capacity . 8 is therefore limited to a poly- lysine starchy foods.</p><p>Medchemexpress Can provide the above product,its website:<a href="http://www.medchemexpress.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.medchemexpress.com">www.medchemexpress.com</a></p>'
