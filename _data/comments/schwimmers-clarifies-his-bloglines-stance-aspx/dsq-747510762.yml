message: <p>1.  But applications in this day and age blur the lines between desktop and online.  For example, I can search for blogs using my desktop RSS aggregator.  How's that different than searching Bloglines? <br><br><br><br>The argument that a desktop reader has to be subscribed to the feed to view it doesn't hold any water.  First of all, the actual feed itself is on the web. (<a href="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/rss.xml" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://trademark.blog.us/blog/rss.xml">http://trademark.blog.us/blog/rss.xml</a>).  Performing a Google search will sometimes display my feed instead of the actual page.<br><br><br><br>Secondly, the preview feature is merely an automation of a task a person can do without bloglines.  Simply do a Google search, temporarily subscribe to the feed, now unsubscribe.  Subscription, whether by desktop or by bloglines, doesn't confer upon the subscriber any special status.<br><br><br><br>I agree that the law is on Martin's side, but I disagree that he's taking the best approach.  I don't think copyright law is keeping pace with technology.  Trying to force technology to fit the law stifles innovation.  It's not an open shut case.  Is Bloglines a desktop app that just happens to be on the web?  Or do desktop apps with significant online features need to be restricted as Martin has done to Bloglines?</p>
