message: <p>1) A desktop reader will display an ad to you alone - the sole person using the program at the time. There is a huge difference between that and what Bloglines does (the preview feature) where anyone on the net can search for the feed and view it. In an desktop reader the user has to be subscribed to the feed to view it. On Bloglines people can search for a feed and view it.<br><br><br><br>2) The Google comparison is different. Google displays a cache of the page. They do not edit the page at all. If I have ads on the page, it will show it. Google caches a duplicate of the page. <br><br><br><br>What you are failing to realize is that many sponsor contracts have terms regarding the sponsorship, for example competing ads on the same page, etc. Ads ontop of the ads in place by the site owner causes conflict. There are many business reasons as to why a site owner would not want their content used in a commercial manner.<br><br><br><br>Martin isn't forcing the new technology to fit to his wishes - the law is on Martin's side. The new technology has to fit the law, and those who don't understand that will ultimately pay the price....and that's their choice. :)</p>
