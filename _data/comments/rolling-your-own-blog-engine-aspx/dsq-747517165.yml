message: <p>Why would you write own blog engine. I think most, if not all blog engines contain more than i really need for example. Another is not just learning, but practicing programming, fixing up the code, etc. With your own code you might exactly know where error comes from and figure out more easier than to go through every single line of a big blogging engine, where you get lost once in a while or pretty much most of the time.</p>
