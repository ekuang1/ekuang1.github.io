message: <p>That's very pleasing to hear! If only I had VS 2005 I might be able to find some time to contribute the code to this. I'm not sure if it was the roadmap or your documentation on the way to force .text style multi-user blogs that said that you wanted this to remain a single user blog engine. If I've mis-interpreted then my bad. What version have you penciled in membership provider for? I just read the road map again and unless I'm missing something, I can't see it.</p>
