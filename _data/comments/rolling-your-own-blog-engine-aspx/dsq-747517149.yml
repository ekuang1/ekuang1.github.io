message: <p>Whoops! Yah. I meant 1.0 Transitional.  My mind is a mesh of version numbers.<br>Well my blog validates as 1.1 transitional for the most part.  But as you point out, I often have to edit stuff that WLW posts.  I submitted a feature request to have an XHTML compliance mode for WLW.<br>If you'd like to help Subtext be more compliant, we'd welcome any help.  The hard part is that I can't own every skin, so I'm not sure which are compliant and which are not.  I just know we do everything in our power to not mess up any work you do to be compliant.</p>
