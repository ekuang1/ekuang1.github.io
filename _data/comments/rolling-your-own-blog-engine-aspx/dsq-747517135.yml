message: <p>I'll chime in with the "Me too's"...my first blog I started 3 years ago was a homegrown solution, which was also back when RSS was little known about among other things we take for granted today.  <br>Once I realized how much time it would take to keep up with all the nuts and bolts that are now included in most blog packages I ditched it and went with a shrinkwrapped solution...there is no way I could have kept up on my own.</p>
