message: <p>Agree with this post.<br>I used several blog engines in the past, some more CMS than others and finally settled on textpattern as my choice as it was free and relatively simple to setup (as well as being geared towards a designer rather than a coder).<br>However like all things, I found myself wondering if I could have done something better or asking why such and such feature was present/not present.<br>Having had a go at it I recommend writing a simple blog to anyone who wants to get into Web Development as it teaches you some fundamental concepts and you get to experience the highs and lows of dealing with the wider web related issues.<br>However I am at a stage now where I am looking to update my website and after much searching I have decided why reinvent the wheel when there are already some fantastic open source solutions out there.<br>I have gone for BlogEngine.NET due to its simplicity and also due to the fact that being a smaller code base than dasBlog and Subtext, I can more easily understand it in a short space of time and further extend the code to my liking.<br>Multi-Blogging is something I am interested in however I haven't found many solutions that offer such a thing, usually leaning more towards a mult-user blog engine but I think things are changing now and with people like us who are willing to invest into existing open source solutions I am sure over time we will start seeing some great additions to these already feature rich blogging engines.<br>Adios,<br>Fz</p>
