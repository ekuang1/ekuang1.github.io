message: <p>I had been using wordpress as my blogengine. (I've tried other engines, stuck with wordpress)<br>But python is my language of choice, and although I can write in PHP, it made customizations to the blog really slow having to translate. I knew one day I had to make the switch anyway and once I've done that I could easily do everything to my liking. So I did. And it's true.. I had to steal code from the open community as much as I could and I love everyone for that. Thanks for your article!</p>
