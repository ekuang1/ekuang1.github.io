message: <p>I think writing your own blog engine is a great idea.  And the best part is that you <strong>don't</strong> have to bother with someone else's list of required features.  You code it to your needs and leave the rest out.  Then add more features as you need them.<br>And Phil, which of those three open source blog engines that you mention supports XHTML compliance?  :-)<br></p>
