message: "<p>I created my own blog engine for following reasons:<br><strong>Learning: </strong> I have learnt a lot about safety procedures while using PHP-MySQL. Prior to that, I never thought of 'validating user input'. Had, it not been my own blog engine, I would have never learnt securing PHP-MySQL applications. I am glad that I counted among the 'better' web programmers.<br><strong>No frills = More security</strong>: The lesser the no. of frills, the less I have to worry about security holes and complicated vulnerabilities. After why should I keep a functionality when I don't need it. <br><strong>Not harassed by spam bots:</strong> I have a wordpress blog too. But I am overwhelmed by the amount of viagra and loan spam I <br>receive. <br></p>"
