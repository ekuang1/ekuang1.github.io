message: "<p>Here's one of the reasons I wrote my own blog engine: learning.  I learn much better by doing than by reading someone else's code.<br>Though I completely agree with your article: the blog was easy as pie to get going, but difficult to do well.  I'm still hoeing that road, actually.  I just recently discovered Akismet--what a fantastic discovery that I wish I had known about 6 months ago when I first implemented my (awful) CAPTCHA.</p>"
