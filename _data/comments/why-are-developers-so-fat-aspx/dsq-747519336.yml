message: <p>Development is not, in my opinion, an average 8-5 job. And i sometimes feel that one can  be outgoing and fit and social and be just an average programmer at the same time. <br>If one wants to be great at programming, i guess it goes beyond just 8-5. For me i choose to be an 8-5 developer...no more coding and devote time to other things like staying fit and being social. I learnt a lesson in my grad school CS program that the more i worked the less social and fatter i got.<br></p>
