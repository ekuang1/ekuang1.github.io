message: <p>I'm fairly certain the health habits have less to do with t-shirts, and more to do with inactivity.  I never take those free t-shirts, because I'm picky about my clothes.<br>Anyway, my advice... Get a dog.  Walk the dog 30 minutes a day.<br>Now one could say just walk 30 minutes a day, but there is always something more important to do.  The beauty of having the dog, is that the dog will remind you that going for a walk is important.<br>We have a miniature long-haired Dachshund, and she's a sweetheart and she loves going for walks.  She's also helping keep our cats healthy and fit by chasing them.</p>
