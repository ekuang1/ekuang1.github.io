message: <p>That's not my problem. My problem is I'm lazy. (duh!) That and once you have a kid (tick tock tick tock) and both parents work, it's hard to work in a work out.<br>Now that's she's walking, and running, and listening to our instructions. We should be able to start going for family walks, which will help with my waistline.<br>All that aside, when I am working out I still don't fit into an XL. All that stuff around my middle turns into muscle and moves up into my chest and shoulders. Usually the seams of the sleeves on an XL shirt end up somewhere around an inch and a half from the base of my neck. So it looks like I'm wearing a too-tight wifebeater from Hoodiehoo systems inc llc.<br>The XL shirts make great sleep and painting/work shirts for my wife though.</p>
