message: <p>I hear yeah! I hate those XL shirts. I'm a M or a L depending on the shirt. I believe that being phsyically active also helps out the mind too. I hit the gym 3 times a week and that 30-40 minutes on the cardio machine is a great time to think about coding issues.<br>Also, I used to be a fat computer playing kid growing up. When I was around 20 I decided to lose the weight and now I'm a much happier, healthier, more productive person.</p>
