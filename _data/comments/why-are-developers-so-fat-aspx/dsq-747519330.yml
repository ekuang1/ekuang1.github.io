message: <p>Andy,<br>While telling people how to live their lives is certainly not my intent, some people just need that bit of motivation.  Ask anybody who has lost weight and started exercising (or just read some of the comments here or on my blog) and they'll tell you how much better they feel!  I'm just trying to prompt the issue for people to feel better physically and mentally.  Certainly not trying to offend anyone, but rather, jump start people.</p>
