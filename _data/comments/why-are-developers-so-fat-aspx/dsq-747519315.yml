message: <p>Aimed at Raymond and not you Phil but my own take on this is while as geeks we can out geek each other, in terms of family, health or personal matters there is a line. Telling geeks "gosh so many of you are so fat!" is IMHO crossing that line. Is it there lives and no one has any right to tell them how to live it.</p>
