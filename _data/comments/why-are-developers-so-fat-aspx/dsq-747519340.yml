message: <p><br>That is actually interesting to me.  I have a feeling at least for me living at my computer, drinking way to much coffee and caffeine products matched with pizza (easy to eat while working) probably doesn't help a lot with trying to not fit into the stereotype.  Also I wonder how much work environments play into it by adding additional stress or decreasing stress.  Do you happen to know if David Platt's presentation is available anywhere?  It sounds extremely interesting.<br>@Paul I agree 100% with you about programming not being the 8-5 routine.  It is nice to have the flexibility.  I just need to utilize mine a little better :-).<br></p>
