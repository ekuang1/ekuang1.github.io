message: <p>If only I could get <strong>down</strong> to an XL shirt.<br>Although I'm 35, I've only been a professional developer for about seven years.  Before that I had much more physical jobs.<br>I have <strong>felt</strong> my body's slide into blubberdom, now that I sit at a desk all day.  Yeah, I know, get out and exercise.  I will, really, as soon I write some more code :)<br></p>
