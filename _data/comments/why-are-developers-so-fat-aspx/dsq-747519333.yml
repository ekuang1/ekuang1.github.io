message: "<p>I'm 35, obscenely fat and I carry a backpack around ALL DAY. Sadly, I don't need glasses. :)<br>In my case I believe is genetic: I'm genetically lazy. Although I've worked on more physical endeavors such as factory work, bars and so on prior to my coding devotion, I've <strong>always</strong> been overweight. Now it's really over the top: last December I weighted 165 Kgs on a 1.68 meter frame (that's 363.76 pounds on 5.5 feet on your scary and non-standard system). Yeah, I know. Strangely, I'm in good health: my analysis show that my only deviation from the norm is taht I'm a little bit low in sugar (ain't it ironic?). <br>Anyways, since December I've started a diet combined with acupuncture that's working really well: I've lost 55 pounds to date. :)<br>So I guess I'm on my way to an L-sized convention T-Shirt, thank you Eric. If only I could attend conventions... which brings me to another topic, one that I'd like to raise a debate from: how come all the COOL T-Shirts avaliable to buy via the Internet are for Linux guys? How come I cannot show proudly my true colors to the world? Where can I get the \"Gimme Windows, .NET and SQL Server or gimme death\" T-Shirts? :)</p>"
