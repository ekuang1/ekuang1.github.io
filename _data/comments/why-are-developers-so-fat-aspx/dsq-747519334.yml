message: <p>BTW, Microsoft did cater in some rather healthy food for people to eat.  Beef, salmon, sandwich meats such as turkey and roast beef etc.  It was all the soda and the snacks that people consume.  And the amount of potatoes people would eat was amazing.  It was more of an observation of people in general and not a reflection of what kinds of food are being provided at conferences.</p>
