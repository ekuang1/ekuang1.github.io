message: "<p>@Andy, I felt Raymond was merely making an observation. It's no secret that software development can be an intense profession and that passion for the craft can lead to other inactivity and perhaps an expansion of the beltline.<br>Of course, his observation is purely anecdotal, so it could be completely off base. But judging from the comments, it certainly struck a nerve. <br>I felt his post was meant to be encouraging to those who are looking for support. We're not supposed to talk about these things, but many struggle with it.<br>Ironically, one of my posts with the most comments (and still coming in) was in at throwaway post: <a href=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2004/03/27/eating-too-much.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2004/03/27/eating-too-much.aspx\">https://haacked.com/archive/...</a><br>The comments section has become a confessional!<br>It's the title of *this* post, not Raymond's, that makes a strong generalization. But my post was really about a different topic. I merely used the weight issue as to frame the real point. One-size does not fit all.<br>It was a joke to suggest that people would get fat in order to fit in a large t-shirt. Interestingly enough, most comments are more interested in the weight issue than that point. :)<br>Not that I'm complaining.</p>"
