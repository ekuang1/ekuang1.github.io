message: <p>I started gaining weight after I left the USAF. I took a technical instructor job in the semiconductor industry and gained 10 lbs. I got married, gained 10 more. Got divorced, gained 10 more. Took a job as a developer and was chained to a desk, gained 20 more. Recently my wife and I started a diet. 7 months into it, I'm down 35 she's down 40. I've lost 6 inches off my waist. It was no special diet plan, we just started controlling what we ate and boosted our activity. No more cholestrol problem, I sleep better, I'm no longer borderline diabetic, and my acid reflux is gone. I'm writing better code, and I get lucky 3-4 times a week as opposed to twice a month. Life is good.</p>
