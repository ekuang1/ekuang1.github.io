message: <p>When I got out of school, I started an increase in weight that I found very, very undesirable.  I ended up adjusting my eating habits (nothing crazy, just being more sensible) and exercising, a combination of cardio and weightlifting that I cycle over six days every week.  Some might think it's a little crazy, but an hour of intense physical activity compared to the other 23 where I don't do much isn't much in the scheme of things.<br>As a result, I have a body much closer to what I want than what I don't.  I'll take a medium please. =)<br>There is a great episode of the Simpsons where Homer decides that he doesn't want to work anymore.  While looking for ways to classify himself as disabled, he comes across obese, which (in the show) is classified as 300 lbs or more (this results in a great scene where he eats play-doh in order to creep above 299 lbs, only to find the towel bar was supporting his stomach).<br>Anyways, at one point, he goes into a shop to buy clothes, and the salesman asks what Homer does.  He responds "something to do with computers".  Homer ends up getting a mumu.<br>While I think that it was incredibly funny, it is also incredibly telling.<br>I applaud Eric as well for helping curb the tide of fat developers.</p>
