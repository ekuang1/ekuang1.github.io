message: <p>Do you have any insight into recommended auth methods using WebAPI when it will be consumed programmatically?  I was playing with it a couple months back and I felt like I was stuck between forcing the client to use a weird forms based hack where they auth, store the cookie, and include the cookie with every request, and implementing a complicated OAuth-style token mechanism.  Is there any hope for a simple standard api authentication mechanism to make its way into WebAPI (besides using windows authentication :-)?</p>
