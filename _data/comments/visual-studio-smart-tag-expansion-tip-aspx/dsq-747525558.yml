message: "<p>Risking to sound somewhat stuck up: it feels a bit good to finally know something you didn't ;)<br>The ctrl+. ctrl+space and double tab are the three most used shortcuts for me.<br>After that f5 and f9 with all their variants.<br>And as a final the custom mapped \"rename\", \"toggle collapse all\" and \"run tests in current scope\".<br>Does anybody else here feel that the standard keyboard scheme for VS is rediculous? Shortcuts should not be combinations of keystrokes ([combination1],[combination2]).<br>If there would be one tool I'm missing in vs it's a descent shortcut mapping tool that doesn't require me to remove a certain shortcut from all conflicting functions before I can assign it to a new one.</p>"
