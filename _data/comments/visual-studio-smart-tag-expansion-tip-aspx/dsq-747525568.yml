message: <p>@Boersnoes<br>Check out Code Rush and Refactor Pro! from <a href="http://DevExpress.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="DevExpress.com">DevExpress.com</a>.  Mark Miller makes the same complaint during his "Mark Miller on CodeRush with Refactor!" screencast on DNRTV (<a href="http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=107" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=107">http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showNum=107</a>) and shows how Code Rush and Refactor can make those annoying VS hotkey combinations much better.</p>
