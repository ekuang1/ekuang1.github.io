message: '<p>Just wanted to personally thank you for this information. I was incurring the dreaded Error: 1054 due to my application calling settings out of a conf file. Little did I realize, my application was trying to fetch this file from within the system32 folder, not the folder local to the service executable itself! At any rate, this simple one-liner addressed my startup issue, thank you kindly!</p>'
