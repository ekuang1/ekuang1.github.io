message: "<p>I worked for a large corporate, a senior tech manager was concerned about the amount of OSS going into the products. We set up a meeting with the board's solicitor, who promptly okayed all the OSS as a load of hippy, ideological licencing and simply instructed us to avoid non-permissive licences.</p><p>Lessons I learnt: (i) You get what you pay for in life, that includes legal advise. (ii) Don't let managers hide behind their BS interpretation, if you have access to legal, use it (iii) OSS licences are well written and clear to even none tech people.</p>"
