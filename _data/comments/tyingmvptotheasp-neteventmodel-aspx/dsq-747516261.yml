message: <p>"Premature Generalization" - I love it!  Up front planning certainly has its place, but it drives me nuts when I hear developers boasting that 80% of their code has been put into a reusable, configurable framework for everyone else to use.  Because A) YAGNI, B) only 10%, if any, is ever going to be reused and C) they just blew their schedule and budget building something that brought no value to the client.</p>
