message: <p>he he...Glad I inspired a post :) <br>I understand the generalization principle (and like it!)...I was originally constructing the project I am working on right now for ASP.NET exclusively and have begun to see the need to allow some stuff squirt onto a PDA (of which i have NO experience), so it's a consideration for me. <br>I started with the UIP (like Gravatar) and also found the overgeneralization to be way to complex. <br>I love the MVP pattern and am glad it is getting so much press. Thanks for your writeups!</p>
