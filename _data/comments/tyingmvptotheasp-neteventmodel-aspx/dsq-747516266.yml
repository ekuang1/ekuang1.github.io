message: <p>I completely concur on this point.  I spent a lot of time in my own application framework crafting a set of interfaces and presentation services that actually was a consistent programming model for both platforms, including support for a Command pattern implementation used to abstract the event handling differences between WinForms and WebForms apps (the controller was responsible for providing a "Command" factory which was used to create "Command" objects in the "IView" abstract base implementation.  <br>Over the development cycles of several systems, I only found the common abstractions useful one time across web and Windows implementations (where web services and domain objects were involved).  Even in that case, the Command pattern abstraction was only useful in the Windows implementation.<br>In practice, it turns out that the MVP abstractions for web and Windows applications are only common at the very highest levels, and there is not much to be gained by attempting to make the two share any significant parts of an implementation framework. YAGNI.</p>
