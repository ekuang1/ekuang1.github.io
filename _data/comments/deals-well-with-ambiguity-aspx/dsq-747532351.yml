message: <p>hejdig.<br>It is easy for us computer guys to use computers for everything but as little as a carpenter uses a hammer for everything, so shouldn't we.<br>I am not sure making an adaptable application is always a good idea.  One of the strengths with computers is that they don't handle strays from the right path.<br>If I want a perfect machine I choose a computer.  1s and 0s.  Nothing in between.<br>Instead of crippling a computer and its user with uncertain outcome - instead make the application solid but usable in a manner that allows ambiguity on another level (i.e. user level).<br>(i still think your article mentions a good idea)<br>/OF</p>
