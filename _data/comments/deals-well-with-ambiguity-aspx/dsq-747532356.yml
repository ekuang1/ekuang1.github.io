message: "<p>Maybe the main issue is that we strive for shipping a perfect snapshot of software rather than a system designed for change?  (ie. we're building with wood and steel beams rather than mouldable materials such as clay).<br>\"a promising approach would move away from programming with objects and functions and look at building software using autonomous software agents that communicate with each other via messages as the primary building block of programs.\"<br>Why does this have to be in the absence of objects?  Smalltalk has largely promoted messages, and Alan Kay has apologized for the confusion of classes time and time again.  Message based systems exist alongside objects.. the two are not mutually exclusive.<br>For what you are envisioning I think late-binding will sufficiently satisfy this need.  Besides, look at the most popular/successful system which exists, ie. the web, all it is, is one large late-bound system.  The late-boundness of it, is largely a huge part of its success.  Its a great example of the system you are describing, ie. a system which was designed for change and to evolve.<br>Alot of comments mention AI, AI is not necessary, there is no need for \"intelligent\" / \"smart\" machines which can understand and resolve.  Don't get me wrong, the idea is great.. but for 80% of what we need, intelligence is not needed.  Late-binding can facilitate all of this, along with messages as you say.<br>I truly encourage you to watch Alan Kay's 1997 OOPSLA keynote.  It is a true eye-opening experience and an amazing talk.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in computers... there are so many gems.<br>Video:<br><a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2950949730059754521#\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2950949730059754521#\">video.google.com/videoplay</a><br>Transcript: <br><a href=\"http://blog.moryton.net/2007/12/computer-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://blog.moryton.net/2007/12/computer-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet.html\">blog.moryton.net/...</a><br>Thanks for the great posts and great work!<br></p>"
