message: <p>@Jonas SOA and autonomous agents share the idea of autonomy, but are otherwise very different. Autonomous agents are flexible, something lacking in SOA which by definition requires an explicit contract.<br>In SOA, boundaries are explicit, but not necessarily so with agents. For example, you can have a set of agents from a hive where they share a set of data as a collective, but are each independently autonomous.<br>@Jesse I think there's a subtle distinction between autonomous agents and AI. Agents don't require "intelligence" but rather flexibility. Sometimes, the behavior that emerges appears intelligent. For example, some satellites already employ these concepts to enable satellites to deal with unexpected situations. I'll write a follow-up to describe examples.<br>@LosManos yes, this would require a new way of programming where we're more concerned about setting a *range* of valid outcomes and not so concerned about how the software reaches the outcome. I'll cover than in my follow-up.<br>@Andy indeed. So if we ask the software to deal with ambiguity, we must also be prepared to deal with ambiguity well. Interesting point. :)</p>
