message: <p>Funny, I did just the opposite and condensed myself from a few blogs down to one. Too much <a href="http://dirtydogstink.com/blog/2006/08/15/TakingBackMyBlog.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dirtydogstink.com/blog/2006/08/15/TakingBackMyBlog.aspx">identity crisis</a> for me to handle and I felt like I was ignoring one or the other at various times which led to me ignoring both. Now one me = one blog. :)<br>Personally, I like it when a person's personality comes through so don't keep us in the dark with the other stuff. Best of luck!</p>
