message: <p>I need to get the address for Chosun Galbi for my boss....and I keep finding two locations listed -- one was 1040 S. Western and one is 3330 W. Olympic....are those both in Koreatown?  She said she wanted the one in Koreatown....I'm confused...is it the same restaurant that just moved?  If anyone knows, I'd really appreciate it!  Thanks!</p>
