message: <p>The soontofu place behind hodori is called sokongdong. <br>The small sulungtang place you might be referring to is jinju gomtang. It's no longer small and it's no longer where it used to be. It's now on the corner of alexandria and wilshire.<br>The kal gook su place is olympic kalgooksu. It's located 2 blocks east of crenshaw on a side street. When you see the mobil gas station turn right if going east and it's the first parking lot on your right side. I went there last week and they expanded.</p>
