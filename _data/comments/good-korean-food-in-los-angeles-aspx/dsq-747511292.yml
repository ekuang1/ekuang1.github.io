message: "<p>Guys try some new stuff in K-town~<br>Gil-mok restaurant in 9th &amp; westmoreland - (cow)tongue meat with dong-chi-mi noodle.<br>Dong-chi-mi noddle is COLD white kimchi soup. It's little sweet &amp; sour and cool. Might not like it first time. Recommend eat with tongue meat. <br>Byul-dae-po 6th &amp; kenmore(?) - intestines(gop-chang)&lt;it's not=\"\" raw=\"\"&gt;<br>Similar with Korean BBQ but it's intestines!!<br>Don-dae-ji 3rd &amp; serrano - pork lovers : order papa's pork. <br>Interior not bad. Price is reasonable. Quality and the taste is fantastic.<br>Go-ba-woo 7th &amp; vermont - Steamed pork with kimchi &amp; veggie<br>Might not like the smell inside of restaurant. But absolutely healthy food.(no oil)<br>Si-gol-ssam-bab western &amp; oakwood? or maplewood - Korean bbq house.<br>But veggie lovers will love this place. All meats are unlimited for around $15 and variety vegitables you will get for wrap. Vegitables are unlimited too.</p>"
