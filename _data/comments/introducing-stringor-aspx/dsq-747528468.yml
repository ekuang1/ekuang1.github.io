message: <p>Hello! MVC is a great product (or tech, whatever), but is annoying the kind of interaction we most forced to deal with. I mean the mass use of HTML helper methods instead of the extremely most pleasure component based approach. I know this is a remarkable work to do in order to enable this design pattern in MVC, but in my opinion, while this limitation exist, MVC will be a downgrade compared to WebForm, in term of design capabilities and useability.</p>
