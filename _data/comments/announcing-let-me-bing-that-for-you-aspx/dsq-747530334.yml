message: <p>Hey Phil, nice idea done well. I had seen the google version and I was tempted to use it a couple of times but when I start thinking about using it then its time to stop doing the forums for the day :)<br>Some friendly constructive criticism you might want to put on your todo list:<br> - In firefox the search box is bigger, the gap between the go button and the bottom of the text box is taller than other paddings.<br> - the www and non-www versions both serve content, i know you probably aren't too concerned about the seo with this project but its better to have 301's from one to another<br> - if you click back from bing to your site the textbox is filled out with the search query. the animation still works and it overwrites ok. i dont know if this is fixable or a browser 'feature'?<br> - i noticed that you don't block the redirect pages with a noindex or robots.txt<br> - the "Type in a question and click the search button" text is transparent along with the background in Firefox. With today's picture it was a little hard to read.<br>ok im done :)</p>
