message: <p>Ok, I admit, I was little over the line, sorry for that. I just reacted on impulse because I really like what you did in past and what are you doing for other developers in .net space. <br>I do not have rights to criticize you without some innovative online idea/project, that is true also, but here I am taking position as average .net developer that, as I said, really like new directions that ms is taking in web development. So, when I am opening <a href="http://haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="haacked.com">haacked.com</a>, I am expecting to see new things and thoughts about how we can more improve tools and practices and when I see something like "Let me bing that for you" which is, lets be honest about that, just pure bing(ms) marketing, well...you know :)<br>I do not know, maybe it is better to "if you don't have something nice to say, don't talk", on the other side, maybe comments on blog are built just for that-to honestly tell what you think, as I did.<br>anyway<br>Cheers and no hard feelings :)<br>Marko</p>
