message: <p>@Marko Thanks for commenting. First of all, this site wasn't created by Microsoft. It was a weekend project by three guys who thought it'd be a funny parody.<br>You ask the question (paraphrasing), "Why do we need this?".<br>Why get upset about it? Let the market decide. If it's not for you, don't visit the site. It's a principle called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Two_Feet#Philosophy" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Law of two feet">the law of two feet</a>. Many people felt the same way about Twitter (Why do we need this!). Apparently, there are people who do like it. Why rain on their parade?<br>Second, regarding your point about ORIGINAL, is any innovation really original? I'd say most of the ORIGINAL innovations you see are actually copies and refinements of existing ideas.<br>C# was seen as a copy of Java, but later, Java copied the Attributes (annotations in Java) and generics from C#. Innovation is one big stewing pot.<br>Google for example, was a copy of other search engines, but they innovated by streamlining the UI and copying an existing mathematical concept of weighted network nodes and applied it to the web.<br>Windows copied Mac which copied Xerox Parc (which you could argue truly invented something original, though they did copy the physical desk ;)<br>Now, I'm not putting <a href="http://letmebingthatforyou.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="letmebingthatforyou.com">letmebingthatforyou.com</a> in the same category as these things. Those are capital "I" innovations. With <a href="http://letmebingthatforyou.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="letmebingthatforyou.com">letmebingthatforyou.com</a>, we've made some tiny refinements. We auto shrink the URL using TinyUrl and we dynamically update the background to match <a href="http://Bing.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Bing.com">Bing.com</a>.<br>Over time, maybe we'll hopefully make some more refinements and make this less a blatant rip-off. After all, this was done on a lark over a weekend.<br>My point in all this is if we as a industry stop copying each other, innovation comes to a grinding halt. It's the basis for the entire process of innovation,as long as we also make improvements and refine on the existing ideas.<br>So I say to you and @Pathetic Idea, I'm not going to stop duplicating ideas. I'm going to duplicate, and try to improve. Sometimes I will fail. But once in a while, I'll succeed. But it's better than not trying at all.<br>I'd love to hear about what innovative things you've done recently.</p>
