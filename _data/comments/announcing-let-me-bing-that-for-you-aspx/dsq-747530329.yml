message: <p>Wow! Can't believe how many people are pissed about "duplicating stuff" and "not original". Don't they realize that most art is copying others? You think everything Bob Ross did was original!? Was the MVC Framework even that original!?  A bunch of haters is all...<br>Anyways, I'm here to actually try to help instead of just criticize your awesome new web app...<br>If you include quotes in your query, it kills the site with a big yellow ASP.NET exception message:<br><a href="http://letmebingthatforyou.com/what%20if%20I%20put%20stuff%20in%20%22quotes%22?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://letmebingthatforyou.com/what%20if%20I%20put%20stuff%20in%20%22quotes%22?">letmebingthatforyou.com/what%20if%20I%20put%20s...</a><br>Hope this helps.</p>
