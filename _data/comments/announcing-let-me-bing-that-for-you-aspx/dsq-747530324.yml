message: <p>I really like your blog and everything you done for <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> community..but, what starting to piss me off, is anything I will see from ms kitchen will be ORIGINAL, EVER? Or it is just gonna be this way, something someone put and create from other companies or open source community and ms get this and create his own version of that. <br>Why do we (f..ng) need another version of this quite imaginative and funny idea, but now for bing search engine? It's a litlle bit pathetic, don't you think? (put on the side that I like it more how you implemented)...so, when it's gonna stop and when we see a new, ORIGINAL stuff coming from MS? :( :(<br>really disappointed<br>Marko<br>p.s. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yj2znbu" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://tinyurl.com/yj2znbu">http://tinyurl.com/yj2znbu</a></p>
