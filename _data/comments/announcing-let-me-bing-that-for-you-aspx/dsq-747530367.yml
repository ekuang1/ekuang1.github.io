message: <p>Wow, I'm amazed at the negative responses to something that you and some buddies spit out in your spare time.<br>Phil, one thing you need to rememeber is that the negative reactions are the vocal minority, most people really don't care about this sort of stuff.  If you make a site that is a parody (or copy) of an existing site and you generate a bit of traffic, then good on you.<br></p>
