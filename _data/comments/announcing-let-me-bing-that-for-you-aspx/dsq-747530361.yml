message: <p>@Marko no hard feelings taken!<br>Honestly, I have no relation to the Bing team or its marketing structure. However, I will admit I like Bing. They have a lot of nice touches (like the picture on the homepage). In fact, I made it the default search engine in Google Chrome. ;)<br>I didn't do this to promote Bing, but to offer choices as I mentioned earlier. For example, if I'm going to be a smart ass to other Microsofties in mail threads, they might prefer the fact that I used Bing (via <a href="http://letmebingthatforyou.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="letmebingthatforyou.com">letmebingthatforyou.com</a>) might soften the sting.<br>This was literally a lark we put together and I didn't mean for it to sound like it was some sort of big deal. Lesson learned for next time as I was quite taken aback by some of the negative reactions I received. But I take it all in stride. :)</p>
