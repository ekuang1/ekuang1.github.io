message: <p>Boy, tough crowd. I must have missed the part in the post that tried to pass letmebingthatforyou off as a totally original idea. At least a few people found it entertaining. I for one had never heard of <a href="http://lmgtfy.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="lmgtfy.com">lmgtfy.com</a>, so now I've got two fun new ways of being a smart ass when "inquisitive idiots" (thanks @Matt Hinze - love it!!) come calling. Thanks!</p>
