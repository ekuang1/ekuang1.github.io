message: <p>Oh come on, nice wordy retort there, but this 'lark' was certainly not an improvement on the original.  It merely recycles someone else's idea in an attempt to pimp bing, and no amount of future changes are going to stop it from being the blat rip-off it is.<br>It's not twitter, or google, or C# so whether they are original or not is immaterial.  Also, why does the commenter have to have done anything original to earn the right to critique?  They are just calling a spade a spade.<br></p>
