message: <p>HI,  My son, John, split his head in July and had to get 5 staples in.  It healed up brilliantly but, for some reason, his scar reopened in September, becames infected, and has not healed since.  He has had numerous visits to the doctor, 4 courses of antibiotics and cannot do his usual things like play rugby and go swimming.  We are becoming extrmely frustrated and anxious now - 3 months on.  It remains infected and is not responding to the antibiotics.  I clean it twice a day with saline solution and sterile gauze.  It looks awful and is oozing yellow pus.  We are going to a consultant on Tuesday Nov 25th and truly hope this will sort it out.  the doc said the wound may need to be thoroughly cleaned up and re stitched.  Does anybody out there share this kind of problem with me and have you any reassurance to offer me?  Thank you,  a worried Mum.</p>
