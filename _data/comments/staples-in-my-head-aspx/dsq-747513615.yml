message: <p>Eight days ago I was taking a shower at school acfter band camp. The floors were just recently waxed and they were soaked from the shower. I stupidly left my shoes and towel across the room. I was walking toward my clothes and I slipped. Both of my feet flew up in the air and I landed on my head. I now have ten staples in my head and I am getting them out tomorrow!</p>
