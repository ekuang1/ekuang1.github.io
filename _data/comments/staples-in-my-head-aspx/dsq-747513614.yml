message: "<p>2 days ago... I'm pregnant with our first and, therefore, clumsier than ever... couldn't have been a cool volleyball injury or something like that... nope, climbing the stairs - window at the top was open and took the corner in the head. With pregnancy hormones rushing... my husband didn't know how to deal with me: crying, bleeding from the head, hysterical - so he took me to the local urgent care clinic and dropped me off to return home and do yard work. His cousin - who is like my sister - came to the clinic to meet me. What he doesn't realize is that ALL emotions are out of whack - so to say he got \"snapped at\" later would be a (well-deserved) understatement. 5 staples, no local - guess this is a good \"welcome\" to motherhood. His cousin told me this is only the beginning... fun being able to use only an ice pack. Guess I see why you should never mess with a momma' bear!</p>"
