message: <p>I lost balance and fell smack dead on cement, head first. Had 5 staples put in for a 2-1/2 inch laceration. Took total of 3 hrs to be discharged after CT scan and stapling. Very painful, hard to sleep. Cannot wait to get them out. People at work want to design me bubble wrap suits and some call me Miss Staples. Very funny!</p>
