message: <p>Hi All! Thanks for your comments.<br>Unfortunately, we don't get to set the pricing on <a href="http://Amazon.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. Amazon often provides a discount on print editions, which has the effect of making the Kindle edition "more expensive" when in reality it's the print edition is "less expensive". I hate that. I think the fact that the Kindle version is just bits shipped over the wire and doesn't require killing trees justifies a lower price. But of course, price is set by supply and demand and it's possible there's more demand for the Kindle edition. Which I guess is a good thing.<br>As for a DRM free version, Our publisher, Wrox, owns the rights to the work. They may have interesting options. I know they've been pretty open to doing Creative Commons and other things in the past.<br>In the future, I hope to either self-publish or work with publishers that are more cutting edge in regards to e-books.<br>I'm sorry for how much of a pain it is today. It really needs to get better.
