message: <p>Phil,<br>I recently coauthored a Wrox book myself "Professional Android Programming with Mono for Android and .NET/C#" and I can totally relate with your post :). It was my first book and plagued with delays and changes. In the end it was worth it, but in the process I asked my wife to smack me if I ever said I wanted to write another book.  However, seeing the fruits of labour, opening that big box of red books (you know the ones you have a small library of from when you learned to code) was the best feeling ever. Maybe even good enough to do it all again!  <br>Anyway, congrats, I'd love to read it!  Looking forward to Monkeyspace and hope to meet you there!</p>
