message: <p>I'm ordering the book for the that chapter alone (I already have the 3rd edition and by comparing the nearly identical table of contents, it doesn't appear that much has changed).<br>The Nuget Gallery code is probably an example of the best "real world sample application" that I've seen for ASP.NET MVC.  It's hard to believe that there aren't more project samples like this available from Microsoft.</p>
