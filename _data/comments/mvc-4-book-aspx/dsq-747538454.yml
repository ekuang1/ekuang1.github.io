message: <p>Awesome, thanks! Just ordered one (wondering why it's so pricey at UK-amazon btw...)<br>I have to say, when you left Microsoft for GitHub, I thought "Oh crap, another great guy has just left the .NET camp". Good to know you're still with us. And I still hope you'll be co-authoring the next book ;)</p>
