In school we're stuck with Java so I used Intellij IDEA, which adds the closing parenthesis as well. It always threw me off my typing game. I'd end up using right arrow or something to get around it.<br><br><br><br>It was little things like that in Intellij that prevented me from using it full time for Java development. I actually used four IDEs for Java stuff: Sun ONE, Eclipse, JBuilder, and Intellij! Each one had something missing. <br><br><br><br>Visual Studio, in contrast, is the only one I use for .NET. It doesn't have everything, but it's not missing very much. And it only gets better with VS 2005, too!</p>"
