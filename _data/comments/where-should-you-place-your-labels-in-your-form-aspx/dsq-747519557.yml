message: <p>The study doesn't seem to take fully into account the situation where the user is repeatedly shown the same form i.e. multiple times a day, every day. I would hypothesise that in such cases, the user will learn the meaning of each field and simply never look at the labels again and thus, it's would be more important to have the fields closer together so the user could review their input more quickly. In those situations right aligned labels make more sense.<br>Also, if there are more than say 9 fields, the form area would be too long. People can absorb width better than height (otherwise I'd have my 3 monitors stacked :).<br>Nice blog btw, I enjoy your writing.</p>
