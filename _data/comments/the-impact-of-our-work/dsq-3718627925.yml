message: <p>Thanks for this. I've been writing code for around 28 years, 17 of those professionally. Ticked a lot of the boxes of success in all the roles - academia, investment banking, booming startups, leading and coaching teams and so on. Part way into my career I started wondering - "am I doing good? is what I'm doing actually useful for humanity, or at the very least, not causing damage?". The question nagged at me for years, until I eventually figured that "getting ahead" and dominating the world and being number one was less important than the quality of my day to day experience, and whether I could help to improve that quality for other humans - in all the ways, not just profit and convenience.</p><p>It's hard to be a good human, which is why so many of us put that consideration to one side in favour of just being the best at X. I think my broader lens stems from my original education as a physicist, where I was trained to think about the very big picture (the entire universe) from the beginning. Is there something about a CS education that narrows minds? (genuine question)</p><p>I build websites for dentists and other small businesses these days. A far cry from the "big data before there was big data" stuff I used to do. But I'm generally, genuinely useful as a result, with what I feel to be a minimal social cost. I work on some other bigger picture, wellbeing oriented stuff in my spare time.</p><p>How conscious in general are developers  "of the impact of our work on others"?</p>
