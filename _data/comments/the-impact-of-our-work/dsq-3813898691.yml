message: <p>I also went to a small liberal arts school and am currently working as a software engineer. I find that  getting others who have more technical focus to even entertain the idea of a more human, wholistic team approach to anything will result in better quality code and more productive employees is challenging. You are very right in saying that these "Soft skills" are actually very hard! I think that is why many people ignore them. New tech and code is easy to learn. It has rules and is logical. People are harder and require constant self and team evaluation and a lot of time. And hey, if it ain't broke...</p>
