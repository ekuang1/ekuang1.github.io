message: <p>That's weird, I had the opposite experience.  I found it hard to get my printer to work on my new MAC.  Their list of supported printers seems a lot smaller than list supported by windows.  There are some pretty obvious reasons for this but without resources like linux <a href="http://printing.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="printing.org">printing.org</a> and the open source community in general I suspect they would be in a worse position.<br>The one thing that they do do better is the actual networking bit, so I guess that the ads are technically correct.  I noticed that my new MAC supports almost every protocol for connecting to a printer out of the box.  On older windows systems I would have to install things like LPD printing from the OS CD.  The MAC comes with everything from AppleTalk through LPD to Windows printer sharing out of the box.</p>
