message: <p>"...the U.S. will win the World Cup...". Let's not go TOO far off into fantasy land.<br>Now, I plug my wifes 6 year old HP USB scanner into my iBook and it doesn't recognize it at all. Do some research online and you find out they don't plan to support it EVER. You can supposedly get it running using SANE and some other OSS.<br>But that is another benefit, in my mind, of OS X. It doesn't tease you and let you think that your device MIGHT work if only you were smarter/younger/thinner/better-looking. Windows does. Windows pops up a dialog saying, "I found something boss. Can you tell me what it is?" Smashing the myth of USB devices (remember the windows 95 demos that had you plugging in a USB device and having it all "just work. "(unless you happened to be Bill G., then it would blue screen and provide anti-MS forces with a great video clip for years to come)). So you put in the CD that came with the device, assuming you have it. Otherwise you are off on the great internet device driver hunt. ("Well, this one lists devices with a model number one greater and one smaller than mine. Will it work? What does it mean when it says "model number HPX78-xxx"?"). OS X just ignores the device all together. Giving you the oppportunity to return the device quickly.<br>See, kids. You can spin anything. :)</p>
