message: <p>&gt; Interesting. Why would they decide never to support it? I guess the moral of the story is that NEITHER company is committed to making it JUST WORK.<br>The only way this EVER works is if the same company sells you both devices.<br>Eg, iTunes / Xbox360 / Playstation2 model.<br>Everything else is just smoke, mirrors, and the vague hope that everyone involved does the right thing at all possible times.</p>
