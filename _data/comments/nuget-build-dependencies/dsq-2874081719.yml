message: <p>Coming from a java world where build and dependency management is mature..it was a shock trying to implement devops/ continuous integration on a .net platform. In my opinion .net needs to follow the maven way where build and dependency management are first class citizens along with a bunch of conventions and archtetypes to build a typical .net artifact</p>
