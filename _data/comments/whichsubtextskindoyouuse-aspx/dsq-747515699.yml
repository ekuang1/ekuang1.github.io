message: <p>A slightly modified AnotherEon001 (added Technorati, Google Analytics, FeedBurner, and the Site Search from another skin (can't remember which).  It's not my favorite skin, but it was easier to start mods from (though I can't remember why!).<br>Things like Technorati or Google Analytics are difficult to add since they require changes to a skin.  On a multi-blog site, you would be "stealing" the skin so others couldn't use it anymore.  I hope with Skins 2.0 it will be easier to have blog-specific mods.</p>
