message: <p>AnotherEon001 with very little customization.  Because it's simple.<br>Haackify was too you :)<br>Redbook was too narrow<br>Keywest, Piyo, Semagogy were all great but I found one thing or another I didn't like about them.<br>Origami is too much. (looks fantastic though)<br>I probably will go custom eventually but I think I'll wait until subtext goes 2.0 (ASP.NET that is)</p>
