  Is this only an encoding problem when you upload files?

  Users can give such "weird" names to their files. For example, in France we have accents, and I've already seen names like: "Aperçus de l'été (2019).Jpg". In this case, it ' better to start by "normalizing" the file name to get something like: "apercus-de-l-e-2019.jpg"
