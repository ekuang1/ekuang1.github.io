message: Microsoft URLs tend to include parentheses, which some Markdown/CommonMark systems handle better than others. And there are certain pre- and post-processing systems that may not like certain other symbols, but none of these URL escaping methods are aggressive enough to avoid these issues, so I wrote a powershell script to update a URL on the clipboard. https://github.com/brianary/scripts/blob/master/Format-EscapedUrl.ps1
