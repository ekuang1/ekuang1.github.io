message: <p>the coreteam have been discussing this recently to see if we can support both models. We feel it's key to support the existing model, as it allows developers to use the free visual web developer express, which is important, but would also like to support WAP as well. Ideally we'll be able to automate the conversion between the 2 models. Shaun should be blogging the details once we've evaluated it.<br>By the way, I believe Shaun experienced the problems with cassini with a pre-release version of <a href="http://vs.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="vs.net">vs.net</a> 2005, I've used it on the release version without issue.</p>
