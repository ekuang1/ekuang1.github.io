message: <p>It's been almost a year since this was posted and I'm interested in doing this for an upcoming MVC 2.0 project, so I was wondering if anyone has tried using this technique for a real application.  I posted a question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2457164/storing-asp-net-mvc-views-in-the-database" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2457164/storing-asp-net-mvc-views-in-the-database">StackOverflow</a>, so any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>
