message: "<p>i figured out in that edit_area editor how to make the syntax highlight. it's pretty easy actually.<br>you just create a new .js file (copy a similar existing one like html.js) and add your own highlight logic and instead of doing a 'color: #ff0000', you just do a 'background-color: #ff0000'.<br>hope this helps somebody.</p>"
