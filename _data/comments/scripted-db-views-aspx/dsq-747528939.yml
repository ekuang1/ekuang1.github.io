message: <p>Wow. This has got to be one of the worst ideas I've read about in a while. I'll be honest, I've read your site before (a long time ago) and decided that it wasn't to my liking, but promoting such a dynamic strategy in our language, and the numerous resulting issues that could come from this implementation (that you haven't raised) it really disturbs me. I know that won't mean anything, but I'm just fairly shocked. And it is even more disturbing that so many people seem to like it. I think someone such as yourself, who numerous people seem to respect, should *at the very least* comment on the downsides of such an implementation, because they are significant.<br>I realise this was posted a while ago, so maybe you've commented on it since then; I hope so. Regardless, amongst the claims of joy and brilliance about this system, I'd like to express my disgust.</p>
