message: <p>Well, Jimmy beat me to it. Razor is a templating engine. Using Razor for outbound HTML-formatted emails is awesome. But adding a cache/nocache Razor-level directive doesn't really make sense in this case.<br>You could just as easily create an extension such as <code>@using (Html.Cache.NoCache) { }</code> or <code>@using (Html.Cache.FromSeconds(15) { }</code> to accomplish what you want.</p>
