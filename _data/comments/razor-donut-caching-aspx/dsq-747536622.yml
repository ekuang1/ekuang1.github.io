message: <p>A good cache should allow the developer to investigate the hits and misses so parameters can be adjusted accordingly.<br>I think a better design would be to simply have extension methods that can do the caching. This can enable extensibility too. I may want to use the Windows AppFabric for my cache. The freedom to override some of the behavior would be easier if Razor view engine remains untouched.<br></p>
