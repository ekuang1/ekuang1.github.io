message: <p>Hey all, remember that the discussion is about a syntax for ASP.NET Output Caching declarable within Razor. So things like using AppFabric for the cache would be covered by <em>existing</em> extensibility points for output caching.<br>I'll have to check with Andrew Nurse to see if a directive can be "layered" on so that the core Razor doesn't have it, but Razor for Web does.</p>
