message: <p>Unfortunately the case at hand has more to do with politics than either ethics or business.  However, you make a good point that company managers are finding it more difficult to determine who exactly they represent.<br><br><br><br>Your point that Enron is an example of company management purely representing the interest of the shareholders is misleading.  In that case, management represented its own interest and not the shareholders or the employees.  The result, was that both the shareholders and employees (who overlapped because employee pensions were held in Enron shares) lost their shirts while management became rich.<br><br><br><br>Company managers should represent their shareholders' interests (as Enron did not).  In most cases, they will find that their "stakeholders" (employees, suppliers, neighbors etc.) are better off with a vibrant growing company.  Problem arise when company managers are dishonest - then everyone suffers, most notably the shareholders, but also the employees and the environment.<br><br><br><br>Whose job is it to protect the environment and prevent sweatshop labor?  That is the government's job.  Figuring out environmental and labor policy is hard enough for public policy experts, let alone for companies who are in the business of maing a profit, not determining policy.  Once environmental and labor laws have been decided, company managers should and must openly and honestly follow them.  If we count on companies on their own to protect the environment and prevent sweatshops, we will be sorely disapointed.  <br><br><br><br>As for the specific employment law issues in this case, the law at issue is more symbolic than anything else.  The general rule is "at will employment", but a company has the burden of showing a non-discriminatory reason for letting go of an employee in a protected class.  So far, these include women, minorities, and anyone over 50.  Eventually, we will all find ourselves in a protected class (even if it means waiting until we are 50).  Adding other group to the list or protected classes will just mean a company will have to make sure there are a couple bad reviews before they fire a person in that class.  Of course, this does not diminish the symbolism inherent in Microsoft's change of policy - and symbols are important.  Considering its past representations, Microsoft was weak to change its policy as a result of political pressure.</p>
