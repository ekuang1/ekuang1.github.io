message: <p>Randy, I'd totally agree with that statement.  In fact, in truth, I actually believe that acting selfishly with does require acting in the common good.  <br><br><br><br>But in practice, I don't see that being the case.  Often, people and corporations act selfishly with limited forethought, wisdom, insight, etc...  It's this focus on the short term gain that's the problem.<br><br><br><br>My theory could be restated that always acting selfishly with perfect (or very good) knowledge of long term effects will benefit the common good.  But much like many theoritical laws, it doesn't exactly describe the real world.</p>
