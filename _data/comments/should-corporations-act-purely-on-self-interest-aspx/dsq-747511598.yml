message: <p>I'd argue that Microsoft's act isn't in the best interest of its shareholders if it disillusions some of its top employees and causes an increased brain drain.<br><br><br><br>As for making policy, I'm not advocating that companies make policies.  I agree, that's the gonvernment's job.  This isn't a question of whether Microsoft should create policy but whether they should have continued to extend support for a policy that they already support internally.<br><br><br><br>It's obvious corporations have legislative agendas.  Microsoft's claim was that it was trimming its own, not cutting it completely.  I'd hardly argue that companies should completely stay out of lending support or withholding support to legislative bills.  Corporations pay taxes, they have the right to participate.</p>
