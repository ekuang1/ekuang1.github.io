message: <p>Funny that you used Dare's code as a reference...funny because I used *your* BlogThisUsingWBloggar plugin code to write one for PostXING :)<br>The thing that I added to the mix was to make the xsl customizable...OOB it will just use the embedded resources. If it's configured, it will save your super awesome xsl style sheet per-user, per-machine.</p>
