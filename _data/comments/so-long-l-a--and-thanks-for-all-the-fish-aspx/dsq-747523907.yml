message: <p>Well, Seattle has great camping, great skiing and snowboarding, and protests almost every day. In fact some protests have counter-protests and the counter-protests have counter protests. I think the only city with more protests is San Francisco. ;) AND we've got pro soccer on the way.<br>3 out of 4 isn't bad.</p>
