message: <p>Oh, guys, I have just read Rob's post and yours, and I am missing San Diego now (I spent a year there). I also liked LA when I visited it. I really like your second picture with the sky, the traffic lights and the palm trees, I have some similar ones.<br>Good luck in Seattle. I hope you don't miss CA too much.<br></p>
