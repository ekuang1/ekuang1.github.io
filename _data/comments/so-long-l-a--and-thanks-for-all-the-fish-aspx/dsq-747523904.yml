message: <p>Having grown up in LA, I have to tell you I miss it a lot. People give this place a very hard time (smoggy, crowded, shallow people, etc) but outside of New York, I don't think there is a sense of "chic" in any other city in the US.<br>I relocated to SF for 15 years and missed the LA weather terribly. I also found that, as "shallow" as LA people can be, they smile a lot more than our Nor Cal friends and aren't so self-righteous :). That's right NoCal - I took a swipe! No water for YOU!<br>Seriously - Good luck Phil (and Akumi and Cody). Seattle is a beautiful place (really beautiful 3 months out of the year)! And if you ever feel down, just know that I'll be there every other month to crash on your floor :).</p>
