  String interpolation is great and all, but you are still bound by your expressions' scopes, so you can't have something like:

  public const string MyNamedFormat = $"Name is: {name}";

  I'd like to see it beefed up a bit so that you can let the compiler fill it in, *or* you can provide values for any of the (named) specifiers.
