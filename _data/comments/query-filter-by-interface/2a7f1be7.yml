  @Cristov√£o Morgado I don't know. I'm just using the built-in Global Query Filter feature of EF Core. My guess is if your `FromSql` query is composable, then it will work. But if it's not composable, then it won't. For example, if you call a stored procedure using `FromSql` I don't see how it could work.



  Why don't you try it out and report back!
