message: <p><br>We're going through this with our wamu biz account as well, but with some odder points:<br>We once deposited 6 items at once into the ATM, all endorsed as usual, in the following amounts:<br>$50<br>$75<br>$250<br>$650<br>$2,000<br>$3,400<br>very typical deposit for us. Only two of the six (the 2k and 3.4k) were sent back for a missing endorsement - all were signed identically.<br>We've just had a similar batch get a returned item -- sure enough, a batch of about $3k worth are accepted fine, but a single large-item check (5k this time) is returned for having "no endorsement".<br>I haven't gotten any of the Wamu drones to figure out what the new policy is and tell me yet -- we're switching to a rubber stamp for endorsements (should've done it by now, we just had other things to do -- and don't mind writing them by hand) -- but is this new policy anywhere online to be found? I'll use this article to shake the information loose from them on Monday, and see what else we need to do.<br>Total pain in the ass, as mentioned.  Somewhat disconcerting how all of the bank managers I complain to just shrug it off as "well, we're just retarded I guess! tee hee!"<br>Thanks for posting your discovery -- was starting to think we were alone.<br> - Mike<br></p>
