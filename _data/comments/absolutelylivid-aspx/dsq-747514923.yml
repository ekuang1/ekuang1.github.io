message: <p>I am out over $3,000 on the 4th of July because of this!!! Yesterday I dropped off a check in the atm, knowing it was early enough that it would be available today, a holiday...however, I look at my account, and it shows a reversal for a missing endorsement!!! I have deposited over 1000 checks with no signature at Wamu, literally because I started doing it, they never commented back, and so it continued...I have a strange feeling about this- as I have about 6-7 online payments that will be going through in the next day or so...and I've called customer service, I will be responsible for all overdraft fees...RI-DI-CU-LOUS....I will be closing my account as soon as I have that check in my hand...I've been with WAMU for 9 years now, and I should have done this long ago...</p>
