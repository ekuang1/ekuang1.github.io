message: '<p>I am in precisely the same predicament with Wamu (now at three checks in a row).  I have changed the endorsement based on what the people at my local "Financial Center" (Wamu-speak for bank branch) told me and I am still getting rejected.  This is after going through three-months of them holding thousands of dollars in limbo for up to three business weeks to "recover funds from the issuer of the check".  I am going in there tomorrow morning and telling them what I think about their new endorsement policy.  <br>Aside: I have been a long-time customer with BofA for personal finance; no real problems.  I switched to BofA after a long time at Wells after they started charging me for every little thing on my accounts. I opened a business account at Wamu and have had nothing but troubles.</p>'
