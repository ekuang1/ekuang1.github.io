message: <p>OH MY GOD.<br>After reading these, my stomach began to feel funny.<br>I forgot to endorse a check and deposited it into a BoA ATM, and they charged me friggin 25 dollars for the returned item, and on top of it, they charged everything that i used after depositing the check (full four days after, mind you) as over draft. <br>OH MY GAD. And I don't have the check in my hand. Wow, i am really really pissed off.</p>
