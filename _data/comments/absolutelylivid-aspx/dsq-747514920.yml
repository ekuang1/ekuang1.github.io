message: <p>Wachovia Bank, the 4th largest in the US, just bought Golden State Bank (based in CA, duh!) to get into the West Coast market.  I've been with Wachovia in Connecticut for about 8 months now and they have been awesome.  Great customer service, excellent online banking, limited bullshit.  No guarantee that they'll be able to transmit their corporate philosophy to Golden State, but it might happen. <br>Chris</p>
