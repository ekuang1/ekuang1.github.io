message: <p>I ran across this and had to share my experience. I too was livid to find out that my business account had been sacked one morning when WAMU had removed funds from my business account to the tune of 10K. This was for a check that had been deposited and cleared!!!! the week prior. For the month prior every deposit I made had a different hold period applied to it ranging from 1 day to 15 days (for the same size checks). It was the last straw when they pulled funds from my account for a cleared check. <br>Their explanation was there was no endorsment on the back of it. But the check had already cleared and been made available in my account and I had already spent half of the funds. I was met with a string of lame excuses (non of which could be substantiated). I screamed at them for an hour causing new potential customers to leave the bank. THen I closed all of my accounts and moved to citibank.<br>I have not endorsed a check for deposit ever in 6 years. Its not a requirement if you are the payee and can verify your identity. WAMU has gone bankrupt and they are most likely trying to delay funds to compensate for major accounting flaws that they have made.</p>
