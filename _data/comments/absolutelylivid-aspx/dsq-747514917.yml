message: <p>The same bank (WAMU) requires a paper form to set up direct deposit. <br>They put a hold on withdrawals after a check has been deposited, but will allow you to cash a check immediately. On one occasion, Micah cashed out a 14K check, then deposited the bills directly to his account to bypass the 5 day hold. What a goofy system.<br>The banking industry, like the music and movie industries before them, is just begging for disintermediation. They're incredibly inefficient and arrogant, so when better solutions come along we'll be more than happy to dump them. <br>C'mon, PayPal, mint your own currency! How's that data haven on Kinakuta progressing?</p>
