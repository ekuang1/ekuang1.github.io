message: "<p>This helps, but the problem I'm facing is most packaged software does not do that themselves.  And their functions load last.<br>I had to give up and found 2 other ways to do it that work in most browsers:<br>setInterval:<br><code><br>function x() {<br>    if(divexists) {<br>        //perform ops<br>        clearInterval(mytimer);<br>    }<br>}<br>var mytimer = setInterval('x()', 250);<br></code><br>what I am finding is this runs only once in most versions of FF :-((<br>so I'm using this function for now:<br><code><br>function x() {<br>   if(document.getElementById('...')) {<br>      // do operations<br>   } else {<br>      //if we still dont have our DOM, wait and try again.<br>      setTimeout('x()', 200);<br>   }<br>}<br>setTimeout('x()', 500);<br></code><br>This effectively lets me run multiple window.onload operations without having to worry about what hijacks the onload method after my code is done.  NOTE:  you MUST use the quote marks in the setTimeout() call in the function!!  This prevents the \"too much recursion\" error in F.F. by forcing the recursed function call to be evaluated by the browser each call.</p>"
