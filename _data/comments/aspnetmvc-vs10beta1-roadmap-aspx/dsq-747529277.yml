message: <p>Visual Studio 2010 is allowing me to add classic <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> controls to views and it works! Is this supposed to be a new feature or a bug? If it is a bug then can it turned into a feature as it would be really cool to use best of both worlds :)</p>
