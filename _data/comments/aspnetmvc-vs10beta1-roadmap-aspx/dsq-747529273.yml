message: '<p>Re Roadmap: I think a full end to end validation framework is critical for the enterprise. We need to have a validation framework thats can be defined once and can be re-used throughout the layers, UI, Controllers and Models.<br>This will also touch on the productivity areas...NO repetition of validation code which is so common in development.<br></p>'
