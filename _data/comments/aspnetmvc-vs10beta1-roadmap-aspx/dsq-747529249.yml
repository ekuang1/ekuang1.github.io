message: <p>@Haacked<br>Yes, I am able to do this - but during runtime, no matter what I pass through, I get the same error that "Model" does not implement GetEnumerator. <br>Copying the same code into Visual Studio 2008 runs just fine. I've yet to make an example work - even the default MVC project in Visual Studio 2010.<br>At first I thought it was my own types, so I tried to follow the NerdDinner example and see how that fared. I got the same results. Somewhere in translation it seems something went wrong with the change to .dll 1.1.0.0. Please forgive me, I don't profess to be an expert on MVC enough to tell. <br>I thought it was perhaps my own installation - so I went home after work and installed it all on a fresh machine running Windows Vista SP2 without Visual Studio 2008 even installed. The only install .NET is .NET 4 beta and Visual Studio 2010 beta 1, no SQL server installed - just remoting into another one. I encountered the same result.<br>"object type Model does not implement GetEnumerator" in any attempt to use the Model helper in a View Page.</p>
