message: <p>Pretty cool. Google is pretty crazy as far as their hiring practices go. I have a friend who works for them down in Atlanta. Also the company I work for has a big project that Google is partnering with us on. Even though we did all the preliminary coding on the project now that we are working with Google on this you can only work on it if you pass all of Google's tests. And let me tell you these aren't easy tests at all. They are really really tough.</p>
