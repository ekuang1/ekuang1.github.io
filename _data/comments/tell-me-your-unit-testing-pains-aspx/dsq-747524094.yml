message: "<p>For me, testing is all about my ability to fake, mock, or stub other code.  When I test a method, all I want to test is that method -- nothing else.  The problem occurs when that method calls anther method in the same class -- I can't fake out that call, not easily anyway.  So now I have to account for the method I'm calling, the method it is calling, and so on and so forth.<br>Constructors can also be a problem.  You try to keep your constructors as simple as possible, just pass in any dependencies and let the work happen.  It isn't always possible.  A typical issue is you have to hook up an event in the constructor.  It just make setting up a mock object...interesting.<br>Next, static singletons.  These are often used in the place of globals for an application, holding special values (connection strings, etc).  A static singleton can't be mocked (not by Rhino Mocks anyway -- my favorite tool so far).<br>Finally: trying to explain to another developer what a stub, fake, and a mock are.  I've had many occasions where just pounding my head against the wall would have been more fruitful.</p>"
