message: <p>@Scott I'm involved in Framework-wide discussions, not just ASP.NET MVC. Hence the request for feedback.<br>Even if this were limited to ASP.NET, I don't see how asking for more feedback is a cause of dismay. I've been doing TDD and ASP.NET for years and have tons of battle scars in doing so and the "hard-won experience" you mentioned. That doesn't mean I've run into *every* possible testability problem.<br>My problems are not necessarily your problems. etc... etc...<br>So I welcome feedback across the board. :)<br>Phil</p>
