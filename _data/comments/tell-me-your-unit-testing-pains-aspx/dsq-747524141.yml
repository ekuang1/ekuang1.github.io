message: <p>Hey..We have developed a portal where we kept our bussiness logic into .XSD File and for creating the Unit Test Case we placed the file in APP_Code Folder.But  while creating unit test case for any method defined in a class which in turn accesing that .XSD file an exception occured.So we place that file into APP_Data Folder but after that we can't access the logic written in that .XSD file while creating test cases.<br>Please suggest..</p>
