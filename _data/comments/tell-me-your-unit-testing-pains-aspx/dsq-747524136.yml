message: <p>Testing ASP.NET pipe line is somewhat similiar in experience to using a sandpaper for whiping oneself. It's doable, but the process is mildly pleasing.<br>Half of the public classes have internal constructors and half of the overloads are internal as well. The novelty of things like AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData(".appDomain", "*") never wears off.<br></p>
