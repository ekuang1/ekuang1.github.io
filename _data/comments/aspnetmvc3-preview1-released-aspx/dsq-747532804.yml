message: <p>@haacked @matt<br>Well I don't know how things are done in mvc tooling but I don't see any reason that the tooling has to be .net 4 dependent, but even assuming that it is... wait.. just notice I can't develop .net 4 app with vs2008 (I was pretty sure I could)... hmmm... that sucks... well... keep up the great work and I'll check mvc3 sometime in the future ;)</p>
