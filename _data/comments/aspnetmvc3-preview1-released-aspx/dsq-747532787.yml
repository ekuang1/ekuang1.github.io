message: <p>@Miechu Unfortunately they said that MVC 3 takes a dependency on .NET 4 so VS 2008 support won't be coming.<br>@Haacked Downloading now! Looking forward to the metadata and validation improvements... the complex validation I have in my app using MVC 2 has grown to become some of my least favorite code, I will branch and spike out MVC 3 to see how much it could clean up the code.<br>Thanks for the preview!<br>-Matt</p>
