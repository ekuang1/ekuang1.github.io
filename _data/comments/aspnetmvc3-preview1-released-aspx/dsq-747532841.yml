message: <p><br>Actually I've found a way to avoid the bugs with these previews and such, I avoid them and wait for the released product. Sure I read up on the details about the upcoming features but to seriously try and use them? Never.  Only time I did that was for ASP.NET 1.0 itself, and only because it was so much of an improvement over ASP.</p>
