message: <p>I am running into the same problem as Felipe. Whenever I add a &lt;%@ Import Namespace=... %&gt; to an apsx page the Model loses whatever it's type was and reverts back to being a plain old object.  Any work arounds for this other than the obvious (don't use import) or am I doing something wrong here?</p>
