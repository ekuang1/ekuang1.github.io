message: <p>Advanta Business Card is the worst.  they fail to disclose on their web site  which touts cash-back of 5% on all computer purchases and gasoline purchases that this is a tiered benefit card and that kind of a rebate does not apply until you charge more than $125,000 in a year.  Only if you read the fine print on the disclosure statement that they must by law send you, do they disclose that it is tiered.  It took me a year to tumble to the fact that I was receiving only about 1/4% on my purchases and a phone call to customer service to discover this.  A pox on their house.  My revenge is to quit using their card except about once every 3 months and then for a $5 purchase which costs them more to process than they get from me. The moral is to read the fine print and do business with those whose advertising truly represents how they do business.  <br>Vern</p>
