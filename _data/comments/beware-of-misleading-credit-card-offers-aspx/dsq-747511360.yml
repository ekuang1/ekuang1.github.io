message: "<p>I can empathise with these comments to a large degree.  I would hope and even depend on the Representatives statements over the perplexing jargon that is seen in this fine print of Credit card fine print.  I believe it is the jobs of our state and federal representatives to have credit card companies send out information that is \"understandable by the normal person.\"  Though I do have some buisness background and a college degree the language is such that, credit cards can change the rules at any time they want and/or make you pay a ton of money without you even realizing that this is infact a contract that you are signing off on.  I have paid some attention to the rising trend of financial institutions and credit agencies.  The biggest tip off are those asterisks ********** or there numbers that look like ^1 or ^2.  These are indicative of \"hey would you like to be screwed, come on sucker sign me, i am a liar and a thief?\"  Indeed I see this used with APR and FREE  ****<br><br><br><br><br><br>Secondly I am going to pick on CitiBank which has terrible customer service, and they give you offers then they decide not to give it to you.  For instance they offered me to use my credit card 3 times and I would get a $5 credit to my account.  You have probably recieved some sort of offer like this in the mail.  Well they never sent me the money I complained opened an investigation, and no word so far.  But for these two reasons I am going to pick on them. <br><br><br><br>I picked a CitiBank credit card example for the asterisks example.<br><br><br><br>\" *The APR for balances transferred is 0%. Provided you keep your CitiBusiness® Card Account and Citibank Card Accounts in good standing, this rate will be in effect for 12 months from account opening. Thereafter, the balance transfer APR will revert to the APR then in effect for purchases. Purchase APR: the U.S. Prime Rate plus 4.99% (10.99% APR as of May 6, 2005). Cash Advance APR: 20.99%. If you fail to keep your CitiBusiness® Card Account or Citibank Card Accounts in good standing, the Default Rate equals the U.S. Prime Rate plus up to 23.99% (29.99% APR as of May 6, 2005). Min. Finance Charge: $0.50. For each purchase made in a foreign currency, we add an additional FINANCE CHARGE of 3.0% of the amount of the purchase after its conversion into U.S. dollars. This foreign currency transaction fee will be added to the appropriate purchase balance with the foreign currency purchase. The foreign currency transaction fee may cause the annual percentage rate on the billing statement on which the purchase made in a foreign currency first appears to exceed the nominal annual percentage rate. Transaction Fee for Cash Advances: 3% of the amount of each cash advance, $5 minimum. Transaction Fee for Balance Transfers: 3% of the amount of each balance transfer, $5 minimum, $50 maximum. However, there is no balance transfer transaction fee on balances you transfer in response to this offer. There is no annual fee.\"<br><br><br><br>Of course this is just one I picked randomly and there are of couse many more complicated ones while this is in say size 6 font the free stuff is in say 22 font.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Solution:  To the credit card companies, Show me in clear non- technical jargon what I will have to pay in any and every circumstance and make it short. <br><br><br><br>Due to the fact that I am not a politician I cannot change these rules nor an influencial part of the financial districts.  All these are true but actions must be made or the 'little man\" will be taken advantage of by those that wish to profit.</p>"
