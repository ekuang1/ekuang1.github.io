message: <p>I tried to get a credit card from Chase once. I dicided to send online credit card application at <a href="http://www.bestcreditoffers.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.bestcreditoffers.com">http://www.bestcreditoffers...</a> I’m strongly against getting into any kind of debt, but recently I learned that a person needs to have a credit history in this country to survive. Being without one, I opted for a secured credit card. Here’s how the entire thing went:<br>1. I sent in the application. I’ve had a premium account (min. balance of $10,000) with Chase for 2 years at that point.<br>2. Two weeks later I get back a request to send a copy of my driver’s license; I do so the same day.<br>3. Two weeks later I get a request to send a copy of my social security card; I do so the same day.<br>4. Two weeks later I get a rejection and my check back (for a secured CC you need to send the money in advance).<br>5. A week later I get accepted, but the letter states that because I didn’t send any money in advance I cannot get a card, and I should apply again.<br>The next day I closed my Chase account. I wouldn’t want to trust my money to a bank that’s got such a mess in their paperwork.<br></p>
