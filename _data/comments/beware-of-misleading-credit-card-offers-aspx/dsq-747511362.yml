message: "<p>I'm afraid I've never seen a credit card that didn't say that all payments made would go to the lower interest rate loan first.  It's been that way since I actually worked for a credit card back in 1990.  Same with cash advance vs purchase - cash adv usually has a higher 2nd rate than purchases, and all payments go to pay off purchases before cash advances.  Only way to get rid of a cash advance rate is to pay the card off in full.<br><br><br><br>I got one for you though that a credit card company tried to pull on me this year.  I signed up for an Advanta card in 1/03.  When I opened it, I was told the card was X% above prime (forget the exact).  Used it normal till about 7/04, when I finally gave in and took them up on their millionth balance transfer offer.  Don't you know, same month as I transfer in $1000's (went to like $9500 bal) with the promise of 0% interest for 6 months, my old balance (~$4000) gets shot up to 20%!  It was 8-9% since the day I opened it, and now they were trying to take me for 20% after I paid them $50 to consolidate my cards!<br><br><br><br>I tried for 3 months to get this reduced back where it was.  I got every excuse in the book, including that I had missed a payment by a day somewhere.  It was all BS, and I called them on it.  That's when they came up with an excuse that they had sent me a letter saying I had 10 days to close the card or I accepted 20% interest from then on!  They never sent me this letter, and they claimed it was too bad I didn't get it, but they wouldn't reduce the interest.<br><br>I stopped paying them and sent them a letter saying they breached our agreement.  They called every day trying to collect, refusing to drop the 20% interest.  I still didn't pay.  They never reported me to the credit bureau, so I couldn't sue them (no damages).  Then at 7 months past due, they offered to \"forgive\" half the balance if I would just pay it and go away (they had paid collectors to call daily for 6 months, and would have had to pay even more for outside continued collection or lawyers).  I walked away MAKING $4000 off of them without needing to go to court or hiring a lawyer, and they can't put it on my credit report.<br><br><br><br>MORAL:  they MUST inform you properly if they change your rate (on the statement).  If they ever claim they sent it seperate, you can fight them.  Never say to them you'll never pay.  Tell them you won't pay until they fix their breech of contract.  It's not refusal to pay, which they can sue you for.... it's your legal right to freeze the agreement when they change terms without both sides consent.</p>"
