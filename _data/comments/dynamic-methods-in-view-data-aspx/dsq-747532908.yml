message: <p>I second (or third) the comments that this violates Separation of Concerns, however useful it is. The properties are one thing, but invoking method from the view seems to be a violation or at the least a slippery slope.<br>Since you asked about a name (and not our opinion about the feature), I'd simple call DynamicData or DynamicView or something to that effect.<br>-Jeff</p>
