message: <p>Its been a while since I looked at the dynamic stuff and my understanding was that as long as a class implemented IDynamicMetaObjectProvider then C# would let you access dynamic members on it while still having Intellisense for the static members.<br>I've had a closer look now and I can see that even if a class implements the interface you have to cast the object to "dynamic" before it lets you access anything dynamically.<br>Maybe they could add that in C# 5? I'm used to interchanging obj["property"] and <a href="http://obj.property" rel="nofollow noopener" title="obj.property">obj.property</a> in JavaScript and its often quite useful.<br></p>
