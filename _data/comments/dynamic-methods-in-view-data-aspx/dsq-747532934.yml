message: <p>ViewData is the only sensible place. Otherwise you have two  properties doing the same thing. That isn't tidy!<br>It isn't strong typing and it will have its issues if it isn't used right. But, I guess if you get the name wrong with a dictionary like ViewData["foo"] then it's the same.<br>I vote for a breaking change too.</p>
