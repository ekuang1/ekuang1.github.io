message: <p>Given that these are dynamic properties, presumably we won't get the helping hand of intellisense?  Just a little concerned that splitting work between developers working on the Controller and those on the View may bring in extra bugs related to typos on the property names.<br>Other than that, great little addition making for some very pretty code!</p>
