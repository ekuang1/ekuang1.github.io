message: <p>@Anton<br>I think ViewContext is already used somewhere.<br>In my opinion DataContext sounds too much like LINQtoSQL and I don't like the name much in WPF. Please don't suggest that! You got any other suggestions? I'd rather DataContext be called Model in WPF. That's exactly what it is (though I guess 9 times out of 10 it is ViewModel...)<br>It is only my opinion, wait for the raft of people thinking "yeah, data-context is a brilliant idea! Plus I'm not liking WPF much at the moment, you can't easily run commands on GridViews or DataGrids?! Grrrr... That might be influencing my response somewhat...<br>I still think we need a vote.<br>1.) ViewContext <br>2.) DataContext<br>3.) ViewData<br>4.) Add your own suggestion...<br>Come on Haack, you've build your own blog engine and architected ASP.NETonRails... Why don't you just have an open Vote.</p>
