message: <p>For the ViewData question I would steer clear of ViewModel as it is confusing as that term usually refers to custom classes for passing structured data to the view.  I think just sticking with the ViewData usage for both the controller and View is not that bad, it's just a few more characters and has some historical precedent that is familiar to the users.<br>Cheers,<br>Turnkey</p>
