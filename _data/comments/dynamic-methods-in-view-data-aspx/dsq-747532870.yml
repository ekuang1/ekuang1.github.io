message: <p>A couple of people have suggested in the comments of this <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Glucose/Hanselminutes-on-9-ASPNET-MVC-3-and-NEW-ASPNET-Futures-with-Phil-Haack-and-Morgan-the-Intern/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Glucose/Hanselminutes-on-9-ASPNET-MVC-3-and-NEW-ASPNET-Futures-with-Phil-Haack-and-Morgan-the-Intern/">Hanselminutes-on-9</a> video that the ViewData dictionary could implement <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.dynamic.idynamicmetaobjectprovider.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.dynamic.idynamicmetaobjectprovider.aspx">IDynamicMetaObjectProvider</a> so that keys added to ViewData could be accessed as properties dynamically.<br>I haven't tested it myself to see if it works but it seems to me that combining the ViewData/ViewModel properties together would make things easier to understand? It would also eliminate the problem of what to call the new ViewModel property.</p>
