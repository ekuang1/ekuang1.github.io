  It's not just a problem for package managers. A few examples from other fields:



  - SourceForge was sold in 2012 and the new owners started bundling "helpful" additional programs with project downloads.



  - The popular "Stylish" browser extension was bought by an online advertising company. Some time later it started sending the URLs of all pages users visited to their servers. There was a small user benefit for this, but the assumption is the advertising company bought the extension so they could collect this data for analytics.

  - The UK chain store Sports Direct has bought several well known sports brands with a reputation for producing good quality merchandise. They then start producing budget merchandise using the well known brand, and sell it for huge discounts. People think they are getting a bargain, because of the brand reputation.
