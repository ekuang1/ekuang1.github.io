message: <p>JJ Mahoneys is pretty close to campus and has Boddingtons and Smithwicks on tap. Other than that, we'd have to meet up in Overlake or Bellevue.<br><a href="http://www.jjmahoneys.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.jjmahoneys.com/">http://www.jjmahoneys.com/</a><br>The only other bar I know of on the eastside has turned into a biker bar, and not the kind of biker bar that is filled with guys that look like Santa Claus or Willie Nelson and have great stories to tell. The kind of bar where they compare shank scars they've gotten in prison right before someone slams a bike chain upside someones head.<br>Redmond kind of rolls up it's sidewalks early. ;)</p>
