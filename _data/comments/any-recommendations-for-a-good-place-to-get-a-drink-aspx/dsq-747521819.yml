message: <p>@Aaron I'm pretty familiar with Seattle and will probably be in Seattle most of the day hanging out with some old friends. I don't feel like crossing the bridge after I get checked into my Redmond hotel (3 blocks from MS). I won't have a car with me.<br>But do join us! Tap House sounds great.</p>
