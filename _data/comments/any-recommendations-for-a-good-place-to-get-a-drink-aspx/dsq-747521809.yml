message: <p>In Redmond itself, there aren't a lot of good bar choices, although you can get by with places like the bar at Red Robin. Additionally, you're going to be up against a culture that decides to go to bed at 9pm (seriously).<br>You might want to migrate to Bellevue (15 minutes drive from downtown Redmond). That will offer better choices. I'd recommend the Taphouse, which is open until 1am and has a HUGE beer and wine selection (not to mention will be more interesting to be in).<br><a href="http://www.taphousegrill.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.taphousegrill.com/">http://www.taphousegrill.com/</a><br>I might be able to make something later in the night (say after 8 or 9pm), depending on your schedule. Toss me an e-mail when your plans firm up.</p>
