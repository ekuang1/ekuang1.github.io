message: "<p>It's most definitely due to a combination of these three things, in order of importance:<br><br><br><br>1) Investment vs. return:  LSD requires extremely hard to acquire precursors, a long, involved synthesis process requiring advanced chemistry knowledge, and a single batch produces hundreds of thousands of doses, meaning that if you get caught, you're in for some serious jail time.<br><br><br><br>2) Scarcity (due to #1):  LSD use is down because it is hard to find.  Most LSD users have switched to mushrooms -- they have similar effects, shorter (more convenient) duration, are easier to find, and can be grown at home without any chemistry knowledge or restricted chemicals.<br><br><br><br>3) Demand:  First of all, LSD isn't addictive, so you don't have people who will do anything for a \"fix\".  Secondly, most people today don't have the time or freedom to take a day off away from everything to go tripping.  Lastly, young people today far prefer marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol -- drugs they can do without getting too much trouble from authority figures.<br><br></p>"
