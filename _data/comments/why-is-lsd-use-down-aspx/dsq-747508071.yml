message: <p>Im so mad that I wasnt born on the 60's, I love to play psychedelic with my 40 year old friends, I am 19 by the way, I love the psychedelic scence, and what I have observe is that most of the teens now are to afraid to take LSD, they are too hook-up and adicted with the media, fashion, cocaine quick fixes, they dont have patience or the will to receive new information about life, there is no life anymore, now there is what other people think of you, and material drugs, fashion and shit, that just does not make any sense to me, where is the wisdom?, stupid celebrity stuff, and more waste of time TV shit, People now waste precious time of life in lame activities just like the 50's or worst, This is why I said this has to end, and something has to be done because if this does not stop, were going into ignorance. sucks,</p>
