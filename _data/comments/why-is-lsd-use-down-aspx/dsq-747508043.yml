message: <p>The most powerful hallucinogenic drug (LSD) is still there out there... you just gotta look a little bit harder for it.  LSD, only one teaspoon would mentally incapacitate a city the size of Binghamton NY.  You can make your own really good legal mixture hallucinogenic, not comparable to LSD, but decent.  Woodrose seed, Henbane, Bell Donna, etc.  If you never tried it, I recommend it at least once in a lifetime.  One of the many best life experiences ever.  Mushrooms, Mescaline, and LSD.  Been there done that, many times... Incredible!</p>
