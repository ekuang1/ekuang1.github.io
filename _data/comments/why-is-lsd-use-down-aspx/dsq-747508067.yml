message: <p>First of all, LSD is needed right now. Our time is disected, analyzed, connected and exploited by technology, media and most of our friends and family. We are connected by cell phones, PDA's, and God knows what else.<br>Everyone, take off your cell for a few hours, disconnect and find a nice comfortable place in your living room or beautiful natural surrounding with a couple of good friends, good music, some drinks (for later) and weed and take at least 80-400+ micrograms (obviously the 400 mics for the experienced psychonauts) of LSD and enjoy the timeless voyage.<br>The reason why LSD is scarce is because the two gentlemen who produced 95% of it were busted. I'm sure I had a lot of their product back in the day (1985-1990) because it was so clean and predictable. Very nice, creative, intellectual, colorful stuff.<br>Bad and often erroneous press didn't help.<br>So, someone please make tons of it (the mean, mean world needs it)and until then remember your "Set and Setting" guidelines kiddies and take those lovely mushrooms and hold down the psychedelic fort.<br>....from your upstanding citizen, GIM<br></p>
