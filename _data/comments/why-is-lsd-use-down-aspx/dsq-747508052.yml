message: <p>LSD use is reportedly down partly due to the fact that it is virtually impossible to test and prove LSD is present in someones system after 12 hours, most other drugs can be detected for 24-48 hours. So hospitals/police can't prove you have taken it. Obviously other club druugs/hallucinogenics have become much more affordable and available as well which has had an effect.</p>
