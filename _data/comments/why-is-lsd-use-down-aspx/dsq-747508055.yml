message: <p>Demand is certainly not the problem. Sure alternatives have been found, but if lsd were to find its way back to being readily available, it would quickly find it's market again. Now and then when it does make its way into the midwest, the small amount which arrives is eaten up in a matter of days because people are so happy to see it again. Not to mention, people are willing to pay prices which would be absolutely outrageous 5 years ago. In fact, they're almost desperate to pay the prices. It will make its comeback one day when a chemist who is organized is driven enough to make it happen. Its far too easy and cheap to produce for it to be gone forever.</p>
