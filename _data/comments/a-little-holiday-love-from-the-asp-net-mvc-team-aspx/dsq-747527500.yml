message: "<p>No code behind?  Shades of classic ASP.  Sounds like more of the new old thing.<br>ASP.Net MVC does not implement MVC.  Controller injects between Model and View instead of a triad.  Controller generates HTML which makes Controller the View.  Controller should only take user actions from the View and update the Model, never the other way around.<br>It appears to me that this is a marketing change similar to Microsoft's vacillation between distributed applications to server applications, back to distributed and now back to server.  If you don't have something new to sell, you don't have anything at all to sell.  The solution: package something old and call it new.<br>I don't mind the architecture, but why call it MVC?  Is it so important to implement MVC or, for that matter, any particular pattern?  If good web design can be improved to include all of the benefits of ASP.Net MVC, just document a new design pattern, such as Separate Domain from View, or Create Separate Business and DataLayer.  If you remember that desing patterns are nothing more than elements of re-usable object oriented software, it is obvious that we do not have to use every identified pattern in every environment.  Just as I won't use my tucked-away image manipulation library in a simple console application, it may not be best to use MVC in a disconnected state application such as a web page.  Even though it does make sense to separate business logic and UI logic and to do test driven development, these benefits are available without MVC.</p>"
