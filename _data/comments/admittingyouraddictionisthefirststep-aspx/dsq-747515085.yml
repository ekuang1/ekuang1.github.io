message: <p>Hmmm... I never considered that idea.  How does an XBox 360 compare against a Dual Core 3.0 GHZ running nVidia 6800 (what I have now)?<br>The environment in Oblivion is a big draw for me, so I'd like to turn on more of the effects (shadow, lighting, distance, etc...) up higher.  Do you have a lot turned up on the XBox 360?<br>As for the $500, it's kinda a joke.  I gotta present her the sticker shock option, then slide in with the 7900 GT for <strong>only</strong> $300.<br>Of course, when my wife reads this, she'll know better.</p>
