message: <p>As to the question of how to dedicate the necessary time to Oblivion... luckily I started the game about 3 days after I took a nasty skating spill.  For at least a week I was pretty much sedentary.  A half hour in the morning before work, an hour over lunch, a couple hours at night... it's easy to blow that kind of time when you can reply to any of the wife's requests with 'But I'm hurt'.<br>So my advice to anyone starting their Oblivion quest... injur yourself.  Just be sure not to mangle the hands or fingers too badly.</p>
