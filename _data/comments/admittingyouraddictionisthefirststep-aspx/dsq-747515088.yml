message: <p>All Xbox360s games have the same graphics settings. High. Full stop. It runs at 30fps locked, AFAIK. I run at 1080i on a 40" screen and sit about 8 feet away. <br>I walked all the way to the top of the north mountain and turned around and could see about ~4km away the top of the spire of the Imperial City. Clouds were moving by. I suspect, and I have no data to support this, that the graphics on an XBox360 are very much comparable to a 6800, if not greater.<br>i believe it's a ATI Radeon R600<br>65nm <br>64 Shader pipelines (Vec4+Scalar) <br>32 TMU's <br>32 ROPs <br>128 Shader Operations per Cycle <br>900MHz Core <br>107.3 billion shader ops/sec <br>512GFLOPs for the shaders <br>2.5 Billion triangles/sec <br>27.6 Gpixels/Gtexels/sec <br>256-bit 512MB 1.8GHz GDDR4 Memory <br>59.6 GB/sec Bandwidth (at 1.8GHz) <br>WGF2.0 Unified Shader <br>But don't quote me.</p>
