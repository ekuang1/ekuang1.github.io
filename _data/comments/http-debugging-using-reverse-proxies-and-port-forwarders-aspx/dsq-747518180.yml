message: <p>Dude, the effetech http sniffer is nowhere *near* Fiddler. Have you played with Fiddler?<br>Do this, sniff some http requests. Then click on a request and click on the "Request Builder". Then drag a request from the left into the request builder, and tweak the request and then execute it.<br>How do you do that with effetech?</p>
