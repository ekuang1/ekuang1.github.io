message: <p>I just wanted to say thank you for writing about PostSharp, and to mention two improvements.Â </p><p>First, moving some logic to build time will make the aspect much faster at run time. See the fork <a href="https://github.com/gfraiteur/NullGuard" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/gfraiteur/NullGuard">https://github.com/gfraiteu...</a> for details (I sent a pull request). The code being generated by PostSharp Professional Edition will be much simpler also because it will analyze the aspect and only generate the code that supports features actually used by the aspect.</p><p>Second, PostSharp 3 CTP (which can be installed from Visual Studio Extension Manager) contains a ready-made implementation of the aspect, but in an "opt-in" version (what you did is "opt out"). Just position the caret on a parameter and the aspect will be offered as a smart tag. This is a *very* fresh feature :). This option will generate code that is almost as good as hand-written code.</p><p>-gael</p><p></p>
