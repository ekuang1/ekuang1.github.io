message: <p>i remember these null checks beign called "Precondition assertions" which were typically done in C/C++ , i think the problem is not due to "nulls" but to the fact that programmers arent friends of asserting a functions' precondition. Take an integer parameter for example, we still have the same "null" problem if we assume all input will be positive integers, or whether the default values like 0 are correct. It should be a good programming standard to ALWAYS check for parameter preconditions and save a lot of headaches in the future (such as DateTime types with SQL ranges being different)</p>
