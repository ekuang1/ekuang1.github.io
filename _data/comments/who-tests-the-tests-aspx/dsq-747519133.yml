message: <p>As I was reading along I thought you were going to bring your triangulation analogy to the point of other types of tests - possibly acceptance testing in the form of Fit(nesse). I think the code, basic unit tests, and client defined acceptance testing really form the trifecta we're aiming for.<br>Additionally, the "triangulation" principle applies to almost every field imaginable. Having recently completed some small construction jobs around the house, I well know that two points may make a straight line but it might not be the straight line you intended it to be. Especially when cutting drywall or plywood, always opt for that third point of reference!<br></p>
