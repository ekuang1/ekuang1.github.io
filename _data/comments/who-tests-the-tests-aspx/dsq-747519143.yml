message: "<p>Hi Phil,<br>Being in a situation with just half a QA on the project, a limited amount of unit-tests and limited resources I totaly get \"The Glow\" on \"lean\" and \"triangulation\".<br>Keeping in mind the goal of the sailing-trip one could argue that all sextants (unit-tests) should agree. Failure of any one of them should't distract from the main goal... just get there.<br>To identify the failing unit-test one could test the bigger picture... try navigating on stars, wind and actually seeing on-route islands should indicate which sextant is the best one.<br>One could argue that the correct test for a unit-test is the test that validates the outcome of all it's parts. This principle could then be chained on a higher level to validate the ultimate goal of the tests.<br>Still this doesn't validate the ultimate goal... While some tests may report success some sub-tests may still report results that are incorrect, however upto now there results have been sufficient to meet business-needs.<br>Conclusion: One could test a test for eternaty but only the latest insight can validate it all.</p>"
