message: <p>One possible question that can be asked of this approach is:<br>"Why not just make a more reliable sextant in the first place?"<br>In which case you see amazing things when you look at the economics of the situation.<br>Say the textant costs ten dollars to manufacture at its current level of quality.<br>To strengthen, reinforce, improve, lighten, and refine every aspect of the sextant. Yet the reliability might only double.<br>But by using two or three sextants at once -- the cost obviously goes up in a linear way. While the reliability goes up by an order of magnitude for every new sextant. <br>Say the unreliability was 1/1000 --&gt; for two sextants the unreliability is 1/1000 * 1/1000.... for three you have one in a billion.... to get these same results by improving just one sextant would be giga-normously insanely prohibitively expensive.</p>
