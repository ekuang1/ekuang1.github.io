message: "<p>Personally, I'd prefer to work on Free/Libre Software as you will automatically be an Open-Source, especially if you're using GPL, which is both camps (camps, not the devs) #1 choice for licensing.<br>And as for the term, I prefer the new modern term \"FLOSS\" for \"Free/Libre (and) Open-Source Software\", which is more interesting especially when you say \"get a FLOSS\" (lolz ambigousity again).<br>:)<br></p>"
