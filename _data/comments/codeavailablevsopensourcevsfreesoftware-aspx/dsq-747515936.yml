message: "<p>Very interesting presentation of free, open source and a 3rd category nicely named \"source available\". I'd like to add \"freeware\" as another term that's often used in this confusing mix. And \"public domain\" which by the way does not exist all over the World.<br>Reasons for mixing these terms can also emanate from cultural aspects as there's no 1:1 mapping of \"free\" in all languages and cultures. Besides, is the \"free\" in \"free software\" to be compared to \"free speech\" or \"free press\" or \"free to use as you please\" or even \"free mind\"?<br>Is what is meant with \"free software\" really \"free\"? That's the subject of an intense, almost religious debate that eventually turns out to be tightly linked to the propagation of the terms and conditions (the license) of a free/open source software product to derivative works and to other works that interact with this software. In this context the term \"copyleft\" is quintessential: it describes your rights and duties with respect to how a software developer can (re)use the software and how other software may interact with the software. One source of debate originates in how \"copyleft\" and \"freedom\" can be seen as expressions of the same idea (or not). Some see \"copyleft\" as a charter that protects the software, other see \"copyleft\" as an obstacle for freely using it.<br>The acronym \"FLOSS\", which stands for free, libre and open source software, tries to catch parts of the aforementioned categories but does not solve or address the differences between them. Personally I'm not a fan of this term as it brings more confusion by grouping movements that share common ideas but are in fact too different to correctly describe as a whole.<br>Maybe we should stop looking at the source code only and start looking at the fascinating \"FLOSS phenomenon\" through different goggles...</p>"
