message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Its been a while since this was posted and it looks like the read me has been updated and no longer has the section entitle "Changes for ASP.NET MVC Preview 2" at the link provided. Could you provide another link on how to get preview 2 up and going? For reason I wont get into, I can not just move to preview 3 or later.<br>Thanks in advance.</p>
