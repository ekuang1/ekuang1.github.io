message: <p>So, is routing final in this beta release or is it not? From the said on Scott's blog it seems it's a final version like also Entity Framework. From this here it seems like Preview 3 will change routing. So, is it usable in production or not?<br>Also is EntityFramework usable or not?<br>Thank you.</p>
