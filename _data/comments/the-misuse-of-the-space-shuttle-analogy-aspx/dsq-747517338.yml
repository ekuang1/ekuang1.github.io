message: <p>The Shuttle is a bit of a mild fascination of mine. Actually the software process is :). Here's some fun trivia:<br>The Shuttle Software is one of a handful of software apps that has been awarded the Carnegie Mellon Capability Maturity Level 5 rating. This essentially means it's just about as perfect as the human mind can make.<br>There are just over 2 million lines of code in the Avionics piece - the thing that basically "flies" the shuttle. Each line is versioned and tracked individually. Only 3 errors were found in their "release" version.<br>240 people are devoted to writing the Shuttle Software, and they work in a wing of IBM.<br>Parallel processing is heavily used with the shuttle, since the redundant systems (there are five redundant "operating systems" running in failover) need to know what the other is doing. A shuttle mission was stopped once because the fourth system wouldn't boot (Windows Advantage issues I think).<br>There are lots more where that came from and I've been meaning to put a post up about it for a while. My opinion is that the actual process simply can't be emulated - it's ridiculous. However the idea of writing such dedicated software, to me, is great. This kind of dedication is paramount to creating good software for your client and many times (I believe) people are in the habit of conforming to the trend of the day and not focusing on what their client needs. I'll stop here since I have my own blog that I can use.... :p</p>
