message: <p>I like this a lot.  I like lambdas more and more every day.  This the first time I've seen an example of a lambda with more than one line of code.  If I had seen that when I was first introduced to lambdas, I would have learned them quicker.  With one-line lambdas, there is a lot implied, and that makes the learning curve a little steeper.<br>The thing I like about using anonymous functions is that you don't have to name them!  I got this attitude from working with JavaScript.  Naming is hard, but often unnecessary.</p>
