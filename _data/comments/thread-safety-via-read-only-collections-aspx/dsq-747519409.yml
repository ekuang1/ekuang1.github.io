message: <p>However a bigger question is should we be restricting the users of our class in this way. Do we wish to empower the users of our class with the ability to change things, (e.g. "Alaska splits into 50th and 51st State in war over the list of correct names for snow") or simply lock them in.<br>I think the fact that we want to do this, is actually more revealing of our attitude to our fellow developers and their abilities, and its something I constantly battle with.
