message: <p>@Oran Ah! I see. I've <a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/04/setting-propertybehavior-on-all-properties-with-rhino-mocks.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/04/setting-propertybehavior-on-all-properties-with-rhino-mocks.aspx">written before</a> that I generally prefer state-based testing over interaction testing. Not that I don't use or like interaction based testing, just that I tend to use state-based testing more often. This might explain why I was drawn to MoQ.<br>Both Rhino Mocks and MoQ support that state-based testing.<br>So my comparison is incomplete. I used both frameworks to create Stubs or Fakes (using Fowler's hierarchy) but not Mocks. I should play around with doing interaction based testing with both to see what that looks like.</p>
