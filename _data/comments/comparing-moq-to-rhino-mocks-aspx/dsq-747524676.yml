message: <p>Just wanted to give you a heads-up that thanks to user feedback (Oren's point taken too) feedback, we'll be simplifying the MockBehavior API to just Strict and Loose (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/issues/detail?id=33)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://code.google.com/p/moq/issues/detail?id=33)">http://code.google.com/p/mo...</a>. This hopefully acknowledges that we indeed don't need the added complexity, and just those two settings suffice. We've found they do in our own projects.<br>Next version will no longer contain the documentation or intellisense for the additional (seldom used, we learned) members (they will be there just to redirect people via [Obsolete] to the appropriate replacement), and will be gone in the following version.<br>A difference I think is important is that in Moq, expectations are a different thing to verification. So you can use expectations to set return values you never verify (stub?). We have proposals to make verification even more flexible, so this seems to have been a good design decision so far...<br></p>
