message: "<p>\"This rings true to me personally because of all the open source work I do for which I don't get paid. I do it for the joy of building something useful, for the recognition of my peers, and because I enjoy the process of writing code.</p><p>Likewise, at work, the reason I work hard is I love the products I work on.\"</p><p>I've wondered about that for a while.  Short-term, I think the claim that quality work is its own motivation is true [for the intrinsically motivated].  After you've getting paid \"enough\", it's the work that keeps you happy from day to day.</p><p>But let's also stipulate that there's an infinite amount of lovable work -- not that all work is lovable, mind you, but that you can find another job with work that's as lovable.  And let's say that there are jobs with similarly good work that pay 20% more than the place you're at now.</p><p>All other things equal (get as crazy as you want: you have X friends at both the current and new job, etc), you eventually leave, right?  That, is, the statement that quality of work is more important than cash is a day-to-day consideration. You must be able to also make a different sort of longer-term, career-selfish consideration too, however -- you still jump every few years if the money is insanely better elsewhere, because there's infinite lovable work, correct?</p><p>I think we're talking about four things across two axes.  First is a \"context of immediate happiness\", your day to day, which we can set against long-term \"career growth\".  The second axis involves two types of compensation -- \"fair pay\", as you mention above in your last section, and performance based \"carrot pay\".</p><p>\"Carrot pay\" is what's being discussed in the Murayama article when they set up what companies currently believe: \"These theories basically predict that performance-based rewards increase the likelihood that the behavior will be voluntarily performed again.\"  I don't want a carrot today for my work last week. That's not sustainable, and I'll buy that it doesn't increase motivation long-term.  (I'd also bet it does increase motivation short-term for a certain character type, but that's another argument.)</p><p>I want great work all the time and at a fair wage that shows the employer respects what I'm doing -- because, ultimately, they don't have an absolute monopoly on great work.</p><p>(Course I start to wonder how much the inflated salaries are due to short-sighted companies too.  We need someone with skill X now, and our poor planning and retention mean that we're willing to overpay for the [short] two years they stay before going to the next poorly planned workforce.  That inflation from the grasshoppers (<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/36.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/36.html\">http://www.bartleby.com/17/...</a> ) makes it tough for anyone to pin down \"market rate\".)</p><p>We work because love the work, but lovable work is fungible.  Right?</p>"
