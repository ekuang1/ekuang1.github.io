message: <p>Well, to be overly fair, I do feel, "not all work is lovable, mind you, but you can find another job with work that's as lovable".  GitHub &amp; Microsoft, for instance! Let's say it's &lt; 10% of hacker jobs.  But how many hacker jobs are there?  8% of practically infinite is...  Scarce, but still practically infinite.</p><p>Could you really not find a job you love in NC? WY? AK? if you had to?  As Mulder says, it's out there.</p><p>But yep, fair enough. I glossed over how much work it is to find another likely lovable job (a TON), and the possibility that perhaps I don't know true [professional] love. "I thought I was in love a few times, but then I met [I don't know, some equivalent of the romanticized view of Fog Creek]."  I just know I don't care if it's ASP.NET MVC, Powershell scripting, Node, or 6507 assembler, there's something fun in there if you do it right -- and, as you say, with the right people.  And I've lucked into that a number of times.</p><p>I do think you're bang on about carrot pay.  What's the negative implication when you reward "over" performance?  If you pay extra for exceptional work, you're cleaving a dichotomy that necessarily now includes the identification of unexceptional work and under performance, and that's a horrible undercut to any company's culture.  I didn't want to mention sales earlier, but I think you see where I'm going.  I don't want to go all dimestore Foucaultian here, but routinely punitive surveillance creates a poor culture for creating good code.</p><p>There is no over performance.  There is only do.  Or something like that.  Solid hiring rules everything around me?</p><p>Anyhow, thanks for the post and reply.  The more good, top-tier folks we have saying these things like yourself, the closer we get decision makers to the tipping point of actually following the advice, and a culture in which we can all love to code.  ;^)</p>
