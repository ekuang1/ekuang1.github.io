message: <p>I disagree with your premise though. :)</p><p>&gt; But let's also stipulate that there's an infinite amount of lovable work</p><p>At least from my experience, very few companies provide an environment with "lovable" work. By "lovable" I mean not only are the products interesting, but the environment in which to work is healthy and great. I think that's actually a very scarce thing.</p><p>I think the open question is could "carrot pay" work in addition to market pay? If you already adjust pay to match the market, could you get even more performance via carrot pay.</p><p>Perhaps?</p><p>But at what cost? Assuming you're people are already giving their 100%, where do they get that extra performance from? Well, in many cases, they work overtime. And that might work for a short term burst of extra productivity, but in the long term, it's not sustainable. Plenty of research shows that.</p><p>Maybe the carrot helps underperformers. But underperformers should not be rewarded. They're regular compensation is the incentive to perform well. If they continue to underperform, get rid of them.</p>
