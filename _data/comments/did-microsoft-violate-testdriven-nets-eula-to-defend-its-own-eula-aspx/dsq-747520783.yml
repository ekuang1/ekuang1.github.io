message: <p>@Jamie - You also list other assemblies which are not part of the express SKUs, but which were linked to.  So I'll concede the assembly issue for sake of argument, that still doesn't address the specific absense of the registry key or the intent of the Epxress SKUs not to provide add-in functionality.  My first comment here was specifically about how high a hurdle a company must impose before we would consider it a technical limitation?  Do we have to go all the way to a DRM solution?  Do they have to obfuscate code, hide the registry entry, specifically code the app to break if someone tries some action they don't like?  No matter what the hurdle is, there is almost always some bit so code that can be written to overcome the obstacle.<br>@Scott - Given the reaction of the community, Microsoft is more likely to write this off as a failed experiment and not continue to support or provide free versions of their product.<br>@Clifton - There is no napster like site of Express add-ins because most companies have accepted the restriction - whether explicitely spelled out in the EULA or not.  If you look around at the various blogs on this topic you will see other ISVs who have stated that they refrained from this because it was considered by them to be a violation.<br>@The Other Steve - The relevance to copyright law is applicable.  Every company specifically owns the copyrights to both the binary and source forms of their software.  An EULA defines the specific rights that a company confers on a person receiving the License, whether that license is granted based on a purchase or is freely distributed.<br>@Frans - If you, as a copyright owner, choose to limit your product by supplying or not supplying registry keys, and then stipulate in your license agreement that people are not authorized to work around your limitations, then you are absolutely within your rights to do so.  Was Microsoft stupid for not making the feature more difficult to enable?  Absolutely.  Should Microsoft have been more clear in the EULA and other communications that this behavior was strictly forbidden.  Certainly.  But you cannot say that Microsoft did not make an effort to try and resolve this long before it became a legal matter.  This was not a case of Microsoft one day seeing an add-in and the next day sending out the lawyers.  Once Jaime and Microsoft came to the point where they disputed whether it was a violation or not, the only remedy to resolve the dispute was a third party.  In the US that usually involves legal action since that is the only legally binding recourse.<br>@Phil - As to your last point you are correct.  That once Jaime removed the ability of his product to work with Express then that should have been sufficient. And maybe I am missing something from the email exchange, but it appears that the feature was re-enabled in a later release of the product.</p>
