message: "<p>@Joe: I quoted the relevant portion of the lawyer's letter. I'll put it here, emphasis mine:<br></p><blockquote><br>hank you for not registering your project extender during installation and turning off your hacks by default. <strong>It appears that by setting a registry key your hacks can still be enabled</strong>. When do you plan to remove the Visual Studio express hacks, including your addin activator, from your product.</blockquote><p><br>Again, the code Jamie wrote is not a hack and does not get around any technical limitation. It's creating this registry setting that suddenly makes his plugin appear in Express. So by any reasonable interpretation, they are claiming that the registry setting <strong>is the hack</strong>.<br>I did an experiment. I installed TestDriven.NET on a Virtual PC and TD.NET didn't show up in Express. I looked at the registry settings, went in and renamed the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\8.0 key to 9.0. Restarted VS.NET Express and suddenly the TD.NET menu showed up. I need to double confirm that was all I needed to do to have TD.NET show up in Express.<br>Jamie could probably elaborate, but from my unscientific experiment, it seems that Jamie would have to explicitly test for Express in his code to disable this potential registry hack. Jamie, correct me if I'm wrong.</p>"
