message: <p>Phil, you asked...<br></p><blockquote>Being in the right is nice, but knowing when to exercise that right is a true sign of wisdom. Is this the time to exercise that right?</blockquote><p><br>The legal unpleasantness about this situation (I'm not a lawyer either but this is my understanding of general legal principle) is that companies cannot be selective about who is allowed and who is not allowed to violate end-user agreements.<br>If MSFT were to knowingly allow Jamie's plug-in to work around the limitations of their de-featured product, then MSFT would have no legal basis to go after other third-party add-ons that also violated the EULA.<br>As selective and heavy-handed as it may seem, MSFT must enforce the EULA uniformly in order to maintain any legal grounds against all other plug-in software products.<br></p>
