message: <p>@Jay - As I look through the emails, I see Microsoft repeatedly asking Jaime not to provide his add-on for the Express SKUs.  I see comments by Jaime first saying he will comply and then saying he doesn't see a violation.  Microsoft even offered additional support and assistance over and above what they normally offer to members of VSIP program.  Should they have done more?  Maybe. Could they have done more? Certainly.  But in the end, it was made crystal clear by Jaime that he would not change his position.  What choice did Microsoft have?   Allow a developer to continue to violate the MS license and undermine their product sales or take legal action.  Even the initial legal action was nothing more than a cease and desist letter.  The least onerous legal step they could take.  The legal equivelent of "Please stop doing this."  While Jaime may not have started out with the intent of violating the IP rights of Microsoft, the end result is that he was and continues to do so.  <br>@Ryan - Bringing more people to .Net is not any different than exposing more people to some radical new rock band.  Stealing songs on Napster wasn't right, and violating a companies software IP rights is also wrong.  "Hey all those Catholic priests abusing young boys is ok because they are doing so many other good things for the community."  Is that the standard we want to use?  When Microsoft does wrong we don't give them a pass just because Bill and Melinda give billions to charity.<br>So none of this answers my basic question - why are we so willing to dump on Microsoft in this case, yet are willing to overlook the willful violation of Microsoft's IP rights.  Why is Microsoft in the wrong for taking legal action to protect their property when all other efforts to work this out were ignored?  Should Microsoft have setup a meeting with BillG or SteveB instead of a lowly VP?  To me the reaction of the community on this issue is not much different than the typical MAC/Linux fanboy response I would expect to find on Slashdot.</p>
