message: "<p>This is Microsofts side of things as posted on Dan Fernandez's blog.<br>According to the post (link below) MS has removed the add-in manager from the express edition and is claiming that Jamie executes his own code specifically for the express edition that finds his assembly and loads it in the menu. Part from the MS developer team response: <br>\"He takes advantage of an extensibility point that allows user controls (such as a button class) to customize entries in the Properties window.  When his property extender gets called, he executes code that finds, loads and injects the TestDriven.Net assembly into the Express SKUâ€™s running process, thus replacing the functionality of the removed Add-In Manager.\"<br>Here is the link with the fuller story: <br><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2007/06/01/testdriven-net-and-express-technical-information.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2007/06/01/testdriven-net-and-express-technical-information.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/danie...</a></p>"
