message: <p>INTENT != REALITY<br>I intended to learn Java back in 1997 and make a bazillion dollars before everyone else got on the bandwagon.<br>I intended to buy Microsoft stock in 1994 and sell in early 2001 to make a bazillion dollars before the market crashed.<br>I intended to stop drinking before I got behind the wheel and crashed.<br>Microsoft's INTENT with the VS Express product line is irrelevant. The EULA itself states that it is the ONLY RELEVANT agreement. Almost any contract says that any promises and agreements not in writing (and included in the contract) are not valid.<br>I think it's reasonable to ask Microsoft to clearly define what parts of the agreement are being violated. The only weakness Jamie has at this point is that it <em>looks like</em> he had offered to completely remove the code and then backed away from the offer.<br>Obviously there's more behind the scenes that I am aware of...and the truth is usually somewhere in between, but I would think that it's fair to ask Microsoft to cite specific infringements rather than the "ethos" of the product or that the "intent" of the product was to not allow add-ins.<br>When we're licensing Windows or Office, any verbal promises or other documents do not matter; the EULA is all we've got. I'm not sure how statements of "intent" are applicable here.<br>It's like me saying I didn't <em>mean</em> to write that exploit.</p>
