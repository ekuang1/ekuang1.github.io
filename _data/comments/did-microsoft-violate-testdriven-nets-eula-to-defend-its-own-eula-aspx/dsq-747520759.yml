message: <p>Thanks for such a throughout analysis and giving an alternative perspective on the issue.<br>VS Express, in terms of extensibility, will never catch up to Eclipse unless MS also opens up the add-in/extensions.  I guess, the real lesson to learn is, maybe it's time MS opens up the VS API and the platform or else it will generate more buzz and erode all the good will it has just accumulated.<br></p>
