message: <p>Excellent explanation of TD.Net vs MS issue.<br>You ask a good question.  Even if MS has the right to go after Jamie, why to do so?  <br>Do they (MS) believe that by putting TD.Net in free version of VS will convince people not to buy Professional and Enterprise versions.<br>Do MS think that may be allowing Jamie to enable his add-in, will set precedence for other people to extend VS Express? <br>What really Microsoft is afraid of?</p>
