message: "<p>&gt; is that companies cannot be selective about who is <br>&gt; allowed and who is not allowed to violate end-user <br>&gt; agreements.<br>Certainly true in trademark law, but not necessarily in licensing. Companies can offer dual licensing, etc...  Also, Microsoft has leeway in choosing how strictly to interpret their license. <br>The EULA doesn't expressly forbid add-ins. If, for example, they put code in there to ignore the registry settings for add-ins, it would be crystal clear that providing an add-in would be working around a technical limitation.<br>However, the Express edition does have code to support plug-ins. Whether they *intended* for add-ins to work is irrelevant. They didn't forbid it, and thus leave room for interpretation.<br>@Joe: That would probably be an explicit violation of <a href=\"http://koders.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"koders.com\">koders.com</a> license and copyright. I'd have to look at that to be sure.<br>However, this situation is different. Suppose you download our Pro edition onto your computer and notice that with a minor tweak, you can make it search compiled assemblies as well as source files. We didn't intend for that usage, but *should&amp;* we interpret the license after-the-fact to forbid your action and go after you? I think not.<br>Also, what about my very last point? What gives Microsoft the right to violate TD.NET's EULA?<br>Jamie removed the registry setting that allows TD.NET to work with Express. Doesn't that fulfill his obligation to Microsoft? <br>At that point, to get TD.NET to work with Express requires the end user, not TD.NET, to use same method to \"workaround\" the \"technical limitation\" in Express, which would be in violation of both Microsoft's EULA as well as TD.NET's EULA.</p>"
