message: <p>@Joe:<br>You're cherry-picking again.<br>Jamie's email had a clear proviso MS failed to provide. The later email was obviously an amicable technical query.<br>The buy-out suggestion was again misinterpreted. He never suggested that. In fact, I think he might have already dismissed the idea. It was my own suggestion. Not because he violated their IP. Because he has a better product and it would serve MS well to license it even if this had not blown up. People have been saying that since the release of VS2K5.<br>Right now it just so happens to carry the bonus of turning a PR negative into a positive.<br>Your arguments _are_ straw-men. They're the very definition of straw-men. Jamie giving away his own hard work for free, has nothing to do with Catholic Preists molesting boys. There are no parallels to be drawn. You're just being ridiculous.</p>
