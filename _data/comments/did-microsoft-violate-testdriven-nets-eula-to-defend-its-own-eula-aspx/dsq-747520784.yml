message: "<p>Joe: A company can jump up and down in their EULA all they want, but if they claim that I can't work around technical limitations and that claim is stupid, I don't have to obey that clause. <br>What does that clause say actually? That if a bug ABC is in the tool, I can't work around it? uhoh. I work around several bugs in the .NET framework in my product, am I now also in violation of the eula of the <a href=\"http://vs.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"vs.net\">vs.net</a> express eula because it cleary says I can't do so?<br>Apparently. <br>If you buy a tool, ANY tool, at a store and YOU as a person want to apply that tool in any way you see fit, you find yourself legally able to so, right? Why is it then out of the question that a vendor of a given tool ABC says: \"No, you can't use our tool in combination of that other tool, that's illegal\". They can say that all they want, but that doesn't make it true: they don't have the right to tell you what to do. It's like me saying to my customers not to write a template for an nhibernate mapping file and generated code to support nhibernate. I could even put that in the EULA that they shouldn't do it, but is it legal? Should they obey that clause? <br>Of course not. MS should have disabled add-in support in the toolkit. OF course they were tool lazy to do so or technically unable to do so, so they thought they could hide behind a silly phrase in an EULA which isn't even applicable here (as the EULA has no right on what Jamie distributes to OTHERS). If Jamie compiles his code on teh command line the whole EULA argument is moot, just to illustrate the point.</p>"
