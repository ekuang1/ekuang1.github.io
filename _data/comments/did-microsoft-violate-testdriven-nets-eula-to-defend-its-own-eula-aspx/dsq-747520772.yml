message: "<p>@Sam - My interpretation is based on this email:<br>From: Jamie Cansdale<br>To: Jason Weber<br>Cc: Lorna Williamson, Ben Miller<br>Date: Jan 6, 2006 1:03 PM<br>Subject: Re: Discuss TestDrive.Net<br>Jason,<br>I am sorry I was unable to get back to you yesterday. I have given<br>more thought to the issue of TestDriven.NET's integration into the<br>Express SKU. I remain of the opinion that I'm not technically in<br>breach of the licence. However I do not want the shadow of legal<br>action hanging over me, especially as I intend to release a commercial<br>version in the Spring.<br>I have therefore decided to drop support for the Express SKU, provided<br>that we're able to draft an acceptable announcement for my users. This<br>has not been an easy decision to make as I have invested a<br>considerable amount of time into developing and testing this feature<br>(on all of the Express languages).<br>I would appreciate it if you could draft an announcement stating<br>Microsoft's position towards TestDriven.NET and its integration into<br>the various SKUs, including the fact that Microsoft doesn't consider<br>unit testing integration appropriate for the Express SKU target users.<br>I am also keen to reassure my users that Microsoft is fully<br>supportive of TestDriven.NET's future integration with VSTS.<br>Regards, Jamie.<br><br>Or also this comment from his Jan 23rd email:<br>\"The code you believe violates the Visual Studio SDK licence agreement<br>is present in all versions of TestDriven.NET (but is only actually<br>invoked when executing inside a Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition). It<br>is therefore the case that removing support for the Express SKU<br>wouldn't remedy the licence situation. Even if Microsoft chose not to<br>pursue this perceived licence breach, it would still leave any future<br>versions of TestDriven.NET in a vulnerable position.<br>I have therefore decided to remove all references to Visual Studio SDK<br>assemblies. I find this situation regrettable as it does limit<br>integration possibilities. I'm planning to discuss the issues raised<br>and find out how other add-in developers interface with the Visual<br>Studio SDK. I have seen many blog entries that seem to encourage<br>add-in developers to circumvent the PLK mechanism (assuming that is<br>what casting the DTE object to IServiceProvider does).\"<br>The arguments I made are not strawmen at all.  They are meant to highlight the fact that no matter what other redeaming qualities Jaime and his work have, it does not relieve him of the obligation to respect Microsoft's IP, just as Jaime expects others not to violate his license terms.<br>Suggesting that a company should buy you out just because you violate their IP rights is absurd.  It rewards bad behavior and sets a horrible precedent.</p>"
