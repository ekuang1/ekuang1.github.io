message: <p>@Joe:<br>"Given the reaction of the community, Microsoft is more likely to write this off as a failed experiment and not continue to support or provide free versions of their product."<br>Microsoft doesn't give away Express Editions out of the kindness of their hearts. If developers see the cost of VS.NET and SQL-Server as a barrier to entry, they'll go develop in Ruby, or PHP, or Java, or Python, etc.<br>Microsoft doesn't have the choice "to take their ball and go home".</p>
