message: "<p>This situation is just absurd.<br>@Joe:<br>It's naive to think that MS's hand was in any way \"forced\". This isn't trade-marks. It's not an issue until MS makes it an issue. You're right about one thing. At this point, MS is probably _required_ to pursue a legal resolution. There was no reason it had to get this far though.<br>MS still has another alternative. License or out-right buy  TestDriven.NET. It's in MS's own interests to do so. Not just so they can turn a bad PR situation around, but because Jamie's solution is obviously superior to their own to the people it matters to: The Developers using TDD practices.<br>What I don't get is why you're apologizing for MS, and flat-out misrepresenting the facts. You stated Jamie first agreed to remove support, but this is a rather... convenient interpretation. At several points yes, it seemed he would cave to the threats, but he maintained through-out and interest in understanding what the supposed violations actually were, and stood more firm than any of us would I'm sure in his conviction that if he wasn't in violation, he would not be simply bullied into submission.<br>That deserves respect in my opinion. Misrepresenting the situation should be beneath us.<br>The straw-man arguments about pedophiles and file-sharing should be beneath us.</p>"
