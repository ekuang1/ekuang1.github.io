message: <p>Its funny Microsoft violates TestDriven.nets EULA in order to see if <a href="http://TestDriven.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="TestDriven.net">TestDriven.net</a> still violates their EULA.<br>Not sure where this attitude that MS need to some how better disable this add-on support in Express, Its their product they get to set the terms (you don't have to accept them).  Honestly if Jamie wasn't selling his software things might be different. But he bit the hand that fed him and to MS credit they asked him not to continue doing it before sending in the lawyers.<br>Also I think one must keep in mind that we only see the email not a record of these conference calls. Who knows what was said as part of those conversations.</p>
