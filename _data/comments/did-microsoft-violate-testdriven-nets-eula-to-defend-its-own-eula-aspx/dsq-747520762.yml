message: <p>I think we can all agree, based on the information available, that Microsoft did not intend for add-ons to be created and distributed for the Express SKUs.  The documentation and lack of registry keys, which exist in the other products clearly indicates that this was Microsoft's intention.  <br>If we agree on that, then why does nobody seem to care that TDD.Net is violating the IP rights of another software company?  How hard of a technical challenge must you create in order to be able to legally defend your IP?  People hate DRM, yet if you don't go to that level of technical sophistication then you end up in this situation, where getting around the technical obstacle is trivial and therefore, in some people's reckoning, not worthy of being afforded legal protection.<br>To me, this is not much different than the thousands of people who freely traded copyrighted music on Napster.  They were clearly violating the IP rights of others but it was somehow OK because prices were too high or there were too many restrictions placed on them by the recording studios.<br>Would you be OK with TDD.Net if it was in violation of the licensing agreements for <a href="http://Koders.com?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Koders.com?">Koders.com?</a>  What if I create a website that spiders Koders and presents the information as my own?  Not much of a technical challenge, but is it right?</p>
