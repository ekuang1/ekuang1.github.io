message: <p>So if I read this right, Express is listed as not supporting add-ins, and there are modifications to it to disable the usual UI for registering add-ins. <br>Seems like an open and shut case that they dont allow add-ins in Express. Since it's their application they are perfectly justified in enabling their own extensions to it if they want without this justifying others bypassing the disabling measures.</p>
