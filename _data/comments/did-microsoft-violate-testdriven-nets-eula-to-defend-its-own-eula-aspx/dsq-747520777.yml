message: "<p>Joe:<br>If adding a single registry key is equal to violating IP we as developers are all doomed. That's the point here... <br>The strong-arm tactics from MS show that every ISV should be afraid that some day, this can happen to them as well, because they too can violate some strange EULA clause because they added a regkey or an ini file or a dll in a folder which wasn't allowed :-/<br>DRM, child abuse, mp3 sharing... they have nothing to do with adding a regkey and this case. This case also has nothing to do with copyright infrigment. It has something to do with a clause in an EULA which is irrelevant, as he uses public APIs and normal code. <br>THAT's what's important here: If using normal public APIs and stupid things like registry keys (and trust me, you have to add regkeys to make some things happen in VS.NET as an ISV, also in express, like make it find your dlls when you open the add reference dialog), can suddenly make you end up in court, demolish your good name among your peers and customers... I don't think I would like writing software in that environment anymore. <br>Software engineers should be focussing on writing software, not having to worry at every line they write if it might violate some STUPID patents or some EULA no-one knows if it's legal or not.<br>IF microsoft doesn't want any add-in in express, they could have disabled the functionality in the IDE. Jamie didn't alter any dll, he didn't alter any code, he didn't run a dongle service to work around a protection, he didn't fake serial numbers nor did he copy a copyrighted file or other material. He added a regkey. <br>Whoever it is at microsoft who started this crusade: get the hell out of my profession, you're not worth it to be in software development land. <br>Before someone thinks s/he has to bash me and tell me that copyright and copy protection and IP protection is important: YES I know that, as an ISV owner who sells software worldwide and has suffered several cases of IP theft, copyright infrigment, license purchases with stolen CC's and other crap: I definitely know what copyright and IP protection means. But don't come to me that adding a regkey is violating IP or copyright theft/infrigment! It's not violating anything. It might hurt MS' business. Though then again, this stupidity hurts them more, it will make more people re-think if they really want to be in the MS community, if they really want to invest a lot of time in a free toolkit for the ecosystem of .NET. With this out in the open, they might reconsider and invest their time into something else.<br>Way to go... MS. We really needed this community boost. :-/</p>"
