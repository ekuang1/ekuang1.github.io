message: <p>Joe,<br>I still think you missed Phil's point.  I think Phil is mainly rising above the whole dialog and is asking the more important question of should MS do this?  Not are they right?  Not did Jamie violate something...<br>The bigger question is that in my mind Jamie didn't set out to violate EULA (I think that's fairly clear).  Jamie's just wanted to make his product/freebie available to everyone.<br>I'm not a TDD guy, but those TDD guys that I know think that TDD is so essential that we should teach people TDD at the very beginning of learning to code... The Express product lines are for learning...<br>Again it's more an issue of "Should MS do this?"  In my mind they should simply ask Jamie to no longer sell a product for Express (let him continue to distribute a personal version for Express because it makes sense for a hobbyist who is learning TDD).  <br>This is of course my opinion.  But as a business owner I can tell you that being perceived in a bad light can potentially harm you especially when you are offending the people who you credit as selling your products (MS has always prided itself as a Developer's company... because Developer's create products that sell more copies of Windows and Office).<br>jk</p>
