message: <p>@Sam - I am not equating Jaime's action to those of pedophiles.  I am saying that to excuse someones illegal activity because of good works is not correct.  It was previously stated that Microsoft should have allowed Jaime to continue his actions because he brings so many people to .Net.  Even if he gives away his work for free, if that work still violates the license it is still wrong.  If his actions are wrong, they are wrong, no matter how many other good things he may do.<br>@Ryan - The technical limitation is that registry entries were specifically removed, and assemblies specifically not distributed with VS Express.  Neither of these are hard to overcome, but they were done by Micrsoft to prevent add-ins from running.</p>
