message: "<p>I still remember my first Microsoft Exam book: Que's Certification Guide for MCP for Windows Forms Applications for .NET Framework 1.1 --- And amazing thing I did at that time that I typed in ever single example and That was major breakthrough in my life of programming. The things which I did at that time were never repeated again. Now I have much much blot of experience but I still think I wouldn't be that smart if I couldn't accomplish that code typing. <br>But I agree, things are not simple windows forms now. So Thumbs up for the Nuget. That's powerful like Phil Himself.</p>"
