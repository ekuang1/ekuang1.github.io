message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I'm thinking about publishing a book, so I'm curious about why you went with Wrox vs self-publishing?  You and the other authors are already well-known (legendary, even) and I'm thinking most who will buy your book are already reading at least one of the author's blogs. If buyers don't already know you, I would think they would easily find your book on Amazon.  Is Wrox doing anything to market your book beyond what you yourself are already doing?  I'm thinking Wrox would get you into the hardcopy convenience stores like Borders (oops) or Waldenbooks (oops) or Barnes&amp;Noble (they're next), but how much will you make there compared to how much you'll make self-publishing straight to Amazon?<br>Your fan, <br>Robert</p>
