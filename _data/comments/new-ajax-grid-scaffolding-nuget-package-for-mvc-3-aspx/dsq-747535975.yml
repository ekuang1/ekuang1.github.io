message: "<p>Hi all, thanks for the comments. <br>@Scott Galloway: The plan for this grid is to build it on the <a href=\"http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/02/unleash-the-grid/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/02/unleash-the-grid/\">jQuery UI Grid</a>. However, that grid is not yet complete, so we built a simpler one to test out the interactions with the server.<br>Once that's released, we'll rebuild on that one.<br>@Kazi we can look into that. One problem today using PUT is that it doesn't work by default in some IIS configurations and not many folks realize it. So if we did that by default, you deploy your application, what worked locally might not work in your deployed server.<br>@Craig This grid just hooks into the existing Controller Scaffolder extensibility built into ASP.NET MVC's Add Controller dialog. It's really just a collection of T4 files with some glue code.<br>So anyone can take what we did, tweak the T4 files, and scaffold onto any Ajax grid implementation.<br>@Andrew We only hire the smartest interns. And the intern works with a mentor. Also, the feature team reviews the code and will take ownership of the code when the summer is over.</p>"
