message: <p>Hi,<br>I installed the package and gave it a whirl with an EF4.1 (database first) model annotated using metadata classes.  <br>The package fails reporting that it is unable to retrieve metadata for the object and that the supplied connection is not valid because it contains insufficient mapping or metadata information.<br>Suggestions?</p>
