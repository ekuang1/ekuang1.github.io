message: <p>Well in fairness you only showed part 1 of a 2 part tweet :). My main point was that people use the term "arrogant" when they don't like someone who has drive and vision - enough so to stand by it in the face of opposition. Critics use the term when they don't like what you're doing - critics of Gates/Jobs use it in the same vein.</p>
