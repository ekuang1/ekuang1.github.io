message: <p>@Rob I see your point. Sounds like your saying people tend to level the "arrogant" accusation innaccurately when they are just jealous. However, my point is that it's not *always* the case.<br>I think when people read your tweets, they thought you were saying that *all* accusations of arrogance were simply due to pettiness and envy of self confidence.<br>As I mentioned in my last comment, there's a difference between confidence and arrogance and you can tell them apart. Given that definition, would you claim Jobs is not arrogant? I've never thought of him as arrogant, but I don't know how he treats others.</p>
