message: <p>First you would have to define "success" and even "arrogance."<br>Where on the continuum from quiet self-confidence to outright arrogance do you draw the line?<br>"Success" is an even more nebulous term. If you mean somebody with a lot of money (what is "a lot"?), then a lottery winner is successful, as are many criminals. If success is winning a major sports event, then the "victors" (Cincinnati Redlegs?) over the Chicage "Black" Sox in 1919 (?) were successful.<br>For the generally accepted definition of success, and the generally accepted defintion of arrogance, you could find many "successes" who were arrogant and otherwise, and for arrogant people you could find many who were successful and otherwise.<br>Personally, I don't think it's a factor; it's a characteristic that some have, whether successful or not. It's certainly not a necessary trait.</p>
