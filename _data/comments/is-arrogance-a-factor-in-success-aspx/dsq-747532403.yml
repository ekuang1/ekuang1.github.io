message: "<p>I think one's perception of one's worth affects greatly their achievements. It makes sense that a person can do great only if they can get over their previous failures; and as success seems to be a long series of failures followed by some smashing hit, I believe arrogance certainly helps to get over the bad times. Of course, if arrogance is all that person has, it stands to reason that they will never get to to good parts either.<br>  I'll go ever further: the secret for personal happiness is an axiomatic view of one's self worth. If I think I am great, even if I may not be (I know, propostrous :D), I at least dedicate the part of the brain responsible with second guessing to other uses.</p>"
