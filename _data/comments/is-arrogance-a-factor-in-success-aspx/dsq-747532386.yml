message: <p>The problem may be more in what we as a society reward with success. Every single one of the most brilliant and talented people I've met in my life were extremely humble and all the arrogant ones were hiding something. It was in lines of work that don't receive much attention from the media though. Maybe arrogance is a factor for success in lines of work that get the media's attention.</p>
