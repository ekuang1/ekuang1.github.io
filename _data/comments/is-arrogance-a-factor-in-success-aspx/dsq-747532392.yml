message: <p>@Owen I feel lime you and others are redefining the term "arrogant". Self confidence and pride do not equal arrogant. Arrogance is marked by a sense of one's superiority and the inferiority of others. That's just not an attitude I see in the likes of Pele.<br>A person's arrogance is reflected in how they view and treat others. Self confidence is about how one sees oneself. See the difference?</p>
