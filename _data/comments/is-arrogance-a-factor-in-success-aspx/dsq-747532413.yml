message: <p>I think the premise at hand is the very fine line between arrogance and confidence. Confidence is as key in leadership as it is in PR, but the fine line is difficult to analyze at the time of action; the classification tends to be more reliable retrospectively. Arrogance is not rooted in fact, but in opinion; confidence tends to be based on concrete data. If there's a strategy or a design that's been mapped out, confidence may be necessary and at minimum tends to be very helpful in accomplishing that vision. Just the same, if the plan is lacking or looks good at the 10,000 foot view but doesn't translate well to implementation the "I'm sure it will work" attitude may be unfounded and arrogant. Ultimately it's difficult to ascertain at the moment of declaration without having been a part of the process as many of the finer details aren't meant for the public eye. In cases like this analysis of Steve Jobs it can be even more complicated by the possibility that his public statements may (an, in this case, likely are) part of that strategy. How do you market a product if your public announcements are things like "We're pretty sure it'll come out real nice" instead of "This is going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread"</p>
