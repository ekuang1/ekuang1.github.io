message: <p>Without a stated definition of what "arrogance" means, then you may as well delete this post.  We need to be a bit more scientific about our discussions, even the casual ones.  With a stated definition, you may as well just look into studies on the topic.  Asking about an "opinion" is pointless as facts are facts and "believes" change nothing.<br>Furthermore, given a definition of success being "to achieve a stated goal", if your goal is to go into a room with 100 aliens and kill 2 of them, then you enter that room and kill 3 aliens then get eaten by a group of the other aliens, that 3% kill is NOT "3% success" or "epic fail".  It's 100% success (by the above definition) with some over-achievement.  This person should be given the award for success and another for over-achievement.  The moron who sets a goal to kill 50 of them and only kills 3, will not receive any awards as he is a moron.<br>If you are calling self confidence "arrogance", then this entire discussion is pointless.  We all need self confidence.<br>If, by arrogance, you mean what we normally call (in colloquial terms) "cocky", then no, you cannot have that in success at all.  You add that, you die.  The man who stated that he could kill 50 aliens and only killed 3 is a loser (by definition; given that loser is the polar opposite of success) and should not be honored at all.  Do not confuse bravery with stupidity or confidence with arrogance.</p>
