message: <p>While I am not a big fan of Arrogance it can be a factor in success.  <br>In any creative field you must have a way to deal with negative consumer feedback. It is one way to do it. Arrogance can allow someone to create things in a vacuum of feedback.  Which means if you aren't brilliant or don't just "get" what people want/need then you are going to fail every time.  Even when you are brilliant and get it, you still fail many times.  Steve Jobs has had many failures.<br>I would argue joy is something different completely.  Joy is about creating excitement within yourself, your company, and your consumers.  <br>Joy is about motivation within all important groups (you, your org, and your consumers).  Arrogance is about removing a demotivator within you and only you.  The demotivation is loss of will do to negative feedback.<br>In conclusion, I don't think that joy and arrogance have to be mutually exclusive.  Look at the joy people have at going to the WWDC, or the joy that Steve Jobs and his people take with creating and presenting new products.  And yet Steve Jobs is still very arrogant.</p>
