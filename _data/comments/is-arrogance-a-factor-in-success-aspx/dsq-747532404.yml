message: <p>People would like to equate Steve with Apple and what Apple does but it's probably perception more than it is the whole truth. People are eager to put figureheads on corporations and then think that Apple's strategy and vision somehow flowed through a single divine entity and genius, even to the point that we start to attribute our perceptions of their personality on the company.<br>What a ridiculous idea. I am sorry but Steve did not come up with iPod nor did his perceived arrogance influence the design or the business model.<br></p>
