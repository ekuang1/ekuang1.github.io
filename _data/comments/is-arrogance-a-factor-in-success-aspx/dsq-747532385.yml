message: <p>I'd actually argue the exact opposite. Folks like Jobs and Larry Ellison are the exception that confirm the rule. The rule being that the valley of failure is full of arrogant and incompetent people.<br>Arrogance will often get in your way to success. One has to be much deeper than the simple projected image of an arrogant leader to achieve notable things.<br>I think the hardest thing is to administer your own success and the perception toward your public persona. I don't believe that a significant portion of our Industry's (or any industry even) exponents are really arrogant in nature. They just don't pay attention or don't have the skills to keep a positive demeanor.</p>
