message: "<p>Phil, I'm from Brazil and I have to agree with you about two things. First, Brazil's national team from 1970 was one of the best teams ever. Second, there's much more than arrogance in Steve Jobs.<br>If you look at him back in 1996, where he stood on stage at Macworld 97 (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHNrqPkefI\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHNrqPkefI\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHNrqPkefI</a>), he talks about creating a good strategy so that people at Apple could believe it and follow it.<br>And I personally believe that, during that fisrt four years of hard work (1997 - 2001) where Apple was recovering itself, a lot of joy, passion, and even a sense of \"major calling for a greater good\" existed back there.<br>But there were also doubts, pain, pride and other feelings that appears during long periods of hard work and no result (let's face it: four years of extra-time, few hours of sleep and pressure is a long time) can damage or even destroy your strategy.<br>So there's a need for a leader with absolute certainty about the future. People need a leader with a vision that doesn't change, specially in hard times. Sometimes it can be confused with arrogance, but it ain't.<br>Oh, one more thing. Once you brought sports as an example of success, let's use another one to show how exagerated belief in winning was confused with arrogance. Let's use Muhammad Ali (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I1bLBGxbI0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I1bLBGxbI0\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I1bLBGxbI0</a>).</p>"
