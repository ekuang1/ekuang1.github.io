message: <p>I remember writing something along the lines of the first series of this blog, The route file being watched was in a network drive though and everytime it went down, the filewatcher class would just failt to keep monitoring changes. In the end, i just felt that the extra coding and complexity introduced was not worth the benefit. Very good article.</p>
