message: <p>I cannot get the upgrade to work.  It asks me for the site admin username and password, which does not work. I performed the password reset via SQL query analyzer and it still does not work. I am confident that I know what the username and password are, but they just do not work when I attempt to perform the upgrade to 1.9.  Any suggestions?<br>Also, since I am stuck using the previous version of subtext for now, I am getting spam via my comments in older blog entries, even though comments are disabled after 5 days.  Weird.</p>
