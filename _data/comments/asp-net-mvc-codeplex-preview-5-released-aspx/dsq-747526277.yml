message: <p>I was also having a problem with Visual Studio 2008 SP1 crashing every time I tried to open a View.  I uninstalled "PowerCommands for Visual Studio 2008" and the problem has gone away.  I don't have time to investigate why this worked, but wanted to share this just in case it helps anyone else out.</p>
