message: <p>I must say, this preview 5 release is the worse I've seen so far.  Maybe because ScottGu isn't around?<br>Previously, the readme would include breaking changes, this release document barely gives any information and there is much that isn't working.  Where is the 'moving from preview 4 to preview 5 changes?'<br>I give MS a 1 out of 5 on this preview, which is too bad, prior to this it was done very well...<br>Guess I'm really surprised to see 'ReadFromRequest' gone without any mention of it at all.<br>Too bad I've used it all over the place - seems rather useful - why is it gone?</p>
