message: "<p>These are very good tips, even for small User Group meetings.  I can't number the UG demos I have seen head south. The audience is visibly and audibly lost, as the presenter tries (unsuccessfully, at times) to recover.<br><br>My own presentation safety measures include:<br>- Don't lose your cool, when things go bad.  Just concentrate of recovering fast.  (Remember that iPhone4 thing?)<br>- Relax. The audience is there to learn from you, not to judge you.  They can sense anxiety. Show them you have the mad skills, by calmly resolving issues.<br>- Don't say anything negative about the mistake -- if anything, make some sort of wisecrack (only one!).  Don't express frustration or anger.<br>- Become Julia Child -- have a finished dish already baked in advance, and in the other oven.  This way, you can simply cut/copy a hunk of code, file, assembly, or the whole darn thing.<br>- Close unneeded services on the your laptops.  Don't risk having some application bog down your presentation, because it is updating itself or spouting Twitter toasts.  (Or Scott Hanselman's phone number. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/hQYk8X\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://bit.ly/hQYk8X\">http://bit.ly/hQYk8X</a> )<br>- Carry a fresh, backup laptop HDD, when travelling.<br>- Use a good backup application on all HDDs, that allows you to fully restore the system to a new HDD.  (See Sott Hanselman's story: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gtMxQc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://bit.ly/gtMxQc\">http://bit.ly/gtMxQc</a> )<br>- Have the host machine and VMs running for no lees than 60 minutes prior to presenting.  This combats rogue services and updates, and ensures the machine is warmed up.<br>- Try out the projection system in advance.  The projectors at the Utah DNUG meeting hall are notorious for displaying everything in magenta, when too high of a resolution is used.<br>- Set the laptop external display to the native resolution of the projection system, to combat fuzzy text.<br>- Carry extra, fully-charged batteries for everything.<br>- Carry wired peripherals, in case there's too much RF interference from the audience. (Gadget geeks!)<br>- Don't drink for 40 minutes before presenting.  During presentation, don't drink a lot.  You have to make it through the presentation and Q&amp;A!<br>- Mute your mobile devices.<br>-- Don't drone on like a broken Ben Stein.  Prectice using plenty of infection in your voice.<br>- Don't babble on about irrelevant crap.<br>- Become David Copperfield -- always keep the audience attention moving, especially when that KVM stunt comes into play.<br>- Smile, and have fun.</p>"
