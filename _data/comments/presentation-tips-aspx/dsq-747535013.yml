message: <p>Great post, especially the tip about saving the parts of the internet locally that you intend to use in case everything blows up.<br>I have seen many presentations (and done some myself), where I just want to display something on a website and then, "ooh, the internet's not working right now...", and it's such a pity and ruins the flow</p>
