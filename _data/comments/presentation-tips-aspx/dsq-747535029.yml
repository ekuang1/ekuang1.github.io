message: <p>That was a great presentation! Was great meeting you at MIX. I get wary if I see a developer crank out 50 lines of mystical generic's without mistake, or magically inject and huge code snipit.<br>Tips are great though! Almost all developers will end up giving a presentation at some point if only internally to our coworkers. And tips like these help us pull off professional level presentations that in the end, help everyone learn more.</p>
