message: <p>hmm, great hand writing :) I thought my hand writing was very bad but it is nearly the same as scott's :) <br>In my opinion, your first presentation was nearly awesome. there were some broken things and you have got lots of build errors but who doesn't get them? I don't know maybe I liked it because your way of explaining things fits me. great job you did there. <br>I guess you will be on TechEd doing presentations on this May. will we be able to watch those sessions, too?</p>
