message: <p>Many of these tips are comparable to any discipline where rehearsal is involved, for example, performing arts.<br>A while ago I played in a band, and some of my band mates used to make a bit of fun about my habit of testing cables and amplifiers before the shows, carrying extra instruments and cables, and many other assorted tools. I have to say that all these preparation saved us a lot of times from disaster.<br>Maybe there's some kind of knowledge that can be shared between programmers and musicians.</p>
