message: <p>Hi Phil, great post and kudos for this, your video on C9 and your .Net rocks cast. <br>All is great, the integration rocks, but I have a bit of a problem.</p><p>If I clone a non VS solution project (like Angular or Angular Material) there is no VS .sln file or .cproj project in which case I can clone but I can't use.<br>I can force my way by opening it as a web site and then creating an sln file pointing there but seems to me it defeats the purpose.<br>What's to do in such case? How can I keep them integrated and in flow? Is even a way to do it?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
