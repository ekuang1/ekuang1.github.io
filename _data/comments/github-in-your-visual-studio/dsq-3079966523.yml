message: <p>I'm not sure what you mean. Why would Microsoft themselves have to support code review against Github pull requests? Besides, after looking at this article i searched a bit and found out that Github pull requests reviews are planned already as evidence by this post <a href="https://github.com/github/VisualStudio/issues/207#issuecomment-269032257" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/github/VisualStudio/issues/207#issuecomment-269032257">https://github.com/github/V...</a>. There are at least 3 separate issues on the official Github to track it. Am I missing something here?</p>
