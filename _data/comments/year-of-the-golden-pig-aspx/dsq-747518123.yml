message: "<p>600 years? Golden pig? Mate, I dunno where you get your info, but it's well bodgy. I won't repeat the umpteen corrections that others have given you, except to say last golden pig year was 1971.<br>Anyway, here's how to work out which element maps to which year. The last digit of the year tells you the element, like so:<br>0,1 =&gt; gold (aka metal)<br>2,3 =&gt; water<br>4,5 =&gt; wood<br>6,7 =&gt; fire<br>8,9 =&gt; earth<br>Example: Current 60-year cycle started in 1984, year of the wooden mouse. 2008 is year of the earth mouse.</p>"
