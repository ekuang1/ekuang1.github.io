message: <p>i dunno, but either way, you guys are very blessed. <br>if anyone wants a real life testimonial about feng shui, my parents are living proof. lol. we were always an average family, financially. about 6 years ago, my parents started practicing feng shui religiously and let's just say they're VERY comfortable, considering they were poor immigrants from the philippines some 35 years ago.<br>i don't practice it just YET, because i want to do more research before investing time, money and faith into it. but i think feng shui has its truths.<br></p>
