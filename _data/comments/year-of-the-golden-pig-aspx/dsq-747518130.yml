message: <p>The Fire Pig became a Golden Pig because of Emperor Wu De of the Tang, who switched Chinese currency to ingots.<br>Anyway, here's how to work out which element maps to which year. The last digit of the year tells you the element, like so:<br>0,1 =&gt; metal<br>2,3 =&gt; water<br>4,5 =&gt; wood<br>6,7 =&gt; fire (red aka golden )<br>8,9 =&gt; earth<br>Pig Element is mostly water and some wood<br>Golden Pig is like a ying yang thing ... fire and water<br>with some wood to keep the fire from burning out.<br>Pigs are lucky and loyal.</p>
