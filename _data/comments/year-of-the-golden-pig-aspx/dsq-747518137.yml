message: <p>You know, I just had a Golden Pig baby on May first and she is {I say this with modesty} perfect in all respects. I do know a golden Pig from 1971. My friend Amy. She is not "rich" persay but she has married a younger investment banker who adores her ... that counts right? Moreover, she is amazingly self-reliant and hard-working, so she has never gotten into debt. If my wee Piggy is anything like Amy I'll consider that plenty "lucky". Congrats on your fatherhood, BTW. Parenthood is wonderful and you will love it once you adjust to sleep deprivation and constant worry  :0)</p>
