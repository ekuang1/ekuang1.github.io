message: <p>Hi Jenny, <br>Thanks for the info above. It is very interesting but how do you know when is the golden year? How do you calculate the combination element to arrive at the golden year as gold doesn't seem to go in a pattern? ie. When is the next golden year?  <br>Can you provide beyond 2020? Also why does your calculation starts 4th Feb and ends 3rd Jun?</p>
