message: <p>I heard 60 and 600 being thrown around as the frequency of teh "GOlden Pig". I think 60 is the proper number because of the 5 element and 12 animal cycle (5x12=60). And I would agree with the earlier post about this being the Fire element.<br>In any case, we are expecting our own "golden pig", although my wife and I joked that we're just having a "BBQ pork" :), because in reality it's just a Fire Pig.<br>Also, too many people assume the new animal starts on Chinese New Year, but it's on the "First Day of Spring", which is always Feb 4th of the solar calendar.  Other important dates like the Winter solstice (Dong Zhi) also happens to fall the same day each year on the solar calendar.<br></p>
