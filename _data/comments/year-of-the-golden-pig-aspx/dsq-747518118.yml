message: <p>the year of the pig 2007 is a fire pig year<br>the elements of wood, fire, earth, metal and air rotate of a 12 x 5 (60 year) cycle.<br>there is an additional aspect to the year which is the <br>heaven element (which this year is gold)<br>so it is a golden fire pig year<br>(i should know, i am a metal pig and i have been waiting a long time for this year to come around)  <br>the next time i or anyone can expect to <br>be in their exact year (animal/element) is on your 1st, 60th &amp; if very lucky  12th birthday<br>it gets complicated - you also have a companion animal which is like your inner guide. this can be any of the animals in the twelve depending on a 2 hour slot in a 24 hour day that you were born.<br>hope this clears things up<br>pig year is the end of the cycle of 12 <br>therefore it is a year of celebration auguring change.<br>auspicious, good for business and generally for having a great time - not just for those born under pig but for everyone.<br>pigs are loyal, calm, trustworthy and lucky to have around.<br>the actual animal sign is wild boar. a formidable opponent to any creature, armed with sharp tusks and a <br>temper not to be trifled with. beware predators, mess with a pig and risk a mortal wound when you could attack something smaller.<br>the chinese see that the pig eats all day, sleeps all day and has no cares in the world. <br>a lucky animal indeed.<br>the reason it is 12th in line (apparently there are many traditions) but the one i like is that the<br>other animals asked the pig to justify - it said it's meat was very tasty. the other animals finding this very distasteful ordered the pig to the back of the line. probably more correct in the nature of the pig<br>is that just as buddha was about to close the race, ( the following day)  the pig casually rolled up.<br>what happened ? says buddha - i got hungry, stopped for something to eat and then fell asleep!<br>so that was that, the pig was the last animal to enter the chinese zodiac. <br><br>by<br>christos hatjoullis - a metal pig in a golden fire year. I'm liking that</p>
