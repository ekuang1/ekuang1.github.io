message: <p>I just found this in another Korean Article, about the 600 years vs. 60 years, I guess it is a matter of who you happen to be talking to.<br><br>"There are 12 animals in the Asian horoscope, and each sign comes around once every 12 years. Put together in a combination with elements such as water, fire and earth, each year is characterized to certain special meaning. Twelve different signs with five elements means you have 60 possible combinations.<br>The golden pig year — calculated through yin-and-yang theory (and called a myth by the Korea Times) — happens only every 600 years. It is said that children born in the year of the golden pig will have great fortune. And it's a huge marketing event in South Korea."<br></p>
