message: "<p>Seems it's the year of the \"Golden Fire Pig\"...<br>The first few months of '07 should be interesting: I'm married to a Chinese Singaporean; no pressure from the family to have a 'Golden Pig' baby -- just to get busy and have a baby! We'll see what we can do... and, hey, might as well strike while the fire is golden.<br>Gong Xi Fa Cai!<br>----------------------<br>\"Fire is red or yellow, and this is associated with gold; in China, for example, red is considered a lucky color, and money is traditionally given in red envelopes. Accordingly, the Year of the Fire Pig becomes the Year of the Golden Pig. This occurs only once every 60 years, and is considered a particularly auspicious time to have children. It is believed children born during a pig year will be particularly successful in acquiring material wealth. Those born during a \"golden pig\" year, doubly so.\"<br><a href=\"http://www.seoulselection.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3897&amp;sid=9bf86fdad404edd19abcd3cdf5d26e36\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.seoulselection.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3897&amp;sid=9bf86fdad404edd19abcd3cdf5d26e36\">http://www.seoulselection.c...</a><br>----------------------<br>\"According to Chinese folk customs, 2007 is the 'Year of Gold', one of the five elements, and also is the 'Year of the Pig', a sign on the Chinese zodiac. The pig is regarded as good luck for a good life. A 'Golden Pig' baby has the benefit of being born under two lucky signs.\" <br><a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-01/11/content_781352.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-01/11/content_781352.htm\">http://www.chinadaily.com.c...</a></p>"
