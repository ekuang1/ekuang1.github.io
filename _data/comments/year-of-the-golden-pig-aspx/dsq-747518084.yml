message: <p>There is no element of "Gold". The element is "Metal". "Golden" refers to the colour of the "Fire" element, which in itself is auspicious (but aren't they all). Therefore this is the year of the Fire Pig but is also known as the "red" or "Golden" Pig. However, it is still a very auspicious year. By the way, the New Year actually started on 4th February (firts day of Spring), due to the previous year being a leap year (and hence an extra month), the official celebrations started a month later. So those born on or after 4th Feb are / will be "Golden Piglets"!. Happy New Year to one and all and much health, wealth and happiness to all the little piglets.</p>
