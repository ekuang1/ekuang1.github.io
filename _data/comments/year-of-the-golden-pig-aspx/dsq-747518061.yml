message: <p>Hmmm - seeing I turn 60 this year (and if the 60 year theory is correct) I should have had a very fortunate life. I have not seen wealth yet; had bowel cancer (but did recover); my life has been stressful - but I'm not in the "looney bin" (yet) - so is that fortunate? I guess it depends if you are a pessimist or optimist? Or maybe all the good things are still to come?</p>
