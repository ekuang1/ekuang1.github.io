message: "<p>Corrections: According to several sites on the web the last year of the Golden (fire) Pig was Jan. 1947 - Feb. 1948. Not 1971. That was a Metal Pig. Lot's of places are quoting it wrong. However, it is a yin fire year and sits on water, which means a year of strife and opposing forces in the babies' lives. The good news is the Golden Pig luck is supposed to help them overcome these obstructions and come out on top. Hmmmm ... The Pigs I know have seemed to have done well in life. I am not trying to convince anyone this is true (it's mostly fun) but my Dad the Golden Pig did overcome being born in a coal mining camp of Eastern Kentucky and went to Med School and in general has landed in clover ... clover that he work his arse off for that is. So I've got my fingers crossed that my wee Piggy is as 'lucky' (i.e. smart &amp; driven) as her grandpa.</p>"
