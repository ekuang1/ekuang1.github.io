message: <p>I think that people should be allowed to believe what they wish to believe. Modern life is getting harsher as the years continue on and finding a special genuine happiness (whatever that source) shouldn't be a crime.<br>Let's face it, 99 percent of religions have parts where there seems to be just that little bit of hypocrisy and a few conflicting stories.<br>Why are there people that carry on these seemingly mindless 'stupid' beliefs? Because it's something to look forward to. I raise my eyebrow at the individual who came on here acting as if Christianity is some kind of no nonsense, one hundred percent, factual religion and fobbing the beliefs of the Chinese people - as if it were all tribal mumbo jumbo.<br>With my annoying critical adult mind I've seen conflicting parts to all religions and beliefs i've come across but I don't go out of my way to offend those people. <br>If someone tries to force their belief onto me then it's another story. I won't bite my tongue and politeness goes out the window! (haha)<br>Let's learn a nice phrase:<br>"Live and let live"!</p>
