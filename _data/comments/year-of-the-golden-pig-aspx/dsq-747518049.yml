message: <p>I think you should double check the "600 years." I have read and heard from other sources (including local Chinese--I live in Shanghai) that the Golden Pig happens every "60 years." The reason is there are 12 zodiac signs/years that rotate with the 5 elements--earth, fire, water, wood, and gold. FYI...</p>
