message: <p>I'm a water pig, but congrats to your golden pig!<br>  Tell the kid it's great being a pig, b/c when other kids make fun of his appetite, it's not really being mean, it's just emphasizing a fact.  Us pigs have good appetites, and we'll never starve to death!<br>  I'm also a June pig, and apparently, the early summer pigs are especially lucky b/c everything in the world is our food.  This translates into us never having to fear poverty and lack in our lives.  So says my zen-buddist (sp?) great aunt.  She's a smart nut and knows these things.</p>
