message: <p>The Fire Pig became a Golden Pig because of Emperor Wu De of the Tang, who switched Chinese currency to ingots (zhu). In 627 CE, the first year of the reign of Zheng Guan was known as the jin zhu (gold ingot) year. This was a Fire Pig year, and the character for pig (zhu) is a homonym for the zhu that is "ingot." Phonetics turned a gold ingot year into a golden pig year. Memories of the prosperous Tang era, and the correspondence with a new reign, an ingot and a pig, sealed the auspiciousness of the occasion.</p>
