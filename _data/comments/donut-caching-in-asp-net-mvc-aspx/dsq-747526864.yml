message: <p>Maybe to clarify, I think that this solution can be very useful and it would be great if it makes it into v1. Great work Phil :)  But as I said it only caches the view generation, which in a WebForms app makes sense because the view generation and logic &amp; data fetches is intermingled, but in a mvc app it makes less sense.</p>
