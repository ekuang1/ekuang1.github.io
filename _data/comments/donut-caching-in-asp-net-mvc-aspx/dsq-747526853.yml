message: "<p>@Ken: I agree with most of what you say. Just one addon: I often see developers not separating their BL logic and mixing it with the code (take inline coding as the best example). I feel that this approach is yet another small hack which can be helpful in a _lot_ of scenarios but I would prefer designing the program in a way that there's no need in using this feature.</p>"
