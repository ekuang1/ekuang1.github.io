message: <p>While I can't comment on whether this solves the issue, I will say this is a great response to real world feedback.  I've heard the stackoverflow team talk about this constantly and I think its amazing that you're taking steps to fix it so quickly.<br>This is a glimpse of a new, transparent Microsoft that I would like to see more of.  Great work Phil, keep it up.</p>
