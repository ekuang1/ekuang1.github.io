message: <p><br>great blog app, and looking forward to .net 2.0 implementation.<br>But, displaying the search results in a div is poor usability. <br>So the page submits, and all I see is the latest post title and no search div. I have to scroll down and find it on the right hand side. I had no idea where the results where after I submitted and also the results are very small font size and no teaser describing the context of the post.<br>I think it should just display the results and a short teaser underneath in the main display section of the site where the post text normally goes.<br>But I guess that's what open source is for - making it your own.<br></p>
