message: <p>Phil, as I am looking at this page now, every Gravatar image is broken. Squished is better than broken, so I'm not sure what happened since the earlier comments.<br>Anyway, I am running SubText 1.9 and I am very, very pleased. You guys are making great progress. (My live site is still on 1.9.0, but I have the very latest code on a test site and the improvements between 1.9.0 and the latest are so nice that I'll feel like I'm making a major upgrade when I install the new release even though I'm just upgrading from 1.9.0.)</p>
