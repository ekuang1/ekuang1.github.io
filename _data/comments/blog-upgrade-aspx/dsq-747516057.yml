message: <p>Ahh yes, you are correct. On a completely unrelated note,  I hate how gravatar squishes images. And darnit if mine didn't show up (granted I just signed up for one, so maybe they haven't approved it yet). Nice grava btw ;-).<br>You know I'm an avid CS guy, but ST is looking better and better, great work!</p>
