message: <p>K i am 18 years old. I play sports, workout almost everyday! i love activities. The thing is I was always a thick girl. Everyone said i had a nice body but I just wasnt confirmed so i dieted. I became aneroxic without knowing. Until i realized how sick ive gotten and thin and weak!!! I was frightened! I lost about 60lbs in less than 2months and was still goin down! I started to eat more! but now i have become a binge eater!!! I eat whatever i can!! anything!! I eat more than my dad and brother COMBINED!! its so bad!! ive already gain like 20 lbs and i dont like it!!! i want to stop!! I dont know what to do!! I need to control but i cant when its on my mind 24/7!!</p>
