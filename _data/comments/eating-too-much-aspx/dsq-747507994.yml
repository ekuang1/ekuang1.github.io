message: <p>I have been over weight all my life. I had a weight loss surgery and lost 130 pounds. I was finally able to buy clothing anywhere. It's been seven years now and I have gained back 45 pounds. My weight is coming back fast because all I want to do is eat. I never stopped eating. I'm so depressed. I already take medication for depression but it doesn't help. I can't stop eating. Food is the only thing I find comfort in. I have no friends because I don't want to be around people and I have bad mood swings. Food is my friend.</p>
