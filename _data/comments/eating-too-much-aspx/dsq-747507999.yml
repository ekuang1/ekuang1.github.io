message: <p>Meh, I hate all this stupid diet stuff. I wanted to lose weight, so I started restricting calories like CRAZY. Eventually, without me really knowing it, I became anorexic. I would look at the food my family was eating, and I would just wanna puke (even though it was all really healthy). I actually feared bread. I didn't wanna touch it let alone eat it. <br>Well, I realized how screwed up I was, so I worked really hard to get better. I did. But now it's like I can't stop eating! I eat, although I know I'm eating zillions of calories. And in the end, I just get depressed. Egh. I gained everything I lost, plus some.</p>
