message: <p>I have an eating problem too. I thought because its winter that i was only eating more because it was cold but i eat all day! and even tho im not hungry i still keep eating, i brought some fruit but i dont feel like eating it.. im craving junk food. I use to go to the gym 4 days a week now i dont want to do any exercise coz i have no energy. im the right weight for my height but i know wat im doing is bad for my body.. i say to myself every morning wen i wake up that im going to eat healthy and exercise, by lunch time thats gone down the drain.. i think its a bad habbit ive fallen into and i need to get myself out of. its just hard and i dont have the will power.</p>
