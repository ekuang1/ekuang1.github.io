message: <p>I too can relate to the comments above. When at home I eat all the time (feels like it). Though I don't think I'm fat, because I am short you notice it when I put weight on. I exercise 3 times a week (more often if I can), and eat mostly healthy food. <br>I use to think that it was my need for chewing, and maybe it is. I'm a bit of a figget and eating stops this. What do we consider eating too much?</p>
