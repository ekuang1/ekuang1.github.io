message: <p>I think I have an eating disorder. The problem is I can go most of the day w/o eating like having a small breakfast before work or school but at night I tend to eat a lot. I'm sometimes eating to the point where I am sick and I can't stop. This happened to me on Christmas. I'm not overweight, in fact my family says I am really thin even though I think I'm about average. I just hate eating like this though.</p>
