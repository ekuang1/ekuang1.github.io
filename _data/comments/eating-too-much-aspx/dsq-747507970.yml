message: <p>OK well i was always a think girl, then last year i began a regular diet. Just  eating regular meals, then i went to only sandwiches and Special K cereal. Well i lost alot of weight TOO fast!! alot!! like 60lbs in a month! well i continued to lose when i reentered school even though I tried to add more food. Well I had become aneroxic without knowing. My parents got me out of it, but after that i became now a massive eater!! i eat so much! and ive gained already but i want to stop!! but i cant stop eating!!! i cant even get it out of my mind, i play soccer and exercise at home but still too much food it doesnt balance out so i gain!! I dont know what to do!</p>
