message: <p>im 17... and i think ive got a problem. ive never posted anything up like this before, admitting that i think i have a prolem. it feels like those people at AA meeting, but instead, im saying 'Hi im Charlie and i eat too much". (A girl Charlie btw.)<br>right, i just graduated high school, but i found that i was gaining weight right before i finished school, right when i was studying for my exams. cuz we were given free time in those weeks, we could study at home and study, we didn have to be in school, and i think that kind of triggered this problem. i stayed home too much and i guess i had nothing else to do so i ate. and that kinda made me eat more, its wierd cuz ive never been like this before, sure i always was the kinda chubby kid between all my friends, but im not overweight, i just have a few extra pounds im not comfortable with. its quite misrable cuz all my friends and skinny and have these small bodies but im tall and kinda bigger.<br>i think that breaking up with my boyfriend of almost 2 years kinda got me down, after him i kinda was seeing other people but they just made me more down and depressed cuz it felt like they could never be like my x. we broke up cuz of distance though so yea..<br>aah, i dont know, im starting to do more exercise, i jump rope and use barbells. but thats about it, i cant go for walks that often, i can only do them at the beach cuz i dont live anywhere with parks, etc. to run in. <br>also, i want to sign up for some activities like for instance kick boxing or something but im too shy cuz ill be the only chubby one between everyone and that doesnt feel too good. <br>i guess im just writing this to let my feelings out i guess. i must seem very useless. i kinda feel useless. <br>but anyways, just wanted someone to listen. if you did, then thank you.<br>C</p>
