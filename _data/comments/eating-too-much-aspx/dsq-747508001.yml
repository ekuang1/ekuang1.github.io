message: "<p>Im nearly 21 years old, 9 and a half stone and a size 10-12!<br>you're probably thinking what she gotta worry about, but thats my problem - i look in the mirror and think on a whole i look okay so why bother trying to exercise and be healthy, although i know i should, ill admit i do NO exercise and eat A WHOLE LOT of junk food without bothering<br>Today i worked out i have had MORE THAN HALF  my r.d.a (1130 cals)on PURE junk food (that i did not even enjoy) along with 3 healthy meals- i feel like i cant control what i am eating. I have no will power and as a result i feel tired, grumpy and light headed!! I want to help myself but i find the internet is useless - i know what it will tell me: exercise more, eat more fruit, dont buy any junk food and keep a diary etc... but if it were that easy there would not be a problem.. I have decided to air my problem online - its as close as i will prob come to admitting to anyone how much i can eat in a day &amp; until it eventually shows on me i prob think i wont be bothered doing anything about it, but i dont want it to become too late<br>Thanks for listening, sorry for the crap i talk. Take Care X</p>"
