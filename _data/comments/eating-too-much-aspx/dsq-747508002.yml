message: <p>I am 36 years old.  When I was 28, I weighed 398 pounds, luckily I am 5 feet 11 inches tall.  I ate for comfort -- I ate when I was stressed, happy, sad, down, depressed, celebrating -- you name it I ate it!  Well, at that time, I also had an 8 year old daughter.  I had a fork in the road of CHOOSING to live or die -- notice I had a choice to make.  <br>I now weigh 175 pounds and am in a size 8-10.  I used to wear 26/28 pants from Lane Bryant and 30/32 blouses.   I did it on my own by watching my fat grams and ate only tuna, chicke, veges, fruit and salads.  No high calorie dressing, no sweets, etc.  It took me about 1 year to lose it all and I do not have issues with a lot of loose skin because I did basic exercises toward the end of the weight loss.  You CAN transform your body by eating better -- the hardest part is truly STARTING.  Once you begin and you see weight dropping off and sizes going down (and believe me, the more you have to lose, the faster it comes off initially) you will not want to go back to binge eating and you will find other activities you will do to take the place of the long walk to the fridge.  Pray about it and just do it!  It can happen.</p>
