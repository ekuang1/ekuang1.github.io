message: <p>Ahh, ok, here's the deal. I consider myself to eat a lot. I really do. But the thing is I can, because I exercise every day except Sunday. If you do extremely strenuous and exhausting exercise all the time, you can eat! Also, building muscle helps because muscles "eat" the calories.</p>
