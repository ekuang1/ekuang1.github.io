message: <p>have you seen hannah lately , she's put on some pounds, does anyone recognise this media saying even when it only represents a star getting her cheeks back. this idealisation of being fat or skinny is only because of the media. i mean please, they say models are to skinny, and then when a model puts on some weight they call her fat. would someone please explain this to me. i admit i have a problem, i want to eat all the time bt i excercise. but i wonder, whats gunna happen the day I break a leg, how will i keep the weight off. as far as i see it, we have to choose between excercise, anorexia or bulimia if we want to loose weight without spending thousands of dollars on surgery, and looking at the choices, i am not liking the options.</p>
