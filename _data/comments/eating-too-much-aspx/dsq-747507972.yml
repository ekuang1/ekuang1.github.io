message: <p>Hey Everyone....I have been reading these post and I just want to say a couple of things. I too am overweight but I am SO tired of putting that Label on myself...This weight does not define who I am....God does and he made us to be in his image...now There is a scripture that says " As a man thinks, so is he" Doesn't that tell you something. This is all mental... It really is that simple...Lets all start being more positive and believe and visioning that the weight is off...and I believe that it will come off....we will still have to work at it but if we are positive then the cravings the temptations the worries and struggles that we deal will be easier to handle because our attitudes have been transformed..God says to speak those things that are not as though they are!! Start saying good things about your body...me personally I look great naked!!! lol I already feel better...God's word says be transformed by the renewing of your MIND!! SO That means start being positive and thinking a different way...Blessing to all and We will lose weight and be free from the bondage of being overweight and what this society says is beautiful in Jesus name amen &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>
