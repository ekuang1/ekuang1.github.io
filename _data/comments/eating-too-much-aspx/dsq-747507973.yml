message: <p>there is such a thing as food addiction, well addiction period.<br>women tend to have this problem,not only because we were designed to consume more food to maintain a higher body fat than men for reproduction but also because our culture in the west teraches women to suppress feelings especially those of anger. Ever heard a mother say to daughter "It's not lady like to be angry" or "God don't like ugly" whenver a female expresses anger. meanwhile men are praised for expressing they're aggression. So a lot of us including myself shove the emotions down our throats with food so that we don't offend anyone. now isn't that *(&amp;! up.</p>
