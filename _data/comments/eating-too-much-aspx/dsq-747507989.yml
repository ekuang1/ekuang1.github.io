message: <p>The idea is to wrap your head around the thought of losing weight...start off by keeping a diary of everything you eat (RDI is 2000 calories per day - 420Kjl = 100 cal) and all the exercises in each day that you do (I did this for 2months and now have ALOT of Will Power/Determination to go alone without diary)<br>Your goal in beginning should be to do at least 1hr exercise most days of the week (say 4,5) and the exercises you choose can be anything. I myself chose 45mins of dumbbell workouts and 25mins run everyday.<br>I went from 110kg to 69kg (BMI of 20.6) in 6months of this :) bloody happy with myself I can tell you this much.<br>Now days (basically to stay fit) I just do Dumbbell Workouts every Mon,Wed,Fri and run 3.5km in 18mins every Tue,Thur. I give myself weekends as rest, my treat for hard work.<br><br>I'm a pretty independent person...we have a tendency to be quite strong in the mind...I'm sure the rest of you can do it...contact me on my myspace if you'd like me to give you support, I know it can be hard but once you set your mind you can do ANYTHING.<br><br>P.S love how people are shocked when they see me how I've changed...certainly showed them ;)</p>
