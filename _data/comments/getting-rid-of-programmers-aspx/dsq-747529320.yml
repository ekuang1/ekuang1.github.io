message: <p>I work for a company that makes one of those frameworks, a program that should allow Bank Business Analysts to create credit acquisition flows, designing the flow of activities, designing the user Forms, connecting to external data sources, and so on.<br>The truth is that big companies, like Banks, go totally NUTS when your salesperson goes there shouting "yesterday you needed analysts AND programmers, but from now on, with my program, you will only need analysts". The customer really goes in frenzy mode, sometimes acquiring your software even without getting a deep demo!<br>Eventually, the customer realizes what common sense would always say:<br>- Business analysts are good at designing activity flows<br>- Designing complex user Forms requires some usability and technical knowledge, which the average business analyst does not have<br>- Connecting to ancient systems, calling web services and manipulating data... well, that actually requires the technical dude :-)</p>
