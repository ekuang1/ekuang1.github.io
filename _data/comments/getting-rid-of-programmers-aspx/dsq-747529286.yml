message: "<p>Interesting post - I see this sentiment quite a bit, and it makes me wonder: do other engineers have to cope with the same thing?  I mean, are there city planners out there who really want to do civil engineering themselves?  Are there car designers who want to usurp the role of the mechanical engineer?<br>From my limited experience, the answer is no.  I've worked with optical engineers - no they were not revered as gods or shunned as unwashed nerds, but they were respected and trusted as a valued part of the business plan.  I've also worked with civil engineers who seemed to be held to the same measure.  <br>So what exactly is it about *software* engineering that promotes the attitude you describe?  <br>Software engineering is unique in the respect that change plays such a huge role.  Not just requirements change, I mean environmental change.  E.g., the civil engineer doesn't have to worry about the gravitational constant changing, right?  But the software engineer does have to cope with dynamic fundamentals, such as OS behavior, an impossible-to-comprehend matrix of hardware configurations, etc.  <br>Moreover, one can become a software engineer though experience alone, with absolutely no formal training or certification.  I've done it, I've seen it - swing a dead cat at an MSDN event or user group and chances are you'll hit someone with a psychology degree.  This is not possible for most other types of engineering.  \"Well, no, I haven't designed a steel building frame, but I have built a few treehouses in my spare time.  They're probably similar enough, so let's get started...\"<br>I often wonder if these two things - the uniqueness of software engineering and the absence of any required formal education - contribute to the attitudes you describe in this post.<br>Or maybe software guys are just jerks.</p>"
