message: <p>Coming to the conversation fairly late, but still going to throw two cents in.<br>@Sherman comes closest to the point I would try to make. You can't get rid of the Programmer any more than you can get rid of the floor. Cover the dirt with cement, cover that with plywood, cover that with carpet... No matter how hard you try, you'll still be standing on something you call the floor.<br>What I mean by that is the job of the Programmer has been eliminated several times as the state of the art has advanced, yet you'll always have the role. Programmers are the people who can cross the final step of getting an idea into the machine.<br>So I agree with the conclusion - it's best to improve communication between the last hop (the dev) and the rest of the humans. Trying to skip the last hop to the machine isn't possible, because the second-to-last hop would simply become the last hop on the next generation toolset.<br></p>
