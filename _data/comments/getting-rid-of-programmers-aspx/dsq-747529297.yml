message: <p>What baffles me most is that the programmers I work with who are in the mediocre to poor skill levels and yet have significant years of experience all seem to want to be replaced by software.  We regularly go round about round about whether this or that designer will allow the business to make their own software without us.  It never works, the software is always slow and buggy and never very useful.  What I want to know is, why would someone WANT to replace themself with a bit of software that does their job less well?  Is there no pride?  Building elegant, effective software is a joy.  Communication is an integral part of the "effective" requirement.  Skill, training and aptitude are integral to the "elegant" requirement.</p>
