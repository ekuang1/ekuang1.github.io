message: '<p>@Horus Kol:  And we also need to get paid for every moment worked, like other professionals (lawyers, doctors, engineers, plumbers, electricians, etc).  We are treated like artists and expected to paint them a Rembrant for nothing so they can hang it in their lobby and use it to attract people(customers) with it.  Sorry.  Unless we ALL start charging for our work and stop giving away our hard work - we will never be respected by anyone.     I for one wouldnt mind seeing programmers unionize.   No more unpaid overtime.  No more robots doing our work (as some suggest might/will happen, or has happened in some areas already!) and no more changing of requirements 1/2 way through the project with that all too-known demand (this change can not affect the delivery date).  Yea.  Right.<br>Want to be respected, start acting like the other professionals that wont do work for us - for free!!!   I dont blame them, I blame "us".</p>'
