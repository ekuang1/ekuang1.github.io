message: "<blockquote><br>So what exactly is it about *software* engineering that promotes the attitude you describe?<br></blockquote><p><br>As a corollary to your comments above, I'd like to add that part of the problem is the underestimation of difficulty by stakeholders on what it takes to create software. I mean really, all the coders do is type, anyone can type, we all learned it in junior high for heaven's sake.<br>When you look at a civil engineering project, say a bridge, you end up with a massive structure. But no matter how sophisticated a piece of software is, the user sees the same thing: a window on a monitor. So there is a disconnect between level of effort and perceived result. All of which combines to form an opinion on the part of our stakeholders that software engineering is far easier than it actually is.<br>This leads to a defensive attitude on the part of software engineers. Back when I was younger and a much bigger asshole than I am now, my typical response to a marketing or project mangers types assertion that the current project was \"easy\" was to offer them my keyboard and to call me when they were done. I have much gentler ways of communicating the same idea these days.</p>"
