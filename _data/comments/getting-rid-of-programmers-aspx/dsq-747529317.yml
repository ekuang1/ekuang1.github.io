message: <p>What a looooong story to tell haan!<br>I think such stories are not morethank just talks leading further talks.<br>Programmers have lot to do in the future. If a team is not productive to the level then it should be analysed more in a context rather than making such statement for all 'X'. Remember we are talking baout human and every human by Nature is unique.</p>
