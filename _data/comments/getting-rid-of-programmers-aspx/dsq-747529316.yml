message: "<p>I think Andrew Steele hit the nail on the head with his quote from wikipedia. It has long been my belief that the biggest difference between software engineering and other engineering disciplines is that it is still so young, and yet so incredibly vital. The computer age snuck up on the world so quickly, that governments and corporations and anyone trying to get anything done in the modern world have had to throw any willing warm body they could find at the problem just to keep up. Its shocking when you stop and think about it, but the internet is only about 20 years old, and has only really been in wide-spread public use for about 14 years or so. That has left us with a glut of under-educated, under-experienced, under-motivated developers trying to keep the software infrastructure of the world in place with duct tape, while the foundations of that infrastructure are constantly shifting underneath them.<br>Unlike the vast majority of other scientific and mathematical disciplines - where the benefits and perils are fairly well known, because we have had time to discover them - we are still blazing the trail of \"best practices\" and even the basic theories of man/machine interaction. We are still trying to figure out what we want from computers and, therefore, from computer programmers. Its no surprise then that outsiders have a hard time seeing our value, even if they still believe that we are necessary. We simply don't have enough experience as an industry or a discipline to be able to truly articulate or demonstrate our own worth.<br>Add to that the still-staggeringly-high software project failure rate (duct tape doesn't scale well), and its no wonder that business types are jumping at the chance to replace programmers with something more \"reliable\", something that can be more easily quantified. We can shake our heads in dismay all we want, we can warn them that it won't work, but we won't be able to convince them until we can show them in no uncertain terms that we have a better way. So far we, as an industry, haven't been able to do that. Unfortunately, the biggest obstacle standing in the way of that goal is time: time to grow, time to mature, time to learn. In the meantime, I am afraid we will have to continue to grimace and suffer through misguided attempts to find the silver bullet.</p>"
