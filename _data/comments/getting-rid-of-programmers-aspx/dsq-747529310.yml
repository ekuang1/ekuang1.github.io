message: <p>@configurator, David made a good point. Maybe it's not making ourselves "better" developers that will solve this (though I don't see why we wouldn't continue to try bettering ourselves anyways), but becoming better at conveying the value of what we do.<br>That's something I learned a while back as a consultant was finding ways to convey value by having the people we were pitching define in their own words how much money the project would either save them, or make them. When they were the ones producing the back of the napkin estimates, that usually helped sell the project.<br>It's amazing that many of these guys would come into a meeting not having thought of how much it's worth. Then you ask them to estimate and they're eyes bulge open. "Wow, this will save us $10 million a year!".</p>
