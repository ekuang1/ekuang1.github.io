message: <p>As some have mentioned, a bit of the 'challenge' in dealing with customers (as coders/designers/architects) is conveying value.  We have a stigma within our organization (public education) that no one is an expert unless they are a) from the outside or b) carry a briefcase and wear a suit (jokingly). <br>Unfortunately, as I nor others in our department have "educational" degrees, we're considered lucky we can tie our own shoes.  To not have a teaching degree (even though most of us have post graduate degrees in other areas) is considered blasphemy--how could we possibly understand "education" without an education degree?<br>We can tell customers the sky is blue and be laughed at, but once an 'expert' from outside tells them it's yellow, they're all aboard.  Most of our customers agree they're not 'against' us, but that's simply "how things work" since we're an educational organization.  I have my doubts with this, but with most companies the culture is king.<br>Our group, specifically, has gained a bit of ground in the past year.  With the cuts in educational budgets, our primary focus is working with educators (classroom/central office) and focusing on process improvement (mostly through migrating paper and pencil processes to electronic systems).  At that point, they can quantify the 'value' of the endeavor (savings on paper, transmission time, ease of access, etc) and we programmers again have tangible value.<br>It's not great, but it's a start and it's working to enhance the image of information workers within the culture.</p>
