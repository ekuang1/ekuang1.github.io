message: <p>I think the only real answer is to do what other engineering disciplines have been doing for a long time - setup professional bodies which promote best practice, develop professional certification, and then keep promoting the certification.<br>Civil engineers are respected because they have to be registered with some professional body, and the requirements for that registration are minimum educations and continuing professional development. At least, that is now - used to be that anyone could put up a house/bridge/cathedral (Isambard K. Brunel wasn't what we'd think of as a civil or nautical engineer - but he built bridges and ships and a whole railway network).<br>My point is - if we want to break software engineering out of its 'bedroom amateur' public perception, we need to get ourselves organised into a properly self-regulated and outwardly respected profession - but the respect won't come until we get the regulation.</p>
