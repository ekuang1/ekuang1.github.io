message: <p>A couple of years ago I started a new job at an engineering firm that was just getting their feet wet with developing custom GIS systems.  For about a month I was trying to fit in, a programmer in a world of P.E.s and EITs and project managers, trying to find some way to describe how what I did was different from what they did.  When I hit my 90 day mark I got reviewed by my boss, his boss, and one of the engineering managers.  The engineering manager simply didn't seem to get why I was still working there and since he'd hardly ever interacted with me before, he was very vocal about how I wasn't "a contributing member of the team."<br>The following quote is my sig on CodeProject, and it's a small excerpt of what I told him in response:<br></p><blockquote>Imagine that you are hired to build a bridge over a river which gets slightly wider every day; sometimes it shrinks but nobody can predict when. Your client provides no concrete or steel, only timber and cut stone (but they won't tell you what kind). The coefficient of gravity changes randomly from hour to hour, as does the viscosity of air. Your only tools are a hacksaw, a chainsaw, a rubber mallet, and a length of rope.<br>Welcome to my world.</blockquote>
