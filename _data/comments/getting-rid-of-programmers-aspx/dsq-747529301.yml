message: <p>Your post put me in mind of the rise of the machines and the fall of mankind (or programmer kind).<br>So we develop A.I. software that can write programs, perform business analysis and write specs.  Now we programmers are redundant.  In even less time the business men (the suits) would be replaced.  After all we (programmers) have already figured out the true worth of the suits, the machines will have them and the bankers in the shredder in no time.<br>The problem we now have, until we write such A.I. software, is watching for terminators returning from the future.<br>We programmers need to keep to luddite code.<br></p>
