message: <blockquote>@Ben Taylor great point. We can't control the behavior of others, but we can control ourselves and make ourselves better.</blockquote><p><br>We can make ourselves better. The problem is that we, the ones reading these very words, are never the problem. If we didn't want to make ourselves better, we wouldn't be reading this. The problem is none of us can control the rest of the so-called software engineers.</p>
