message: <p>One follow-on to my comments above. Usually the Mechanical and Electrical engineers worked pretty well together. They usually broke up the software to various engineers, so what you got was “not my job”, I am waiting on so and so to finish. As I mention above, this BS worked for awhile, not anymore. The problem as I see it was the Software engineers were in their own world, they didn’t look at the whole project just their little piece. Just my observations, spent 35 years in this environment. The world has changed, Software can’t BS management anymore, at least at the company I work for.</p>
