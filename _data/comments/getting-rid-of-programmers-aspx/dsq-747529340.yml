message: <p>@Horus Kol<br>"...used to be that anyone could put up a house/bridge/cathedral..."<br>"Civil engineers are respected because they have to be registered with some professional body..."<br>I think this is an important point. Why do you think the requirements for civil engineers changed? Do you think it was because the civil engineers all said "We need to start taking pride in our work and differentiating the real engineers from the Morts"? Not even close. What actually happened is that people were maimed and killed and property was destroyed from buildings falling down, and local governments finally said "You are not ALLOWED to build a building unless you are certified." This *desperately* needs to happen in the software industry. Software developers need to be held accountable when their products fail to live up to specification. Lawsuits only help after the damage has already been done, and it's rare for a successful lawsuit to be brought against a developer for anything less than massive loss of life. The qualifications have to be demanded *before* the job starts; there is no other way to enforce the kind of standards that we have to employ if our discipline is ever going to be taken seriously.</p>
