message: <p>Interesting discussion,<br>Back in the day, the projects I worked on, started with Mechanical Engineering, then it was turned over to Electrical Engineering (my job), then to Software. The projects were always behind schedule, but Mechanical Engineering was usually blamed because they always had something that didn’t work right. These were not trivial projects, major surface mount pick and place machines costing major bucks. So while they were fixing the hardware, Electrical  and Software could fix their bugs. Now software is in the cross hairs, Mechanical and Electrical is done waiting on Software. The problem is management can see Mechanical and Electrical hardware, can’t see software. They put up with Software BS for awhile, now they are getting hammered, party over. I am talking major hammering. Haven’t been in that rat race for a year, suspect it is still the same.<br></p>
