message: "<p>I would rather compare software engineering with linguistics (language engineering). Everyone thinks they can whip up their own flavor of the language (English, French or Igbo). And journalists think they can do all the linguistics themselves. <br>High school kids who can build websites are also called computer gurus. <br>I don't think there is much we can do about it except wait till the bridge collapses and they call us in. Then, they'll learn from pain that they needed us in the first place. The more traditional way is to get lobbyists and politicians to make some law that ensures that an important .NET application, for instance, must be certified by a .NET Expert who in turn must be certified by a body.<br>That's how it works elsewhere: medicine, civil engineering, pharmacy, etc. Without those laws, everyone will try to play doctor when they see the sick.</p>"
