message: <p>I believe that most of us (programmers) have seen our usefulness potentially evaporate over time, if not for the constant acquisition of new knowledge. We are always learning and changing. I once read that the U.S. patent office actually closed down for a brief time, the justification being that so much had been invented, there was no need for further patents. We are not in a static business like buggy whip making. We are in a fluid business, with unlimited applications (no pun intended). The reason we do our jobs, I would hope, is the satisfaction we get when a few small flashes of brilliance and a lot of effort enable us and our organizations to "go where no man has gone before." As long as people thirst for new products, services, or better ways of doing things, the talent we provide will be indispensable.<br>Programmers bring value to organizations because they represent a form of genius that helps others express their dreams. <br></p>
