message: <p>@Ben Taylor great point. We can't control the behavior of others, but we can control ourselves and make ourselves better. Given the software project failure rate, it is kind of no wonder that some biz types feel this way.<br>Of course, I sort of feel the same when I look at how the so called biz types have run our financial system to the ground in the past year ;) Maybe we can replace Quants with software. ;) I digress.<br>The important take away is to look at what we can do to make the profession of software development more mature and better. Part of that is educating others without derision and scorn. :)</p>
