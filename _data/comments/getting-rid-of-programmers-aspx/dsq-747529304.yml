message: "<p>I definitely understand this sentiment, but if anything it reminded me of a \"guru\" at my old job. He couldn't program to save his life, but somehow talked his way up. He ended up surrounded by people of similar skill level, but they produced very visible results. Sure, they're then debugging live projects for months, but all the managers ever remembered is that the thing went live.<br>Maybe that has something to do with it: there are enough terrible programmers out there who have been easily replaced that these managers have just overgeneralized the \"rule\".</p>"
