message: <p>"Why are these business types so eager to get rid of us programmers?"<br>Because we cost a lot and many of the projects we work on completely fail or deliver little/less over what was in place previously.<br>While, many of us strive to improve our skills and work hard towards providing business value, many do not.  This (majority?) often do more harm than good on a project, but unfortunately the people that hire and fire find it hard to differentiate ("He has WCF, BizTalk &amp; MCSD on his resume?  Cool.  Hire him.")<br>IMO we are still an immature profession but we get away with it via a cloak of technical obfuscation i.e. our bosses have no idea what we are talking about.</p>
