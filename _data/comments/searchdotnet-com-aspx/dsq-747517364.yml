message: <p>It's great that you and others have created custom search engines. I'm sure I will use them, but my favorite feature is that each custom search home page displays some (if not all) of the included sites.  This way one can quickly see which .NET blogs are worth reading which is a great contribution to the community, in my opinion.  <a href="http://johnnycoder.com/blog/2006/10/26/backdoor-into-google/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://johnnycoder.com/blog/2006/10/26/backdoor-into-google/">more</a></p>
