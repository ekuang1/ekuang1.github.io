message: <p>@Engtech, I had an idea. We should build <a href="http://Fritter.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Fritter.com">Fritter.com</a> and make it bare-bones and absolutely scalable. Keep it under the radar until both Twitter and Jaiku fail under their own wait. And then unleash it on the world!</p>
