message: <p>It's a moot point. Jaiku allows you to add RSS feeds to your Jaiku stream. So you can just add your "Me with friends" feed to your Jaiku stream and use Jaiku if you want to. The only thing is you won't be able to "respond" to your Twitter friends unless you write an application that uses the Twitter API. So really, we're back to the pre-Trillian/Gaim/you-got-your-Yahoo-in-my-MSN-Messenger world where you need multiple IM accounts just to contact all of your friends. My wife is on Yahoo, my best friend is on MSN (and refuses to upgrade MSN Messenger). Now I'll have 1/2 my friends on Twitter and 1/2 on Jaiku.<br>So add your Twitter stream to Jaiku and see if using Twitter as a "global IM" is really what it's about.<br>I added my Tumblr blog to my Jaiku stream ( <a href="http://lazycoder.jaiku.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://lazycoder.jaiku.com/">http://lazycoder.jaiku.com/</a> ), which captures my   Twitter stream as well as my Yahoo favorites, Google Reader shared items, and blog posts. It's a global Lazycoder aggregate! It's a UNION ALL for my online life.<br></p>
