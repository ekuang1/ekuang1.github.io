message: "<p><strong>@Dmitry</strong>: Absolutely... we love free help!<br>But seriously, we are always open to contributions from the community. And I'm sure that Phil will be happy to get some relief when it comes to some of the front-end type stuff that you mentioned. <br>A good way to start would be submitting patches for any bugs (reported or not) that you can fix. Maybe try <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1545724&amp;group_id=137896&amp;atid=739979\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1545724&amp;group_id=137896&amp;atid=739979\">this one</a> on for size.<br>I know that we had planed a major overhaul of the skinning architecture for Subtext 2.0 or 2.1 - but I'm not sure how on-track that is right now. At any rate, any help you can offer is more than welcome.<br>Thanks.</p>"
