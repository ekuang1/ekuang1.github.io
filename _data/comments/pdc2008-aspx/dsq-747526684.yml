message: <p>Hey Phil,<br>Were you one of the few good drummers at the Dev After Dark party?  You remind me of one of the guys who was really good.  I was drumming there a bit (rusty, but competent).  <br>Ran into your blog while trying to find where all the pro video and photos that were shot at that party ended up.  Any ideas?<br>Eric</p>
