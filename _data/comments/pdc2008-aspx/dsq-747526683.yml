message: <p>@Jason that's Jeff Atwood's laptop in that pic. :)<br>@Boersnoes Ha! Good advice. I noticed it too when I watched the video. When you're up there, you don't think about the camera. I thought the camera would pan out far enough that it wouldn't matter. But they were really up close. ;)<br>Next time I'll stay more still, and ask them to invest in a steady cam. ;)<br>@Claudio Yeah man, you rocked the drums!</p>
