message: <p>Hello I have made my Flickr badge almost valid XHTML but there is still one more problem I have with it and that is "document type does not allow element 'script' here.". what did you mean when you saud `by placing the script within a caption element.`? How do you do this?<br>My Flickr badge markup is located <a href="http://trm96.com/upload/flickr_badge.txt" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://trm96.com/upload/flickr_badge.txt">here</a></p>
