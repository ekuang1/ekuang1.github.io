message: <p>@ AsbjornM:<br>This is new because we haven't had same service so far.<br>BlogMailr lets you to publish your posts regardless of blogging tool you're using (Community Server, SubText, DasBlog, Single User Blog, WordPress, ...).  What it needs is a MetaBlogAPI support and what it gets is username, password and URL of your blog.  I haven't worked with DasBlog to know what's the feature you're talking about but BlogMailr isn't limited to pop-enabled emails.</p>
