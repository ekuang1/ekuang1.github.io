message: "<p>Sorry your message had been delayed.  There was one in the queue that was blocking a few others.  They have been unstuck and queue fixed.<br>As for some of the support, we even go beyond RSD to examine the content of the webpage like the meta generator or the URL for services like LiveJournal that don't support RSD.  Tried to make it work with as many as possible out of the box, so people didn't need to know an endpoint or anything<br>As for the HTML, we actually run all the HTML messages through a scrubber that strips out any tags/attributes that aren't HTML/XHTML valid, as well as any extra html, head, or body tags.  So it does a pretty good job.  The main issue is how Outlook uses its MsoNormal and an empty &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; line for blank lines, though we can hopefully resolve that.  For plain text messages, BlogMailr will automatically convert new lines to BR tags, though we'll likely add an option to disable that for power plain text users.<br>For the security, we do have the 8^36 random hash code, as well as valid sender checking, and we are also going to be adding in some more analytical checks, such as if we get X amount of messages from the same host in the past 10 minutes, block them, and so on, geared to prevent spoofing and brute force attacks.  We've also been talking about having an optional security token/PIN that would be required in the body, like [pin: 1234] in order for it to go through.<br>For remembering the address, that is why we put in the little vCard icon next to the email address, so you can add it as a contact. :)</p>"
