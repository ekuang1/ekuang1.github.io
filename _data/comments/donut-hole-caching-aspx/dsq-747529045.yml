message: "<p>I agree with Mohamed, having the full .NET backend is really useful at times. I'm not quite at the point of needing caching yet, but knowing how and where I can apply it is very useful!<br>Oh, and on-topic: I thought there was an unwritten rule in software engineering to use corny names and bad acronyms when it comes to naming your internal systems ;-) Either that or use codenames named after for instance X-men or funny alliterations (see: ubuntu release names).</p>"
