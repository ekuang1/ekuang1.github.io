message: "<p>I might have missed something but is there a reason you wouldn't just do:<br><code><br>public HomeController(): this(Membership.Provider) { }<br>public HomeController(MembershipProvider provider) { ... }<br></code><br>If your container has a MembershipProvider configured, it should invoke the proper constructor and inject it.  If no MembershipProvider is configured, it should call the no-arg constructor.</p>"
