message: <p>Another solution would be to inject a Provider factory, as opposed to the Provider itself.<br>public HomeController(IProviderFactory providerFactory){<br>  this.membership = providerFactory.GetMembershipProvider();<br>}<br>Then you have an AspNetProviderFactory (which can be passed in by StructureMap) that just returns the statically configured providers. Your tests use a fake provider factory that returns fake providers.</p>
