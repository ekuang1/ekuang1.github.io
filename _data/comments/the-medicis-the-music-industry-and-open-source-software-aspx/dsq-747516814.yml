message: <p>Rob, my company has had some success with implementing DotNetNuke on client projects. Unfortunately, we rarely have clients demanding commerce sites.<br>Do you find that you have clients that have that need that CSK fulfills?  That's an obvious means to funding it of course.<br>If we do have an e-commerce project come up, maybe our companies can work together on such projects if they are large.</p>
