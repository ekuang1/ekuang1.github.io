message: <p>That entitlement comment gets me. I choose to do a lot of things with my time (paid or otherwise), just because it's Open Source doesn't mean that people can get all Berkelely about it.<br>The Commerce Starter Kit is a pretty dern popular bit of software (we get about 180 downloads a day on average) that MS is benefitting from - it only makes sense that they support it somehow. Did I start out wanting this? No.<br>To be honest, I have to scramble to figure out how to monetize the CSK or else I'm going to have to make some hard decisions. I have some ideas that I hope are going to take off but if they don't it could turn into "Abandonware" real soon.<br>Which would suck. I like OS stuff - I have two pretty cool projects right now with about 10 others in the back of my mind. Oh the paaaainnnn<br></p>
