message: <p>Thanks david!<br>I can imagine that not all patrons were good to work under.  However, were the Medicis known to be good patrons?  Galileo stayed with them his whole life until he was accused of heresy. Even then they provided him shelter afterwards.<br>Whether you like that system or not would really depend on your patron.</p>
