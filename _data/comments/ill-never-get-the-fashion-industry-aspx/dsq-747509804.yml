message: "<p>Thanks man...  Now I'm going to see that image when I close my eyes at night...  I'm curious how an industry as profitable as fashion is turns a buck.  I figure it's analogous to the car industry bringing out concept vehicles that eventually get toned down for the average consumer.  But I can't see how bizzare shit like the above, not to mention even more frightening ensem's I'v seen in magazines, can be watered down enough to sell.  Can someone enlighten me???<br><br>BTW: I think that is a dude...</p>"
