message: "<p>@Troy I disagree with your \"historically safe\" comment. It's still \"historically safe\" to access <code>Request.ServerVariables[\"LOGON_USER\"]</code>. We haven't changed that.<br>For example, you can also access this value like so: <code>Request[\"LOGON_USER\"]</code>. Should we consider that a security <em>hole</em> as well now? <br>I ?<em>would</em> consider it a hole in your code if your code chose to do that and trust that value. But why would you access it in that way when it's widely known there's a completely safe manner in accessing that value?<br>We can only protect the developer from him/her self so much. At some point, the developer has to take responsibility for code that he or she writes.<br>Again, I'm not saying we won't look into this, as there's also no good reason to pass SERVER_VARIABLES into an action method as far as I can think of right now. I'm just saying I don't think the reasoning here is fully valid to call it a security \"hole\" as opposed to \"lure\".<br>As for the PHP comparison, this is a very different situation. PHP resulted in changing variable values. This is only about mapping parameter values. Parameters to an action method are explicitly user input, whereas a variable you're using in your code is definitely not.<br>As for the idea of using attributes to fine tune how the invoker maps requests to parameters, definetly something we're looking into already.<br></p>"
