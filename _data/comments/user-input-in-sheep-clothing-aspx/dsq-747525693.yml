message: <p>Sorry, I may not have been clear with my comparison with PHP. The problem I was refering to wasn't how the mapping was made, it was the conceptual model behind it.<br>If you map stuff from various sources directly to variables, it is not readily obvious where the value came from. In this case, you have multiple sources, of different safety levels, mapped at the exact same place, and conflicting with each other. It is not intuitive what could overlap what and how. The request accessor is already a step above since someone has to explicitely invoke it and you'll easily be able to see it in the debugger. This is a bit too magical.<br>And don't worrie, I definately understand how you must be feeling reading the comments... "Why the hell would a programmer use this feature for security sensitive code?!" is not very far from things the rest of us tells ourselves a lot "Why the -hell- would the accountant open 2 browser windows on the same page and edit the same record at the same time, and spam refresh and repost the form 16 times over!" :) Its still going to be the norm, not the exception.</p>
