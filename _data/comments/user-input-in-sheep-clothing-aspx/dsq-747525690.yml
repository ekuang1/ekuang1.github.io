message: <p>Indeed, that would work too. My gripe with the auto-mapping of -different types- of input remains even without the security issue. It just increase the surface area for possibilities of overlapping like crazy. You have to make sure POST, query string, cookies -and-server variable names never overlap? So not only you have to (as always) worrie about a malicious user not messing up the request, you -also- have to make sure no one else in your team did. So adding a totally unrelated page written by a totally different programmer has a -much- higher chance (the chance is always there regardless, but it is just multiplicated) of having a side effect.<br>The automatic injection of parameters is really, really sweet. I love it. I just dislike having to worrie about collisions to such a large extent. Poor QA trying to figure out why a page that worked perfectly well yesterday doesn't today, even though it wasn't modified whatsoever, etc :)<br>ASP.NET MVC isn't the Web Client Software Factory... it will be one of the default Visual Studio template eventually... people who eventually use it will do so after reading the marketing driven "magic" tutorials on the ASP.NET web site that try to show as much as possible that .NET does everything for you. Thats going to create one big, big mess, not unlike how InProc session and application recycling still does, to this day.</p>
