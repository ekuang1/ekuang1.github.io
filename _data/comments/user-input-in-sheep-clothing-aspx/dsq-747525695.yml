message: "<p>I'm not interested in arguing the semantics of a <i>hole</i> versus a <i>lure</i> with you, so I'll gladly concede the point and call it a \"lure.\"<br></p><blockquote>For example, you can also access this value like so: Request[\"LOGON_USER\"].</blockquote><p><br>While some part of my brain was aware you could do this, I've never accessed Server Variables in this way and have never seen it suggested that you do so. Whether or not I think Request[\"LOGON_USER\"] is a security hole is immaterial, but if I had my druthers: no, that would not work that way.<br>Moving to ASP.Net MVC will change the way developers do some things they have done for a long time. How many MVC developers are going to continue accessing querystring parameters via Request.QueryString[\"\"]? In some actions, sure, but for the most part most developers will be accessing it via the action parameters.<br></p><blockquote>We can only protect the developer from him/her self so much. At some point, the developer has to take responsibility for code that he or she writes.</blockquote><p><br>Absolutely, but surely you can see the line of thinking that might lead a developer to make a security mistake here:<br>1) I used to get QueryString parameters via Request.QueryString[\"\"]<br>2) Now I usually get QueryString parameters from my action parameters.<br>3) I used to get ServerVariables via Request.ServerVariables[\"\"]<br>4) Now I <b>CAN</b> get ServerVariables from my action parameters as well, so maybe that is how I'm <i>SUPPOSED</i> to.<br></p><blockquote>Again, I'm not saying we won't look into this...</blockquote><p><br>I'm glad to hear it. I'm confident you guys will come up with the appropriate solution.<br>I hope you haven't viewed this an attack on the MVC framework or on your team. I truly enjoy working with ASP.Net MVC and am looking forward to seeing what you guys put out in the next release.</p>"
