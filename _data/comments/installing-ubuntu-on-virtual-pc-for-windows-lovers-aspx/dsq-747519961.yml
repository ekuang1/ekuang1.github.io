message: <p>There is a simple fix for the mouse issue which will work even past various upgrades.  See my blog at <a href="http://www.nettakeaway.com/tp/article/294/ubuntu-704-and-no-mouse-on-virtual-pc" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nettakeaway.com/tp/article/294/ubuntu-704-and-no-mouse-on-virtual-pc">Ubuntu 7.04 and no mouse on Virtual PC</a> where I explain how to easily fix it.  Same issue and same fix for 7.10, btw.</p>
