message: <p>Interesting that you got this to work on Virtual PC.  MS usually only has the option to create Windows based images.<br>I've never really liked VMWare.  It always seemed to slow down my Windows box and would take forever to boot.  I might give Virtual PC a try when I have some spare time.<br></p>
