message: <p>Phil. Great post about Ubuntu, although I found 6.06 has the mouse problem too (?).<br>What to do next? You should definitely check out Amazon EC2 -- you can fire up your own Virtual Ubuntu or Fedoro or whatever. Or fire up 10 of them. Install MySQL, Apache, generally go mad!<br>Great to see you're an Amiga fan too - man, that machine was something. Might just have to check out Amiga Forever now.<br>P.S. Check out my blog for a couple of cool soccer posts.</p>
