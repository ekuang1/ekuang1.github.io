message: <p>Hey hey! So thanks for the tips about installing Ubuntu on virtual PC.<br>I was running VPC2007 at home and wanted to try out some of the Linux distros. Ubuntu 6.06 installed fine, and although it had mouse support it was sluggish etc. I thought that installing the "Virtual PC additions" package would solve that problem...but DAMN! i spent forever trying to work out how to install the goddamn thing. <br>I couldn't do it in the end. It was jsut tooooooo confusing. Has anyone else gopt any tips for installing those ADDITIONS onto an ubuntu setup?<br>I'm just having a ball with virtual PCs at the moment. They're really cool. Just for giggles..I am infecting my virtual machine with as many virii as I can. Just to see what the virii actually do? My anal security on my host os prevents me from doing it on that machine.....so woot! to the virtual ones.</p>
