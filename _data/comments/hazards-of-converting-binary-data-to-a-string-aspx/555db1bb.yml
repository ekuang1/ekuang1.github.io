message: Thank you so much for this article, even this many years since you wrote it.  I was struggling with binary encoding string data into an XML file using 'Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes)'. The XML serializer was throwing all kinds of errors at me that I couldn't resolve. 'Convert.ToBase64String(bytes)' ended the pain.
