message: "Thanks. I'm still trying to figure out what I have fouled up. When giving \"\\nHello\" in _stData and doing this...\r\n\r\nByte[] btaBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_stData.Trim());\r\n                return Convert.ToBase64String(btaBytes);\r\n\r\n.. I will get a \"nice looking\" Base64-string. However, if I take the response and do this...\r\n\r\nByte[] btaBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(_stB64Data.Trim());\r\n                return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(btaBytes);        \r\n\r\n... the return of this will be \"Hello\" (without the newline)...\r\n\r\nProbably something that I have misunderstood regarding how Base64 works :-("
