message: <p>If you use the system standard, then you're also in for heartache at some point due to computers having different standard encodings.</p><p>Just as an example, you might have had an old computer that ran Windows XP. And now, in 2016, you decided to upgrade to Windows Vista 3.11 for Workgroups, aka, Windows 8.1<br>(Windows 7 was Vista 2, and Windows 8 was Vista 3). :p</p><p>Guess who just changed their system standard encoding?<br>Now, you might say to yourself that this won't ever bother me, because I already run Windows Vista so I'm safe!</p><p>And then in the future, Windows switches over to UTF-8 as the standard.</p>
