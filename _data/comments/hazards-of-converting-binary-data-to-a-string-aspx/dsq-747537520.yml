message: "<p>I second the advice to use base64 encoding to transfer and/or save bytes as a string. Even if Windows-1252 doesn't seem to lead to data loss, you still shouldn't use it. There's a risk that code will assume System.Text.Encoding.Default but that value depends on the operating system's current settings. It could be different on another machine, it could be different on the same machine at a later point in time.<br>Phil, in your code snippets you seem to have mixed up the names for the encoded and decoded variables. In .NET, when using the System.Text.Decoder and System.Text.Encoder classes, encoding is the process of turning a string into bytes, and decoding is the process of turning bytes into a string.<br>I understand the confusion, because the question on Stack overflow regards the string as an encoding of arbitrary bytes (the bytes not representing text). But when we talk about text, the string is the decoded value, the byte array is the encoded value.<br>PS.
