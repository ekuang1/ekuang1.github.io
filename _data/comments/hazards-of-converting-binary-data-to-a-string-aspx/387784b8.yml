message: ISO-8859-1 (ISO_8859-1:1987) is a standardized single-byte encoding that I believe has every byte value mapped, so you can violate Skeet-ommendations all you want with that encoding. The obvious benefit is the more compact representation (vs base64), with the obvious downside that you're sending/storing little lies and misrepresentations wherever such strings go.
