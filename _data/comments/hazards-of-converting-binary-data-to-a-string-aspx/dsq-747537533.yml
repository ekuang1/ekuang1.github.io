message: <p>Okay, it's probably irrelevant for me to say this, but this is the first time I've felt like maybe I've actually truly progressed as a programmer. Not just because I knew this years ago, but because I'd have bet any sum of money there wasn't anything I knew that the vaunted Mr. Haack did not. Apparently, I've learned things.<br>However, knowing me, I probably learned this "the hard way" then researched why it wasn't working.</p>
