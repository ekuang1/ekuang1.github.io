message: <p>Good post. I suspect in some cases when such questions are asked the conversions between byte arrays and strings are, in fact, unnecessary. I get the feeling that people feel the need to move data around and/or store it as strings because they feel more comfortable with them, whereas sticking with byte arrays throughout might often be much more sensible.</p>
