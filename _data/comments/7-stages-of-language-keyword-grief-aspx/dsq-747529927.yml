message: <p>Some seem to be making this out to be an issue of resisting change or resisting new keywords or being a jack of all trades. It's not so much about adding a new keyword. It's about the line of reasoning that thinks a statically typed language needs dynamic features. Add features. Add useful features. But this smacks of "All the cool kids are using dynamic language. We need to have some of that, too." What does this really bring to the table? And what kind of problems does this bring?<br>The nerd in me says that the dynamic keyword is cool. It's nifty. The pragmatist in me is frightened at how it will be abused and mis-used by people that simply don't know any better and are spoon-fed their entire programming knowledge from MSDN. Horrible scary.</p>
