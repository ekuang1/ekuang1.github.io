message: <p>I don't think that's the right comparison to draw. It's more like this:<br>Sure, you could use a car as a garbage truck. It's not what it was originally designed for though. It works, but is, let's say, "less than optimal." However, I could design a new vehicle that is specifically designed for task of hauling garbage. <br>I'm not arguing that it's a bad idea to haul garbage with your car. In small quanities, it's fine. But if you're trying to accomplish something that it was not originally designed to solve, it will be painful and there are probably better ways to get the thing done.<br>After time, I could certainly add a dumper/fork-lift front end to my car, a trash compactor on the back, an optional snow plow on the front, and some painting equipment on the bottom to paint lines on the road. But eventually, it merely becomes a crappy car...</p>
