message: <p>everything I know about 'dynamic' I leared on <a href="http://haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="haacked.com">haacked.com</a> in the last 2 days so keep that in mind. From the little bit I've gleaned, it looks like a reasonable solution for the problem it seems to be targeted at. However, I always cringe whenever someone proposes a new language feature and when others seem wary they decry, "but you don't have to use it!". This is a really short sighted answer. The only way this is true is if you only ever work on your own code. When you work on other people's code or read their articles or grab code snippets you have to work with other people's code and that can mean using features you don't usually use. I found a really good example today on stack overflow. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1369725/why-arent-there-macros-in-c" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1369725/why-arent-there-macros-in-c">stackoverflow.com/.../why-arent-there-macros-in-c</a> Someone asked why C# doesn't have macros. Short answer? Macros are evil. But, someone else could just as easily said, "well I want macros, but you don't have to use them." Try telling a C/C++ programmer that they don't have to use macros. They don't have any choice. They can avoid writing any themselves, but the language and libraries and frameworks are littered with them (remember MFC?). Anyway, my 2 cents.</p>
