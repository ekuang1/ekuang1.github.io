message: <p>@Joe - If C did everything we wanted then there wouldn't be C#, now, would there?<br>New constructs/keywords don't bother me at all. They're easy to learn. What I see as overwhelming are all of the new frameworks and paradigms. I feel sorry for new developers that need to learn the BCL, WPF, MVVM, DI/IoC, TDD, BDD, DDD, ORM and about 10000 other acronyms.<br></p>
