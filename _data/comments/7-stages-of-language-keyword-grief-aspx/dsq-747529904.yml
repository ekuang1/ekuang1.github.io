message: <p>There are a lot of great things coming with C# 4.0, but I am seriously worried about having a boiling frog problem.  Those of us who embraced C# early on have had 6 years to digest all of the features added to the language.  But a someone new to the language has a very steep learning curve to get up to speed.  It is very difficult to put a junior person on an advanced team that is using the language features. <br>Don't get me wrong, they are great features and make my life easier.  But I think it's time for Anders and his team to go on vacation!!</p>
