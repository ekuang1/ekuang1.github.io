message: "<p>@Rob: my point was that you are rarely getting up in the morning \"to do something that requires dynamic coding\". You are getting up to create a blog/commerce/younameit application. You just happen to need dynamic aspects in places, but you don't decide up front that you will need dynamic aspects and that is certainly usually not the most important requirement of your project.<br>That is what makes C# attractive to me: I know it and I know for sure it will just get the job done with reasonable effort; same thing can't be necessarily said of other languages I like.<br>I'd also like to answer those commenters who fear that C# is a jack of all trades, good at none: have you guys seen Linq at all? Lambdas anyone? :D</p>"
