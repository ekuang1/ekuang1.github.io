message: <p>@Rob, I'm like Stephen Colbert man. I don't see "static" or "dynamic". I just see a language. The language has various properties and features. Some are useful all the time, some are useful occasionally.<br>It may well be that the future of languages are hybrids where trying to bucket the languages as being only static, only dynamic, only functional doesn't make sense. Many languages will exhibit some properties of each, even while being predominantly in one category.</p>
