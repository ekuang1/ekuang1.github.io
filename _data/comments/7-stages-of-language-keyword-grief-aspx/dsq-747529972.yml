message: <p>I don't like dynamic anymore than I like using weak typed hashtables. <br>However there are legit uses for dynamic like when you're interacting with a weak typed environment, like a Javascript object, other than that, I don't like the use of dynamic where strong typing could be used instead.<br>Let's try not to make "dynamic" be "Option Strict Off 2.0" ...<br></p>
