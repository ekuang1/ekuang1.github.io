message: <p>Who are we helping when we introduce these new features/keywords into a existing language? <br>The only people that are going to read our code are us, and other coders (other coders within our company, or other coders around the world if it's open source)<br>Let's say we have a bug in our program which someone else is trying to figure out, and we are using some new feature like method missing. If they've never seen this before, they've now got to spend a while figuring this new language feature before they even solve the bug.<br>They end up spending their time figuring out the syntax as well as the semantics of the program.<br>The C programming language it pretty much the same now as the original language. <br>C# however, has 4 times as many keywords and constantly has developers playing a Game of Fire and Motion (<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html">www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html</a>) instead of being able to concentrate on the actual code.
