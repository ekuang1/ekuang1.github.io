message: <p>@Bertrand I don't know latin but I hear it's almost as fun as French...<br>I was agreeing with you (if you didn't notice :) - it makes reflection a lot easier. Yes I think it will be a "cool feature", and yes it will be abused (as many things are). These aren't my issues...<br>Consider the case when you say "Hey, I might need something a bit more dynamic here...". You might then spin up some Reflective code and off you go. Dynamic makes this dead simple - which is lovely.<br>Fast-forward. Not a lot of people use Reflection every day but this bitchen keyword will do a lot to show just how flexible C# can be. This most likely will lead folks to try out some new and interesting ways to - well maybe come up with a Data Access tool that derives a SQL Statement from MethodMissing using Phil's stuff.<br>It's tantalizing! Sexxy! Fun! And there are languages for that :). <br>Now of course you're not going to change mid-project (in fact I'm fairly sure I didn't suggest that). But if you're a dual-wielding dev (which most are these days) you might just go with Ruby if you're going to do something that requires dynamic coding. Or PHP if you know it.<br>The power of C# is how "clean" it is, the type-safety of it all, and the speed. I'm sure the dynamic keyword is nice and fast, and I know it will trim the code - but the place that it takes the architect and the developer is well-trodden.</p>
