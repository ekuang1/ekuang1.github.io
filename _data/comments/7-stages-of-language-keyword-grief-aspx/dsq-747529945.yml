message: <p>@commenter, interesting that you bring up "stick-in-the-mud Java programmers." I look up to the modern JVM space as they very much take the approach "right tool for the right job." There is no shortage of great languages on the JVM that fill as specific void and do it well. It seems like the idea of spinning up another language on the CLR is unheard of to many people, while it's (dare I say) common on the JVM side.</p>
