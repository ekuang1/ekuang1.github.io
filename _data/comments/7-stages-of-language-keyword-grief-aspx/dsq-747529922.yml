message: <p>How would this argument play out if controversial keywords like var and dynamic were products in a supermarket?<br>"Look, those cheesy poofs get your fingers all orange."<br>"That's fine, it's worth it. I love cheesy poofs."<br>"Man, this store is getting to be a jack-of-all-trades bloated behemoth. I cannot BELIEVE they sell cheesy poofs. They totally stain your hands."<br>And what about features favored by the naysayers?<br>"They started selling LINQade? This store is SO innovative!"<br>Variety is the spice of life people. You can't stop bad code. Well-implemented tools are not a detriment.</p>
