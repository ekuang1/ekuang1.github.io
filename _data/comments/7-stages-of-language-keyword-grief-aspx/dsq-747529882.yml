message: "<p>Don't know if you meant to, but you kind of relegated everyone's negative comments to a kid who's cat died. The term \"ad absurdia\" springs to mind :).<br>I'm one of those grieving geeks :).<br>My issue isn't with the sound of the train, if you will, nor is it FUD. My thoughts are more along the line of ... \"why\"?<br>Bertrand summarized it to me nicely: \"because it makes tedious reflection tasks a snap\". Yay! That's a great reason and I like it. But why is the focus on addressing Reflection? I know this will make someone cranky - but it's how I roll :) - usually when people Reflect on things it's because they're trying to spin up some magic...<br>That's why I use it (and abuse it). Dynamic languages don't need to worry about this - code gymnastics (and contortions) are built in - it's the fabric of the experience.<br>Trying to work a static, typed, compiled language into that experience is... well it's weird. C# is awesome in so many ways but if I want MethodMissing well... you know what I'm thinking.<br>It's like that time we went to a strip club and we ended up at Chippendale's. I wanted to go, you wanted to stay and you said \"look - there's a cross-dresser... just don't worry about what's underneath\".<br>OK that didn't really happen but in a really NSFW way - well that's the kind of thing that's crossing my mind. <br>But - to back you up a bit - Cheese Moving is hard. But it doesn't mean that the Cheese has been moved properly :).</p>"
