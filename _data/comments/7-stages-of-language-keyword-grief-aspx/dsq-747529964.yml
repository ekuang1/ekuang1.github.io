message: <p>@commenter LOL, it may not sound like it, but I'm in full agreement with you. I think there are definite uses for the dynamic keyword. And as a geek, I'm a huge fan of the addition. <br>The fact that we live in a world where we have to be able to interop with technologies/languages outside of our stack, the dynamic keyword and the abilities it brings for interop alone is a win.<br>I'm just stating that I have a fear that C# is becoming more and more watered down with each successive release. As far as language trends go, this is how it always happens :). Sooner or later, a language will come along that will "beat out" C# and learn all the lessons that C# learned and do them better (hindsight is always 20-20). <br>I'm _definitely_ not against a language harnassing several different programming paradigms. But some ways of achieving that are better than others :). <br>LOL, keep in mind that a lot of my thoughts are merely "what ifs." Also, as much as I like to bring up languages like Smalltalk and LISP, my coworkers find it hard to believe that the first programming language I ever learned was C# :P.</p>
