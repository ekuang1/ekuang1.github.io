message: <p>I'm a novice so I'm still learning on the demo I seen they were making javascript calls using C# and they had full intellisense that makes good sense to me javascript is a pain to use it is not for the beginner or novice to be able to do more things with C# to me is a good thing I'd like to see more tutorials and examples on using it to replace javascript in a web application and really put it to work I find debugging javascript a nightmare with this new feature the nightmare might turn into a good dream and if we have to kill a few kittens along the way I'm down with that</p>
