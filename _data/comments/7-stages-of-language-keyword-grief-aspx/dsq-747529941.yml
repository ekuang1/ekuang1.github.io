message: <p>@Phil - I wasn't suggesting that using a dynamic language is evidence of bad design. Far from it. As I mentioned, I'm developing in a dynamic language right now and quite fond it. I'm merely questioning the wisdom of trying to force-fit a dynamic feature into a statically typed language.<br></p>
