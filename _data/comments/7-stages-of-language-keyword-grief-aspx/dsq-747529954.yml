message: <p>As fat as I'm concerned, if a language feature can help me write expressive code and help eliminate duplication, that language feature is a win.<br>All language features can be and will abused by developers who lack discipline and/or knowledge of design principles. Unless you are or work with that sort of developer why wouldn't you want your language to give you more power? <br>As far as the "jack of all trades, master of none" argument goes, I'd much rather have a language that allows me to apply a multi-disciplinary than to have to introduce multiple languages into my project. I'm all for polyglot if it's a necessity, but if I can easily do what I need to do in my primary language there's no need.</p>
