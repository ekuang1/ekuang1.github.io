message: <p>@David Nelson I didn't mean to be insulting. As you might have noticed from the tone of the post, it was largely tongue in cheek. I don't think everyone goes through all 7 stages. Maybe they go through none.<br>Not to mention, similar to Kurt Cobain's quote around Paranoia, just because you're spreading FUD, doesn't mean it's not true. ;)</p>
