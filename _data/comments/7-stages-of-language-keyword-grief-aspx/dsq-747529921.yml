message: "<p>@Bertrand - getting up in the morning I think about coffee :). If I thought about anything dynamic that often, I wouldn't be having this discussion - that's my point.<br>Recall, if you will, a discussion you and I had on campus during lunch one day RE dynamic languages... <br>It's not nearly as simple as you're putting it. If you decide you're going to flex *anything* dynamic - well it's woven into your app. You flex a language and its strengths, or you don't. Dynamic is not the strength of a typed language in the same way that fire isn't something water produces to warm itself (unless you add magnesium... but...)<br>C# is attractive to you because you know *what it can do with the framework*. Not what *it as a language* can do. If you worked with Django/Ruby/whatever every day - I think we'd be having a different conversation :). I know how much you love Ruby :).<br>C# is becoming a jack/trade language. You said it in the previous sentence - \"I know it and I know it will get the job done\". At some point you have to ask: is a hybrid class better or should I just roll a Mage?</p>"
