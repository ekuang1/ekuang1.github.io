message: "<p>You forgot step 8: Jump Ship.<br>A new language comes in, that does exactly what the language used to do well before it got bloated, +/- the things that worked and those that didn't, clean up the mess, etc.<br>How do you think C# caught on in the first place? People went through the first 7 steps with Java, then went on to step 8.<br>That said, my issue personally is that the whole point of the CLR is so that there can be languages for everyone, but the VB-sation of C# is leaving a gapping whole: there's no clean and easy strict language anymore.<br>Make C# into VB with curly braces if you want, just make sure to fill the gap that its leaving.</p>"
