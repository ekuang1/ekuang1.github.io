message: <p>"QA is very motivated to find bugs"<br>Phil, in the spirit of "explanation", what does the above sentence mean to you and the gang @Microsoft? <br>We're running a flavor of agile here that only defines defects where they contradict the predefined tests for a story or "use case". Everything else just "bugs" the user. <br>I am curious how the rest of the world looks at the myriad of things QA finds. <br>-jason<br></p>
