message: <p>@Phil "ASP.NET 3.5. ASP.NET MVC 1.0 will be an example of an OOB release."<br>Hi,<br>Will this Asp.Net MVC ( After OOB ) will be included in framework 3.5/4.0 as it is, or there is possibility from your team to make changes to OOB version also before including in Framework.<br>Whats more safe to work with Asp.Net MVC as "OOB RTM" or "Asp.Net MVC included in Framework".<br>Thanks<br>SoftMind</p>
