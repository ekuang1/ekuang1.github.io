message: <p>Since Preview 4 seems to have only been released on Codeplex, is it more sensible to think of this as a Interim release and Preview 5 will get released to ASP.NET as a proper preview?<br>I guess at the end of the day it doesn't matter too much. I'm just happy to see plenty of release and will look forward to daily builds if it ever gets to that point. <br>From a professional point of view the OOB/RTM will be great.</p>
