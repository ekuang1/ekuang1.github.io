message: <p>In American English, <em>to whine</em> is the act of complaining alot.  The word sounds like <em>wine</em> (aka vino). <br>So when someone is really whining, sometimes people will ask them if they would like cheese with that whine, as a joke.<br>Yeah, it's really not that funny.  You are not missing much.</p>
