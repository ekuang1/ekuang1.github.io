message: <blockquote>Of course the potential for abuse is high and the rewards are low...</blockquote><p> Agreed! I see such proxies quickly becoming a sort of <i>Open Relay</i> system not unlike those used by email spammers.<br>Perhaps a slightly less <i>open</i> solution is to have the hosting providers make a track/ping-back service available to their hosted applications. Then they could restrict access to the service to only allow thier clients to use the proxies.</p>
