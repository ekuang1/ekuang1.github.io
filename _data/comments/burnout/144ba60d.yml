message: Thanks for sharing this. It is not easy having the courage to write about this. Yes, burnout is real, and sadly, most of us think it is not going to affect us, until it is too late. But I am happy that you realized it, and learned from the experience. You should be fine now. It is really sad that most of the young people around us at work don't realize that they will be dealing with burnout quite soon, because in the end they are not characters out of a Marvel movie..
