  I can completely relate. I appreciate your candor and what you've shared for the last year and change. I'm starting to take a break starting at 5pm tomorrow, for at least a month or two. When my doctor suggested that a little Lorazepam might help when I'm on the edge, it was time to start looking at my choices.



  I get the writing code bit, too. I just soft-launched POP Forums as a hosted solution, after years as just an OSS project, with no idea if anyone will buy it, and I'm zen about it. I want it to make a little money so I can have the joy of working with someone else on it! I'm not sure that hitting aspects of business I'm not usually responsible for is going to put me at ease.



  Keep writing though... you aren't complaining, you're just verifying that a lot of us have the same problems.
