message: "Can definitely relate to this.  I recently \"took control\" and started working from home more, but was surprised when it seemed to exasperate burnout.  I had more control, but the other items on that list seemed worse.  \r\n\r\nForgive me if this is too \"Debbie Downer\", but I do worry that some of it has no solution in contract software development.  To get paid, we have to work on other peoples' dreams and at least in my customers,  items 2-6 are all issues.  \r\n\r\nIn my mind, the real solution is building my own Saas or other product(s).  I've done some with limited success, but routinely find myself blocked by the \"day job\".   I either legit don't have time for a side project, or due to said burnout, don't feel like building my own thing after spinning all day on my customers' projects.  I don't have the financial freedom to drop customers and take care of my family while I do my own thing.  So I burn, baby, burn.\r\n\r\nMy main consolation is 1) I'm taking care of my family and that's worth some sacrifice on my part 2) this too shall pass- when the time is right I'll build my Saas and retire and fish all day."
