message: <p>I want to roll it back to 2001 retro-style, and talk about Web .NET:<br>Can anyone help expand this? I'm thinking MS Comic Sans with a fixed font size, pregnant 60-character URLs, IE-only, frames aplenty, gratuitous style tags like a Word HTML export, two page features fighting to stick content in the same named pop-up, smuggled smart-quotes, and loading up on animated GIFs like they were going out of style.</p>
