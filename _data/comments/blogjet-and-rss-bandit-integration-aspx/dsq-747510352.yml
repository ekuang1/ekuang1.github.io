message: <p>Sorry to be way off topic, but I still can't even get RSS Bandit to work right..  My options say to update all feeds every 60 minutes, and I leave it running all the time, but my most recent <a href="http://haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="haacked.com">haacked.com</a> posts are from a week ago (last one is "This is So Me" on 10/29.)  Interestingly enough, Joel on software comes through just fine, and if I right click and say "Update Feed", everything shows up.  Any ideas?</p>
