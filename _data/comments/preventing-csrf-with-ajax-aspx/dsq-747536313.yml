message: <p>Thanks Phil, this was exactly what I was after. <br>I modified my implementation slightly to add a jQuery ajaxPrefilter to append the token on the client side, and used your AuthFilter globally and added:<br>if(filterContext.RequestContext.HttpContext.Request.HttpMethod.ToLower() != "post")<br>{<br>   return;<br>}<br>to target all form Post's...<br>This seems to work pretty nicely.</p>
