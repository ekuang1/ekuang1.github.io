message: <p>Wow, snarkiness!  The criticism may be valid but you guys could at least try to make it constructive.  The framework never prevented you from doing this yourself, and it didn't take a whole lot of effort to implement.<br>Phil, thanks for taking the time to code this up and provide it to all of us freeloaders.  Some of us appreciate it.<br></p>
