message: <p>I ran into this same problem yesterday which is funny, but I started realizing that recovering from a successful/failed AJAX request is really the issue and passing the antiforgery token is the trivial part.<br>What do you do when the AJAX request is complete and the user is left on the page? I thought the token had a one time use, which makes every subsequent ajax request from a single page invalid, unless you can generate a token an pass it back on every JSON request. <br>Also the Html.AntiForgeryToken() helper assumes you always want an input html tag. What if you just want to set the token cookie and return a new token?<br>I like what Kazi suggested, by adopting the view wide forgery token, this could be alleviated and by convention, the MVC ajax libraries could just update it if it exists on the page to a new value.</p>
