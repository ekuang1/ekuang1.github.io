message: <p>"__RequestVerificationToken"? What a long ugly id it is. Still one of  those hardcoded id and names of ASP.NET generated HTML. The more I use ASP.NET's generated code, the more I find myself stuck at customizing a project furthermore. I'd rather prefer to write the anti-forgery system on my own (just like membership, SSO, etc.). <br>Your article helps me in finding where I need to implement my own framework. Thanks.</p>
