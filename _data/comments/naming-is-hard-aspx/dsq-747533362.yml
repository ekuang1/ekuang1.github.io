message: <p>Hi,<br>I have visited your blog and have found it helpful, mostly about the information about patent invalidation searches. Invalidation search is done to identify documents or prior use that may reduce the claim scope for one or more claims of a granted patent or to invalidate a granted patent. Thanks for the great post, very helpful information here.</p>
