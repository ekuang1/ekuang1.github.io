message: <p>Phil, could you talk about why you don't prefer the N prefix?  I think there is a lot of value in using the N prefix.  It gives the .Net community something that lets them recognize a piece of software that belongs to their area/community.<br>For instance Apple has used the i prefix for many of their product names.  At one point they tried to get away from it by going to Apple with the Apple TV but I would say it was a failed trial since they have named no new products with Apple instead of the i prefix (iPad).<br>As the community grows and the number of projects open source or otherwise grow there are so many tools/applications it is becoming a task in itself to follow everything, we have Entity Framework, .Net's flavor of MVC, Microsoft Ajax Minifier, subtext, Oxite, BlogEnine.NET, dasBlog, FlexWiki, ScrewTurn wiki, Umbraco, Orchard, DotNetNuke, mojoPortal, Splendid CRM, Yet Another Forum, DotShippingCart, nopCommerce, and dashCommerce.  And I didn't even go into Open Source Tools.  Which ones of these are run by Microsoft and which are run by other teams?  I don't know without looking them up.  <br>I know this is a complex issue and I am sure there is a good reason to not prefer the N prefix.  I just want to hear more about it and understand the logic.  Thanks!</p>
