message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I think everyone agrees that there is a need for a name change, but the names listed are terrible. As you said, this is Microsoft and it looks like it's going to name it to a quality that some random nobody starting a project might do (not implying anything about subtext, it's a good name).<br>Firefox may have followed a similar model, but Firefox is an excellent name for a web browser (better than, Opera, Chrome and Safari IMO). Why don't you take more time to think of a professional level name (that meets your criteria)?<br>(I'll try and get some names that meet your criteria later on when I have time)<br>&lt;/internet rage&gt;</p>
