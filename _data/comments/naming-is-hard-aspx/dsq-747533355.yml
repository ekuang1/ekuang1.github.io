message: <p>@RandomBen you bring up some great points. I don't like just slapping on the "N" prefix because I like project names that stand on their own and aren't Silo'd. For example, I like names like Subtext, Cucumber, Mercurial, Git etc.<br>However, I'm warming up to it more as you do make a good point that it becomes immediately recognizable as being part of the .NET community. Problem is there are sort of three affixes that do this now for the most part.<br>1. The "N" prefix. As in NHibernate.<br>2. The "Dot" prefix. As in DotTrace. <br>3. The ".NET" suffix. As in BlogEngine.NET.<br>In any case, it looks like NFetch is in the lead and it's growing on me. It'll never meet NuPack in my mind, but I can live with it. <br>It's the product itself in the end that people will really care about.</p>
