message: <p>I'm surprised that nobody thought to do a Google/Bing search on NuPack when you first decided to merge the name. Especially since we already had issues with "Nu" and "Nu Project" (nude photography) being searchable.<br>I think the main issue people have is that Microsoft keeps touting this as open-source and community involvement, but just like how NuPack was release as a big surprise, we "the community" wake up to hear that "Oh, btw we're changing the name."<br>There was no discussion about, "hey, we're getting pushback from others about the name, what do you guys think?"<br>And then your little group came up with 4 names that are frankly quite lame.<br>I understand that this is Microsoft and perhaps this is just how it is and we have to live with it. <br>I've contributed to both Nu and NuPack, but I'm not feeling the "community" thing yet. It still feels like a Microsoft project with a little bit of "hey, you guys can work on these really minor things to give us some OSS cred."<br>Well, that's my 2c.<br></p>
