message: "<p>I completely understand the reason for the name change. I also understand the need for MS to keep some control on this decision if it's a MS project. That's all cool. I just wasn't too thrilled about the name choices (and still not).<br>However, more than not liking the name choices, I just wish this would all be over and we'd have the new name already. Even if it's one I don't like. I just want my life back and to be able to move on. I got up at 5AM today and the first thing I did was do a twitter search for #nupack and #nupacknuname. It's sad really. <br>I need closure. Somebody hold me.</p>"
