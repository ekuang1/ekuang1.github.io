message: <p>Kiliman, regarding the name change, we did consult with a few members of the community. We pretty much followed the model that Firefox did when they renamed. When legal issues are involved such as trademark, it's not like we have a choice.<br>As for using the community to generate names, we were concerned about domain squatting. But maybe that fear is overblown. That's why I'm relaxing things a bit.<br>Also, this is officially an Outrrcurve foundation project and we're trying to run it like any other OSS project would run you wouldn't start contributing core features to Linux on day one, right? We really appreciate yor contributions in particular and expect to see deeper contributions (we hope!) as time goes on. Give us a fair shake, we'll get better at this as time goes on.</p>
