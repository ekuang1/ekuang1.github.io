message: <p>Pete and James:<br>I think this falls under a basic learning/brain style.  I only read comments if I don't understand the code.  My thinking style is much closer to code than vernacular text.  I also ignore pictures and diagrams in books.  Give me a huge interface description document and I'll chug along.  Make me stare at a uml diagram and my brain will freeze up.  I'm obviously wired a little different than my awesome coworkers that can take a complicated concept and reduce it to a ppt slide.<br>So you see my bias, but I do think methods are better just because you have to type those letters in order to use that code.  The compiler won't force me to read the comment.  But if you maintain your comments, good for you.  I'm sure your coworkers love you.</p>
