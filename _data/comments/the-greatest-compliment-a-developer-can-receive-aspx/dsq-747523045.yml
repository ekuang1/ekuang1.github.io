message: <p>I completely agree with Uncle Bob’s comment.  <br>There are ways to improve code quality, specifically pair programming.  There is no excuse for sloppy coding!  <br>Sure, as developers we can cut other developers some slack, but more importantly we as developers must concentrate finding ways to deliver cleaner, more readable and highly efficient code.  <br>Re-factor mercilessly!  Plan this re-factoring into your project!  Pair up!  <br>The problems depicted by this article are prevalent in waterfall style software projects of the 90s, where you would have scenarios where some cowboy developer (possibly me in a past life) would shoot off into the distance coding a deliverable in isolation for 2 weeks only to come back and have their sole ripped out of them by everyone else in the project for the bad quality work.  It’s not fair on the developer and its irresponsible of the development managers.  <br>These problems don’t exist, or at least are extremely rare when using more current development methodologies that are based on XP techniques.</p>
