message: "<p>It's rare that we ever get any respect from our developer brethren in this day and age. Sadder still that instead of gleefully refactoring some tiny \"boo-boo\"'s from a friend's code base we call them up and tell them what d-nozzels they are. There have been many times when I've inherited some terrible code and in those times, if I know the dev I will honestly ask why they did some things. Most times, it's as you (or commenters) have said \"I was in a hurry\" or \"my wife was in labor\" or \"didn't know any better at the time\" or whatever. Otherwise, I let it go. And if I'm lucky enough that the person, more or less, made good choices, I usually take that person to lunch to learn more! <br>I loved this article, Haacked. Sometimes mom is right, if you don't have anything nice (read: constructive or helpful) to say maybe it shouldn't be said at all. I've stopped apologizing for ever nit-pick thing that people can complain about and learned to embrace my personal coding dialect.</p>"
