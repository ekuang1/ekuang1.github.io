message: <p>That sample comment was hilarious, and it reminds me of the way I comment.  I sometimes get humourous in my comments just to lift the spirits of future programmers.  I had to write a rather complex HTTP handler that did alot of different things.  I put a comment at the top that said something to the effect of "Yes, I know at first glance this code just doesn't look right.  But trust me, it is.  Think I'm full of it?  Call me at [cell number] or email me at josh420@josh420.com and I will set you straight."<br>The handler isnt expected to change for a year or two, it will be interesting to see who gets it next!  Hopefully I will get a compliment like you did.  <em>I</em> thought it was well-written!</p>
