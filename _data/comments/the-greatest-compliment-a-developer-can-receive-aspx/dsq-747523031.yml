message: <p>@Joe - Totally agree.<br>@Mike - I'm not a Java programmer. My personal tastes is bracket on its own line except in the case of code within a view template file. That seems to be the general C# convention, though I'm sure many will disagree. My point is neither choice is the "Right" one, but developers have a tendency to let what is really a trivial decision lower their esteem for another developer.</p>
