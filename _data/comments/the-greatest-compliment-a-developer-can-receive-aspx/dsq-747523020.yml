message: <p>I once read the following in a real comment:<br><code><br>// I'm sorry for what is about to follow, but it's 2AM and I can't<br>// do any better.<br></code><br>For my money he <strong>could</strong> have done better.  He could have gone home, gotten some rest, and then come back refreshed and finished in much less time.<br>There is no excuse for writing sloppy code.  Sloppy code slow you, and everyone else who has to read it, down.  The cumulative effect of sloppy code is far greater than the benefit the author perceived when he made the mess.<br>And don't give me that old "time to market" saw.  Nonsense!  Clean code makes you go fast.  The only way to go fast is to keep your code clean!  Messy code always slows you, and everyone else around you, down.  <br>No excuses.  No mess.  Keep your code clean.<br></p>
