message: <p>Funny.  The way that happened for me was a few years after I'd designed a mini-computer sidecar custom-billing process to a slow-to-change mainframe system.  When they finally got around to incorporating the sidecar system into the mainframe, one of the developers met me by chance at an ACM meeting.  You know, she said, I am converting your file designs to the IMS database, and it was so easy, almost as if you'd designed your solution for IMS.  All I could do was grin.<br>What had happened, along with documentation of the data design where she could easily abstract the essentials, was that I used two indexed files for record sets that were reciprocally foreign-keyed between the two sets.  but I had carefully designed the insert-delete-replace rules so that failed transactions would leave tombstones but no links to nonexistent records.  This was all accomplished by application logic.  There was no DBMS, and I did no record locking.  <br>In working it all out, including the failure modes, I had used a hierarchical data model and she was benefitting from that in converting to a hierarchical DBMS.  (It would have gone over to an RDBMS just as simply.)<br>Of course, I'm sure there's someone who would insist what a dumb design that was.</p>
