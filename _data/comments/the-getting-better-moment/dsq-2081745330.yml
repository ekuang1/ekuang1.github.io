message: <p>While not software related, it was a getting better moment.  I was in the Marine Corps after high school, as a crew chief on the UH-1N.  This means I was a mechanic as well as an aircrewman. As a young crew chief, I took a tool from one aircraft, that was currently being tested (lots of start up shutdown, go flying stuff), and moved to another aircraft to do some work. I didn't tell the crew chief doing the testing that I took the tool.  Because of that I wasted his time, and imposed some stress on him, because he thought he had lost the tool in question. And in case you don't know, a lost tool is a BIG deal, because if it is "lost" next to a drive shaft, that helicopter may not come home. Needless to say, I was "taught" my lesson. But most importantly, I had a Staff Sergeant who told me, "You can do one of two things; you can come to work tomorrow, pouting because you made a mistake and be lesser for it, or you can learn from your mistake, and come to work tomorrow with your head held high and apply that knowledge to a new day."  I resigned myself to that latter, and because of it, I became a better crew chief.  Now I get to apply the same notion to the software that I write.</p>
