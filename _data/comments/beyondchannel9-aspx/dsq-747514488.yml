message: <p>Ah yes, it was me not Scoble.  As Phil mentioned, he knows the whole dev team in some form or another and we chose him as one of the first people to see it.  I was also looking for that free beer at MIX...<br>And can I say Phil, what a nice looking blog you have, that Live Comment thing is great.  I really need to fix mine up, but as you've mentioned a couple times, the cobbler's kids have no shoes :p</p>
