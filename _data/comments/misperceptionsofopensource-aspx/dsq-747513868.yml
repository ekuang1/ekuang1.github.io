message: <p>I personally think that many developers could dramatically improve their skills by working on a medium sized OS project.  I have learned more by working on DotNetNuke than I ever learned in working on my regular job.  You come in contact with a much broader range of developers than you ever will in an office setting, and you are exposed to a broader range of thinking.  In my office, the closest I ever came to some of the best and brightest in the development community was seeing someone speaking onstage or reading their book/blog.  Since working on an OS project, I have had the opportunity to trade ideas with some of the best .Net developers in the world.   <br><br><br><br>OS expands your world beyond the four walls of your cubicle and that is a very good thing.</p>
