message: "<p>I couldn't agree more. What motivates participants in the \"Open Source Community,\" as it were, varies greatly as you look across the wide landscape of open source projects.  Sure the _big_ OSS projects like Apache, Eclipse, *nix, etc... are going to draw a lot of attention from more commercial groups because they see benefit (read: profit) in those projects. And yes, the participants in the smaller/niche (yet far more numerous) projects are often motivated by the factors you listed above. I think that many do want to \"work on something more interesting than the boring data-in data-out systems they build at work.\" <br><br><br><br>While my real J-O-B isn't just a data-in data-out system, its not a free-form and open to change as subText is. And I enjoy that aspect of the subText project.  Though, I will have to admit that it is also nice to get a little recognition from peers :)<br><br><br><br>-Steve<br><br></p>"
