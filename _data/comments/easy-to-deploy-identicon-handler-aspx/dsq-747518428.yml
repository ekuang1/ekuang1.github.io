message: <p>Yup, it's perfectly clear now, volume always helps ;-).<br>"hash=hash-of-ip-address"<br>What hash is it looking for? I've tried using the Code member in the Util class to hash the IP, I've tried a hashcode, which doesn't work b/c the IP is rehashed in the handler. Red X's abound, and the resulting hash looks way off.<br>As is usually the case with me, I'm sure I'm overlooking something glaringly obvious and simple.</p>
