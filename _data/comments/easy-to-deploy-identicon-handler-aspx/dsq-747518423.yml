message: <p>You're a life-saver. I wanted a fairly anonymous way to show the last five authors on my site and this fits that bill perfectly. Excellent examples the other day on what an identicon was and great followup today with the handler port.<br>I've implemented identicons at <a href="http://www.aintmysite.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.aintmysite.com">AintMySite.com</a>, a site that anyone can edit at any time as they see fit (as a result, warning, may or may not be work safe). I think it's a perfect solution for my needs.</p>
