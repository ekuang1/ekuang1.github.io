message: <p>Hi there,<br>I loved the idea, but decided to implement it for Email addresses instead of IP addresses. And the result was STUNNING!(seriously!)<br>So now, instead of Gravatar (which is based on Email) I use Gravatar and the default picture is an Identicon. Best part is. Once the identicon is created, I cache it so I don't have to create it once more :)<br><br>Thank you that was very helpful</p>
