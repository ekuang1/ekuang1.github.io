message: <p>I am with WH4L and trying to get SSL installed. <br>Mahud, are their SSL servers different than the normal ones? <br>I am still trying to figure out how to get my <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> apps moved to the SSL server if it is different. My support issues were generally resolved quickly except the SSL ticket which is now open for 5 days. Also, their support forum has nothing in it. StartLogic seems to have a better knowledge base.<br>Do you guys recommend any other provider for <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> 2.0 with sql 2005, sharepoint, and win 2003 support?</p>
