message: <p>I signed up for a shared account at <a href="http://webhost4life.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="webhost4life.com">webhost4life.com</a>.  To be honest it was almost comical.  Their support is useless, "Urgent Server Down" ticket that I sent took 4 days for first response.  The response to the site being down (control panel was down as well meaning the entire server was down), was to clear the DNN log file and that should bring the server back up.  <br>Control panel is a complete joke.  Crashes almost hourly.  You are lucky if it works at all.  At least you can screw webhost4life with it.  Go ahead and change permissions on a large directory with the control panel.  It will crash the server.  Happens all the time.  <br>Biggest joke of a host, and hardly any professionals there. Heck the fact that their own website at <a href="http://webhost4life.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="webhost4life.com">webhost4life.com</a> is down an awful lot should be a omen.<br>Get out, I did.  They are crap and a waste of money. <br>There where 1744 different databases (used query to count them), on the MSSQL server I was on.</p>
