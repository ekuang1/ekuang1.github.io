message: <p>I've had a few issues with their up-time in the past but in the last couple days these guys can't seem to stop from shooting themselves in the foot.  A day ago they changed a setting that made my size quota for files 0 bytes - so when I uploaded a file, it would replace what was there with an empty file.  <br>Just today I noticed several of my sites on the same account are down.  At first I thought the server might be down, so my trouble ticket had a '1' level, meaning server down.  It's been three hours and no response.  You'd think that a minute after that kind of ticket was received the least they would do is send a response saying they saw the ticket.<br>I host sites for my wife's and two friends businesses - it's not like I make any money off of them, but their sites are too important to tolerate this lack of dependability.  I won't be renewing my contract.</p>
