message: <p>Yes I completely agree.  I used the service for about 2 weeks.  After that I was fed up with the slow speed, 60kb max downloads, so pages loaded very slow.  I was using a DotNetNuke site and that made it even slower.  I called them 10 times, and 35 days after i cancelled my account, I still didn't have my refund.  I called up paypal, and created a compaint on their Resolution Center, within an hour I had $120 back.  They charged me $140 in full, but like you said, Setup is non-refundable.  I guess its not too bad, but I was worried that I wasn't going to get my money back.  Persistanced paid off, but beware, Never use Webhost4Life, they are the worst webhost!  They suck, and make money off of referrals, thats why you see good things about them.  Its all bullshit, this is the truth about webhost4life.<br><br><br><br>I repeat, Never sign up with them, you have to pay a year's worth the service in advanded, they are complete bull shit!</p>
