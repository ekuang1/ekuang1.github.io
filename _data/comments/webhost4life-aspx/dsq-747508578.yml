message: <p>It took WH4L 6 weeks to get an SSL installed for me! At one point, I had to walk the tech through some of the IIS setup for our site over the phone. Do not use these guys. Sure it's cheap, but when I calculated my hourly rate against the savings I THOUGHT I was getting, I was loosing money. We are pulling all of our client accounts from them after their last fiasco of dropping our SSL (yes, the one it took an excessive amount of time to setup in the first place). Again, steer clear unless you want hassles.</p>
