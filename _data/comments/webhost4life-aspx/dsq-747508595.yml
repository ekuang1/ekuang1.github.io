message: <p>I agree with everyone about "try it now" when they know they have not fixed it.  They ask for all the info to duplicate the error but they never check to see if it was fixed?  This company services and customer service really sucks.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I had decided just to use it to manage my email list since I couldn't get any other app to work but I cannot even get it to work because of an out dated jamil component.  I am on email 4 day 7 as I write this and to be honest I don't think it will ever be resolved. I sent them the error message but they just don't get it.  This was a real waste of money.</p>
