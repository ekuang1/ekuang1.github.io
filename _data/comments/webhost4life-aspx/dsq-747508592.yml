message: <p>Webhost4life should be avoided at all costs! I agree.  Their standard reply to the complaints is "Try it now".  That is great, but out of 7 days I have had 4 outages from Service Unavailable to SqlServer does not exist.  Their support is quick to respond but that is irrelevant if they cannot keep a site live for more than 48 hours.  It requires contacting them to resurect the site.  By the way, I am using the semi-dedicated account which costs $79 a month.  But I kid you not that my $15 seekdotnet site performs extremely better than webhost4life.  Bottom line, save yourself the headache and avoid them at all costs.</p>
