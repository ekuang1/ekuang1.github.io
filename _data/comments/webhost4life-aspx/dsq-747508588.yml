message: <p>We have been with <a href="http://webhost4life.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="webhost4life.com">webhost4life.com</a> for the past 3 years. We have around 25 Shared accounts, 2 VPS Email server, 1 Dedicated windows server.<br>We didnt had much problems with them, but don't say 100% good. They have problems what other have. We tried many hosting companies, but we see these guys are soo good. Their support is not soo good, as we need repeatly pull their legs. But they have now Live chat, so things are easy now.<br>Their VPS Email server is fine, going good. But we had some initial setup problems, but now its been sorted out and things are running now.<br>If you think of getting a 7-Star rated support with this cheap charge, then i think webhost cant help much.</p>
