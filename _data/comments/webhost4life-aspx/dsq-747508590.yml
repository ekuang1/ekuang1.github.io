message: <p>I have a php site that loaded 100% yesterday.  Today it is blank like there is a code error somewhere.  The page runs 100% on a different server.<br>Do these people hack our pages and steal code from it?<br>I also lost 1 table out of a huge database during the week.<br>How is it possible?<br>Bee with them for 3 years.  That was 3 years to long!!!</p>
