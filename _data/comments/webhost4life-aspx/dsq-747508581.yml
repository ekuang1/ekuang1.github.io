message: <p>They answer trouble tickets.  AND TROUBLE TICKETS ONLY.  They never answer the phone.  I doubt they're busy 24/7 with high call volumes.  I waited for 3 hours on hold.  I was disgusted and hung up.  I have sent in testimonials of praise for their rapid response on trouble tickets, but I need to voice that they're extremely poor when it comes to phone support.  THERE IS NONE</p>
