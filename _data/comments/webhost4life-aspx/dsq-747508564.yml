message: <p>This host is to be AVOIDED at all costs! They list a large number of features but...<br><br><br><br>1.  It took several phone calls and emails to get it set up in the first place.  Just a standard setup, nothing special.  The features were unusable for several hours once they did manage to set it up because the control panel is the hokiest thing I've ever seen and parts of it wouldn't even load until they fixed it (which took 3 phone calls and an email).<br><br><br><br>2.  Support sucks.  Their site has a quote from a so-called customer that says their support is "facinating".  This description takes on a whole new meaning after dealing with their incompetence.<br><br><br><br>3.  They tried to charge me multiple times to set up the crappiest ecommerce tool EVER.  This thing is totally unusable!  It took 2 days for them to get the admin interface to work at all.  Like I want to have them host my ecomm when they can't even get it working for 2 days.  Cummon!<br><br><br><br>4.  To top it all off, even though their site states that they have a 45 day moneyback guarantee, this is completely false! I gave up after a weekend of goofing around with the piece of crap.  They then said "OH, well the money back guarantee doesn't apply to the setup fee".  Phych.<br><br><br><br>All in all, a HORRIBLE host.  I have <a href="http://1and1.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="1and1.com">1and1.com</a>, and although they charge a premium to add ASP and SQL, it is worth it because at least it works!<br><br><br><br></p>
