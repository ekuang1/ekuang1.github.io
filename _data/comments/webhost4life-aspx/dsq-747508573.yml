message: <p>I used webhost4life for 3 months and it's working perfectly fine.  I can always get to their support as well.  Maybe they've gotten better?  I alway see good posts and bad posts all over the net with every hosting company.  I wonder if there's 1 hosting company that have nothing but good posts.  I would stay away from <a href="http://1and1.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="1and1.com">1and1.com</a> for sure.  1and1 = bad<br><br><br><br>I gotta say so far, I am very happy with webhost4life.  Webhost4life = good  :p<br><br></p>
