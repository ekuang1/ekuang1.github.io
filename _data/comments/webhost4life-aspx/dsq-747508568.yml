message: "<p>I've just finished moving my sites the heck off this host, and will never use them again. We had frequent outtages, either because of a \"Server Unavailable\", or simply not being able to connect. I never went a week without at least one 30+ minute outtage during my tenure there. <br><br><br><br>I expect some downtime in a shared environment; I'm saying that even taking that into account, the site was down far too much.<br><br><br><br>Support? The only reponse I ever received in the ticketing system was \"Try it now\" even after explicitly asking for a cause and what is being done to resolve the issue.<br><br><br><br>Oh, and just for fun, open Enterprise Manager and count the number of databases on your server. You'll be lucky to get less than 700.<br><br><br><br>Their home page is a gigantic pack of lies. CNN doesn't have a speedometer (and never have); they are not rated #1; and according to my watchdog graphs of a couple of sites, they're uptime rate is in the low 80% range.<br><br><br><br>Stay away from this host.<br><br><br><br></p>"
