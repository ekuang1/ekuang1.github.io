message: <p>Very cool. I really like the wider layout. It's a lot easier to read.<br>Things are shifting around a bit as they load or as I type comments (FF2). Commonlayout.css seems to have a character encoding issue (begins with ï»¿).<br>I'm taking a crack at horizontal scrollbar issue - I'll let you know if I find anything.</p>
