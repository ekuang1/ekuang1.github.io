message: <p>I like it, but it has some problems. Stop reading this comment at any time if you think I'm nitpicking :)<br>1. The ads are too prominent. I'd place them in the/a sidebar. Those of us with AdBlock also can only see a huge whitespace there.<br>2. The logo is small and ends abruptly (probably to accommodate the ads).<br>3. I'd make the surrounding border a shade of blue instead of black, since it's a bit too bold. It also ends around the 'useful references' section, instead of at the end of the page.</p>
