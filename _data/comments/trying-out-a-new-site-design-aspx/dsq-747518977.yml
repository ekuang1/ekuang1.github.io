message: <p>@Michele and Omer, yeah, I need to figure out a balance with the ads. If I'm going to make any income, they need to be prominent. But if they are too prominent, I know they can be obnoxious. <br>One thought I had was to only show them to people coming from Google searches, <a href="http://Digg.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Digg.com">Digg.com</a>, etc... <br>I need some way to pay for hosting etc and to support the time I spend on writing open source software. Ad revenue could be a big help in that regard.<br>For now, it's helped in that I can continue to work at reduced pay for my own company during the start-up phase.<br>I'll mull this over.</p>
