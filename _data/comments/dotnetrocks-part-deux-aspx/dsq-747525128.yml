message: <p>I listened to your hanselminutes interview, great discussion. The only thing is that it was two short, I would have liked to get a little more discussion as to what things you guys thought were going to be in the release version of the main product and how the MvcContrib project was going to decorate that future version.<br>Great job on getting the community involved. I've never seen any other group in MS be this involved and open.<br>Thanks!</p>
