message: <p>My US government password was something along the lines of two lower case, two upper case, two numbers, and two punctuations, all of which had to be mixed up according to some asinine rules.  Oh, and we had to change it every 3 months.  I have trouble remembering my cellphone number, let alone a quasi-random code. <br><br><br><br>Needless to say, my code was always written down and stored conveniently in my file cabinet under "Computer".  Good thing the US Army doesn't have any secrets they wouldn't want the world to know about.</p>
