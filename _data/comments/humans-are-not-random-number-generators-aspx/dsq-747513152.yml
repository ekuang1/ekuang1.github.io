message: <p>My password generation system has survived every intrusion test into our company. We've had password attacking software run against the SAM database for literally months and it never figured mine or anyone else's who used my methodology out. Yeah, it'd swipe a character or two, but that was about it. Unfortunately, within 15 minutes we had 90% of the entire company's passwords, including the CEO's.<br><br><br><br>When you have a password like Idahg95JWÅ¸, you can rest assured no one is going to be able to either guess or brute force their way in in a timely manner. No, it's not impossible, but the improbability of it would give the Heart of Gold fits. By the way, that stood for I drive a hunter green 95 Jeep Wrangler (with ALT+159 tossed in the end for good measure). Using the first letter of a phrase is easier to type and easier to remember.<br><br><br><br>I'm not saying my system is perfect, I'm saying it is good enough, at least for now.<br><br><br><br>I also did a trick one time (one of those that you can only do once) where I chose a simple word as a password, let the admins 'hack' the db to get it, and challenged them to log in as me. Even with my password right there in front of them, they couldn't log in as me. The secret? A space at the end (it doesn't 'show up' in the report, they never typed it). Not a good security method, but kind of funny nonetheless.<br><br></p>
