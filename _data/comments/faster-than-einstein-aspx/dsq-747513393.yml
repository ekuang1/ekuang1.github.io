message: <p>Magnetic fields and electrostatic fields propagate faster than the speed of light. These fields can be used to send information such as audio and video signals in a similar way as radio waves are used, but these fieds are only that, they are definetely not radio waves. We have proven it with our experiments. Check out the above web site and see for yourself and find out for yourself when you duplicate our experiments. So before you run down our experiments, do them, then if you still feel we are not right, let us know. In the mean time, I won't be holding my breath, because no one has proved us wrong yet. Sure, we had a lot of negative comments, but that is only sour grapes, we had no proof yet.<br>Regards, Adolf Erdmann</p>
