message: <p>yup..a very interesting concept indeed. If you've not already done so, you could look at <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/</a> (PBS had a good show about Einstein on NOVA on the 100 year anniversary of the equation E=Mc^2). There's some good stuff up there.</p>
