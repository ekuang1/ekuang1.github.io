message: <p>Brazil applies reciprocal visa policies to other countries in the world, since the USA ask brasilians for a visa and it's a complicated an lenghty process they also apply the same policy to you, I'm Colombian and our country doesn't ask brasilans for a visa, so they apply the same policy to us, we enter Brazil freely just by showing our passport, no other application required.</p>
