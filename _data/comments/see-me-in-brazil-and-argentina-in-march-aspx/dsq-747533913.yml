message: "<p>Haacked,<br>As others wrote here, don't miss in São Paulo the dishes: feijoada and picanha, and also the drink caipirinha. The city is called by some as \"the unofficial capital of culinary\", so you can enjoy great food. The greatest churrascaria (steakhouse) in town is Fogo de Chão (<a href=\"http://www.fogodechao.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.fogodechao.com/\">http://www.fogodechao.com/</a>), and they are near Microsoft.<br>São Paulo never sleeps, and you can find many places to go by night even at week days. If you want to feel at home a bit, and listen some good and old rock and roll or jazz, go to one of the best pubs in town, O'Malleys (<a href=\"http://www.omalleysbar.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.omalleysbar.net/\">http://www.omalleysbar.net/</a>).<br>Have a great time!</p>"
