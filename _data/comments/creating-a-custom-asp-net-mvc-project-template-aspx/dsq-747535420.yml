message: <p>Even with the limitations, I very much like the ability to reference nuget packages from a vstemplate file.  <br>My project team makes heavy use of project templates; It would be nice if this feature applied to all vstemplate files - appears to be specific to just the MVC3 wizard.<br>Any plans for this feature to migrate into general use?</p>
