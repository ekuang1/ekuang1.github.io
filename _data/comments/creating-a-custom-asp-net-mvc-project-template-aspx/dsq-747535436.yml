message: '<p>Ouch! For images (and probably all other binary files) ReplaceParameters should be false, not true. Apparently, VS errors out trying to find the tokens.<br>OK, in hindsight it is obvious (as everything else in hindsight) :) - but something more verbose than "HRESULT: 0x80041FEB" would be really nice.<br>Hopefully, somebody will stumble upon this solution before tearing his hear out!</p>'
