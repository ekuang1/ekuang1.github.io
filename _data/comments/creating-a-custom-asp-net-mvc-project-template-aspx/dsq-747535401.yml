message: <p>Seconding Pop's comment - it's clearly a hack for now.  Hopefully we can stay aware from putting custom state in the Program Files folder.  That's not what it was designed for.  Visual Studio may put the out-of-box templates there, but that doesn't mean that user-generated content should be there unless they are willing to package it up in an MSI and distribute it properly.</p>
