message: <p>Very cool Phil. Couple requests:<br>- It would be nice if it looked for "Required" in the resource file and just used it it when a more specific translation wasn't provided. As it stands now you can end up with a message that is partially translated "The pr√©nom field is required"<br>-The Pascal/Camel casing feature you mentioned should probably not make changes to all uppercase words (ie. SSN, ID, etc).</p>
