message: <p>Thanks for the update.  The flickering is a problem with how Firefox lays out floating elements (the text floats to the left, the sidebar floats to the right).  The problem doesn't affect IE.<br><br><br><br>I put something in place to reduce the flickering, but apparently I haven't solved it yet.</p>
