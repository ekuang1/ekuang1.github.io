message: <p>After having read Mike Potel and Martin Fowler I thought I had a clear understanding...  Your blog raised some more questions (and laughter - the Difference).   I use to understand the difference to be the "levels of abstraction" (Mike Potel) but more importantly for the reasons you noted in your MVP paragraph.  I further believed that things like Passive View and MVC where for the old world as long as we're using Microsoft controls and databinding.  So I must admit I was somewhat confused when Scott Guthries ASP.NET "MVC" emerged...  <br>The muddied waters are my failure to comprehend how "TWisting the Triad" can be called MVC; the ASP.NET controls still handle the input and its events are processed in their respective presenters.  The ASP.NET controls are smarter than they've ever been (and getting smarter).  <br>Can you see where it is as clear as mud and why your "Difference" was somewhat embarrassing for me as we have an Agile environment and I laughed like a lune during a quite time in a room of developers.<br></p>
