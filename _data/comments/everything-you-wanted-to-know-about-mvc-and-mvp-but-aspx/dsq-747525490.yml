message: <p>@Alex I should be more clear. We don't attempt to emulate the control statefulness of a rich client application by shuttling state back and forth within an opaque ViewState field.<br>You can still write rich client like apps by simply keeping the state for controls within the client, ala Ajax and Javascript.</p>
