message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>First of all I would like to commend you for the article you made comparing MVP and MVC patterns. I have a question though, we are about to build a huge and web long-term web application and we are currently searching for a good <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> pattern and I think MVC is a good candidate for us. My question is, is it safe to implement the MVC framework today even though it is Beta? Thank you very much.<br>Regards,<br>Arnold</p>
