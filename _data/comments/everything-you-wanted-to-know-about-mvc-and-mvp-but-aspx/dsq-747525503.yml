message: "<p>Thanks for the article, Phil.  It's a good primer for some people I work with to get an idea what MVC is all about.<br>Do you know or can you tell me how to find out whether there's a projected date for release for MVC?  I would love to use it here: we have several projects that would benefit from it, but we aren't allowed to use things that aren't officially released.  I have heard rumors that it won't be out till 2010 but I can't find any real information one way or the other.</p>"
