message: <p>Definitely test actual data access code against the database (mocking ADO.Net itself == pain).  I do exactly what you describe in the last paragraph and separate test assemblies for unit and integration testing for convenience.  For non-data access code, I think it's usually more work to test against the database with the database setup overhead than it is to use mock objects.<br><br><br><br>Your client/customer certainly doesn't care about your TDD purity score, so whatever gets you to done is right.</p>
