message: "<p>@Alexandre: I haven't used RazorEngine, but from what I can see, it's quite different, in the sense that it is a runtime library while RazorGenerator is a design time tool. With RazorGenerator, code gets generated and compiled as part of your project, such that at runtime there is no dependency on Razor, and no on-the-fly compilation. See my posts on RazorGenerator (<a href=\"http://blog.davidebbo.com/search/label/Razor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://blog.davidebbo.com/search/label/Razor\">http://blog.davidebbo.com/search/label/Razor</a>) to see examples of what it's good for.</p>"
