message: <p>I tried to add an in-page razor helper in my template with "@helper HelperName(){}" syntax. It looks like the code generated by the Razor Generator is missing some references to System.Web.WebPageExecutingBase for static methods WriteTo and WriteLiteralTo. When I added @using System.Web in the template and prepended these functions with the class name "WebPageExecutingBase." everything worked fine but it gets overwritten if you change the template(obviously).</p>
