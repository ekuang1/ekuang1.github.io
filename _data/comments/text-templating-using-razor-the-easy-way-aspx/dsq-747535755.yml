message: <p>@Josh I think it's pretty extreme to compare this to the Linq2Sql and EF comparisons. <br>T4 is primarily a general purpose text transformation language. Razor is optimized for HTML generation. If you try and generate C# code with Razor, you'll find it's a bit painful. That's not it's sweet spot nor its design intention.<br></p>
