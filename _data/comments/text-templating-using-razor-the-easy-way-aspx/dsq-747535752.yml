message: <p>Thank you for writing this--today i was searching for different template languages to use against xml. I often get "can you use XSLT 2.0" questions about a .NET product we use, and since 1) microsoft hasn't moved to XSLT 2.0 and 2) why would they? Newer template languages like razor/jade/haml have ushered in an era of a much more syntactically friendly form and well... As soon as i hit this "leave your mark" button below this form i'm going to search "xml to dynamic .NET" on google. Thanks phil</p>
