message: '<p>Very handy, but I think you should add a caveat: for those of us building software in SharePoint, this will not currently work (as of 8/1/2011) because SharePoint runs on .NET3.5 and Razor requires the dynamic features of .NET 4.0<br>I once evaluated using Razor in a SharePoint solution and ended up using Castle NVelocity with works just as well for my needs</p>'
