message: <p>As someone who has been on both sides of the equation as both a developer and as a business stakeholder, and having been exposed to both substandard development teams and teams that are the epitomy of excellence, I have the following two cents to add.<br>First, this issue often boils down to the organizations ability to accurately estimate project effort, and the organization's trust in those estimates. Second, this thorougly rests on the amount of due diligence and scoping required. <br>For example, on a past project, we couldn't even determine the size of an effort for a major feature until in one of our sprints, we took several guys and prototyped and dug into the concept of what we wanted to do. However, having spent that effort, we knew, with a reasonable degree of certainty, the size of that effort. Given that size, and some experienced development managers, the team was able to then determine how it was going to apply resources given the constraints of physical well being, work incentives, and time.  There was a date we wanted to hit for business reasons -- but given a reasonable accurate sizing, we could then make tradeoffs versus other features and apply incentives (bonuses for PLANNED overtime, etc) that enabled the team to march forward and hit the date, and deliver high quality code.</p>
