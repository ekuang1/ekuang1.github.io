message: <p>Keep sending - don't stop!!!<br>==<br>Mine and my wife's ID has been stolen a week ago.. the same link-from-body scam. Talked to Yahoo customer (don't) care and got into a vicious circle - can't provide alternate address, because phisher has already changed it... therefore can't get back my account. Asked them to delete my account and they keep asking me for the password. How do I get a new password? By alternate email address, of course! Dumb operators.<br>Talked to a supervisor but she kept asking me the same question - the alternate email address!!! What a stupid situation? Is there a way to TALK to somebody there who has brain? There are so many ways to verify an identity. <br>If I would intend to "steal" somebody's email address, would I call Yahoo's customer service at all?</p>
