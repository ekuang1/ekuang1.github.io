message: <p>- and so i join the esteemed club of those snookered by the geocities phishing scam. my old account is still active, but i cannot access it because, as you all know, the personal information and security questions have been changed by the interloper. - yahoo was indeed useless to me, but it isnt really their fault. - i have pretty much given up on ever getting my old id back, but i am curious; does anyone know who these people are, what they are looking for and 'why' my account would still be active months after being hacked? - (i remain open to suggestions for retrieving my old id.) - good luck to all sabatoged. <br> - die phisher scum.</p>
