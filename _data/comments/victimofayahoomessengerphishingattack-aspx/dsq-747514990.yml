message: <p>I clicked on a link from a friend, and it said yahoo pictures so stupid me put in my yahoo name and password and someone hijacked my account. I know some of my friends on messenger got the link from me but I didn't send it. I guess it sent after I clicked it and they lost their yahoo accounts too. If you did have this happen you need to email yahoo at this email addres. <br>account-security-help@cc.yahoo<a href="http://-inc.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="-inc.com">-inc.com</a> <br>I got this email from the support guy at yahoo. The phone number there is 1-866-562-7219. It took me forever to find this number so write it down for safe keeping. If you email them about your account being stolen, in the subject just type your yahoo id and then in the body explain what happened. They will email you back an auto response and you fill it in and email it back.  I guess I forgot my security question or something and they emailed me back and told me to fax them my state id.  I did this and a few days later they emailed me and I had my account back.  It took me about a week to get this done.  Hope this helps anyone out there.</p>
