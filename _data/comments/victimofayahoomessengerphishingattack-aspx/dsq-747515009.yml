message: <p>My turn.<br>As of this morning, 11/06/06 I lost the ability to sign into my Yahoo messenger and e-mail .<br>About three or four weeks ago, someone on my Yahoo messenger sent me and instant message, saying to check out a profile on geocities. I assumed it was a friend of hers.<br>I clicked on the link. What appeared as a geocities sign in page appeared. I put in my username and password. I got the response "web site busy, check back later".<br>I wrote customer care this morning because I can't remember all my original info since i moved several times.<br>Told them to either cancel the account completely or help me with a new password.<br>Oh well.</p>
