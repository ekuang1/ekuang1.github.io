message: <p>I haven't a clue how or when my yahoo id was stolen.  I didn't check it all that often.  But when I went to do my check in it told me my password was wrong. So I wasn't sure if they had sut down my email address or not.  So I sent a few emails to my old address and they went through which tells me my old address is still up and running.  I've been in contact with Yahoo for awhile now and nothing concrete yet.</p>
