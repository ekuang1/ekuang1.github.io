message: <p>The latest scam is to send links to Geocities sites that appear to have amusing or sexual content, i.e. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/blondybabe_45325" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.geocities.com/blondybabe_45325">www.geocities.com/blondybab...</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/spermbank_sarah" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.geocities.com/spermbank_sarah">www.geocities.com/spermbank...</a>, and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/eat_my_cherry_pie10" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.geocities.com/eat_my_cherry_pie10">www.geocities.com/eat_my_ch...</a>.  After being tricked into logging on, you are either directed to a Geocities web site that has the type of content you expect, or else the "build your own website" generic Geocities page.<br>I did not ever lose control of my account, the hijacker seemed to only use my IM to send out more links to other users.  But I do not use Yahoo! Wallet (for precisely this reason) and use this account only for social email and chat - so there was not really anything else useful the hackers could get from me besides a possible way into more profitable accounts.<br></p>
