message: <p>someone got into my yahoo account and changed my account info and password so i couldn't recover my password or anything.<br>I emailed yahoo constantly but never got anywhere as they kept asking for account info which the hacker had changed.<br>Eventually I phone yahoo customer services in the UK (0870 3522000). They asked me for my brithdate and then got me to give them a list of people's addresses in my address book to confirm it was catually my account.<br>I've now got my account back!</p>
