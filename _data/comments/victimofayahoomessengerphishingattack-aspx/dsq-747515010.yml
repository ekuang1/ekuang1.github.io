message: "<p>From a friend of mine, a heartwarming tail xD<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>Just wanted to let you know, I almost fell victim to the same thing. A friend of mine who had a certain sense of humor had her account hijacked, and sent me a message in much the same fashion. Timeline:<br>1. Attempted login at the phishing site the first time, used wrong password.<br>2. Wondered why I didn't get logged in. Tried again with real password.<br>3. Now really wondered why I didn't get logged in. Then recalled that the form data sent the stuff to some third party site, and that Yahoo Photos wasn't on Geocities.<br>4. Hit back, viewed source code of page, noticed form was being sent to third party unsecure mailer cgi. Resent username and password, with password as \"Fuck you\".<br>5. Found password changer on yahoo site, changed password twice, just in case a bot was able to login and survive one password change. (You never know)<br>6. Thirty minutes later, sent off 20,000 faulty username/password combinations through same mailer to the gmail account of the phisher.<br>7. Switched to random interval mailings of the same thing, so that they blend in with stolen real username/password combinations. (To date: several days)<br>8. As a result, received buddy list request from someone named \"Fucking_stop_emailing\"<br>Just wanted to share with you all</p>"
