message: <p>I got victimized by this phising this morning when I carelessly clicked on a link on an offline message from a relative (there are more than 10 of them listed). When an empty IE window opened I immediately remebered about this scam and I opened another IE window to log in to my yahoo Inbox and lo! I got the wrong password error three times I tried. Got back to IM immediately, clicked on the email icon below for my Inbox, a prompt that asked if I want to log automatically came up, I chosed yes and then I got to my Inbox with relief and immediately changed my password, saved!!!<br></p>
