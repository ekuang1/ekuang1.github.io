message: <p>Just had a similar (lucky) escape. Received an IM from a buddy, who's obviously fallen for this phish to "visit this really cool site" clicked on the link:<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/nkygirlie/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.geocities.com/nkygirlie/">http://www.geocities.com/nk...</a><br>and was shown a geocities 360 beta log in page. Logged in and sussed it straight away and changed my password immediately. I almost got suckered though because it was from someone I knew.</p>
