Then I figured I got tricked. One of my friends who got the link suggested me to change my password. Maybe the hackers are trying to get credit information or such from our accounts. Who knows, I changed the password immediately. I am not sure if they will be able to continue what they intended. I am sorry for the friends who got the link from my account... Hope nobody gets tricked.</p>
