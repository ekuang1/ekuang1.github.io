message: "<p>A follow up report. I called Yahoo customer service yesterday morning. Surprisingly, I had very little problem getting through.<br>Long story short: The only thing Yahoo can do for you is what you can already do for yourself.<br>If you click on the LOST PASSWORD link, there is a form to enter your date of birth, zip code, username.<br>Now, supposedly, it's supposed to be based on your ORIGINAL zip code when you first signed up. This says to me that even if the hacker changed the zip code after stealing the account, Yahoo's database should have a record of the original zip code on file.<br>Unfortunately, I cannot backtrack far enough to figure out which zip code it was. So again, they can't help me.<br>So once again: The only thing Yahoo can do for you is what you can already do for yourself. They are basically no help at all.<br>Fortunately (like Scott St above 09/19/06) I only used the account for anonymous social networking and chat. No credit cards were associated with the account.<br>Obviously the hackers are using the account to send out the false geocities sign in pages to more people; but to what end?<br>KEEP POSTING PEOPLE...THIS IS A HOT TOPIC<br><br></p>"
