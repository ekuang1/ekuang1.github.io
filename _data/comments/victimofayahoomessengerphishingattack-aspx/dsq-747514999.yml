message: <p>hi all, i just got phished sunday morning after clicking on a link saying that i would find my pictures being used there. well, low and behold i couldnt enter my account after being kicked off of it. it keeps saying invalid. i emailed yahoo several times and i even called customer care in which they referred me to this email in which i send them all my original registration information.<br>now im waiting for a response from the email in hopes of getting my yahoo account back. how can i remember the secret question if when i request my password, my zip code was changed? this is a job in itself!! the information provided on this sited is pretty useful, thanks alot guys. and good luck to all in pursuit of getting your accounts back.</p>
