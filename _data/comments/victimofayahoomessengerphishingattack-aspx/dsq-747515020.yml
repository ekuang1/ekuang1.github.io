message: "<p>EITHER:<br>1. Call Yahoo customer service - 1-866-562-7219<br>OR: <br>2. Or click on the link on the e-mail log on page, \"Forgot your ID or Password?\", and fill out the info: Birthdate, Zip Code, Country, letter from the security image, and your Yahoo ID. If this information matches the info in Yahoo's database, the next screen will be a security question that you orginally used like favorite pet or mother's maiden name(you probably forgot you ever did that).<br>As was mentioned earlier, when I regained control of my account, I went straight to the e-mail where I had about 150 unopened e-mails. Nothing was tampered with. It's almost as if the goal of this Phishing scam is not to get personal information but to cause inconvenience.<br>I highly, highly, doubt that this is one \"dude\" using the same password. This is something that's replicating itself to happen to so many users.<br></p>"
