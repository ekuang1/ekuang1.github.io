message: <p>I too fell for this scam. I thought, gee, I guess 'profile-surfers' got tired of me blocking them and reporting them as spam and they finally reported me. I too go to the 'yahoo website' and put in my info and BAM, there it all went wrong.<br>Anyway, all of you know what happened after that. I emailed Yahoo on Monday morning around 9 a.m. I got an email telling me how to change my password. I told them I already did that. They emailed me and asked for my secret answer. I told them that since I started this ID 10 years ago, I can't remember what the question was! I got another email telling me how to change my password. This went on for 3 days or so. On Friday A.M., I got another email telling me what my Security Question was, so I emailed back the answer. FINALLY, Friday afternoon around 4, my password was changed back and MY YAHOO IS BACK!!!!<br>So, the moral of this story? PERSISTANCE PAYS OFF!!!! Good luck for everyone who is still trying to get their ID back!</p>
