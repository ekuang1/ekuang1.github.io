message: <p>I too have recently received an IM suggesting there were new photos at a geocities site from one of my Yahoo! Messenger friends.  Not really thinking about it, I clicked.  I have my settings so that I am always already signed into Yahoo! sites when I click from a messenger window so was never asked for my ID and password...I simply was brought to an error page.  I sent an offline to my friend saying I wasn't able to see her pictures and she eventually IMed back saying she never sent that IM to me.  :o Yikes!  Well, I don't believe I have at any point so far lost control of my Yahoo! account, but as a precaution, I did change my password.</p>
