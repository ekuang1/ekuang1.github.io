message: <p>I was also a victim of this incredible prank. <br>My screen name was used to IM to all my friends and family, including my 13 yr old niece.<br>I was really upset, thanks to the Lord she was not able to enter the site.<br>It is unreal that Yahoo can't do nothing to help us in this matter. <br>I talked to Latoya, a Yahoo customer rep., and she said the only thing I could do was change my password weekly. By doing that it would be more difficult to the jacker to get access to my account or any other account.<br>And today, it was confirmed when a friend emailed me to tell me that she also got jacked. <br>If you see an IM from me or anyone with the link <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ladivabev/photos_pics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.geocities.com/ladivabev/photos_pics.html">http://www.geocities.com/la...</a> (or rather any geocities link) DO NOT CLICK ON IT.</p>
