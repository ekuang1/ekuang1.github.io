message: <p>I did the same thing and went to a geocities site sent to me from someone on my buddy list. I copied and pasted the link into my browser and it stole my password. When I signed up with that yahoo account I used false informatio that I didnt write down. Yahoo customer service is worthless. I have been trying to learn how to hack just to get my own email account back.</p>
