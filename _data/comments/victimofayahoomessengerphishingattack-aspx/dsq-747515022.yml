message: <p>I just got off the phone with Chester at Yahoo! customer care and he took care of the problem. I am now able to access my account!<br>I have changed my password, and will probably change it at least weekly. <br>Probably the best time to call the folks is around 3pm pacific time. I called at around 5:48 pm eastern time.<br>I hope this gives someone hope!!<br>C.</p>
