message: <p>SUCCESS!<br>I managed to "hack" my way back in this morning.<br>I am laughing at myself for putting in information that was so misleading even I couldn't remember it. (I didn't want my exact birthday since someone could combine that with some other account information). I had to guess what I was thinking at the time.<br>My suggestion is this:<br>Click on "Forget your ID or Password"<br>Write down every zip code you've lived at since you created that Yahoo username.<br>Put in your birthday and username<br>When you get that much it gives you a security question you put in. After that it gives you a new password to use on the screen.<br>Some things to note:<br>The hacker didn't open a single e-mail. They were all unread. Even the e-mail confirming the hacker's password change was unread. I can't figure out the purpose of this "scam" if you can even call it that.<br>The hacker didn't go into any of the Yahoo services I was using, like Photos or Groups, for instance.<br>What a sigh of relief that i got control of my account back.<br>Good luck!<br></p>
