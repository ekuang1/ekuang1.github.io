message: "<p>On August 18, 2006 I became a victim of a phishing scam through my yahoo messenger. I have call yahoo at there customer support # which is 866 562 7219 which I just get  referred back to emailing yahoo security which is<br> account-security-help@cc.yahoo<a href=\"http://-inc.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"-inc.com\">-inc.com</a><br>which I have sent over 30 emails asking for help. The sad thing of this matter is the hacker change all aspects of my account information, my zip code don't match what yahoo has on record now. The secret question they ask for I don't recall. So to make a long story short I loss pictures I had stored of my children, family, friends and several contacts that I only had stored there. Yahoo has been NO help at all to me. So I guess the phishing hacker won this battle with the help of yahoo customer service if any one reads this with a similar experience that finally got there account back please let me know I'll be back checking this site... Thanks for letting me Vent...Steve</p>"
