message: <p>You know the story better than most Phil :) it has little to do with qualitative reasoning &amp; more to do with fear / compete paranoia.</p><p>If we give stuff away for free without being able to face a "business review" in  the executive building whilst not coming up with a monetization strategy it simply ends abruptly before it starts.</p><p>Every aspect of Microsoft has to have "pull through" and it really comes back to creative accounting to show a money trail for why the company should invest in a team of engineers to write code for free - even though with the amount of cashflow in reserve it would probably take 2-3 years for the company to start noticing a negative loss should they actually shut down the company (given how much revenue is squirrelled away).</p><p>I like Guthrie, he's always managed to find a way to navigate the "monetization" mess and when we had Silverlight / WPF on the books we also faced such questions as to why should the DLR be made, why should the plugin work on Mac, why should we expand our borders further and further... all it came down to was us spinning a lot of crap to get past the executive branch and tell them lies like "Oh it will mean X% pull through on SQL / IIS server licenses which translates further into Windows etc etc" basically creative accounting.</p><p>Developers never came up in conversation, as for them they just assume the 10million+ .NET developers that purchase MSDN subscriptions that get baked into Enterprise Agreements "automatically" just happens despite in 2008-2009 the data showed there was around 4-5% drop-off in .NET developer numbers due to failures in seeding Academia etc given Universities stopped pushing Microsoft C# as part of the class criteria and doubled down into PHP/LAMP world given the cost was ....free..... and that is the punchline to this sad joke because from that point onwards Bill's IIS team were told to drive Server-share further and wider from not just ISP adoption but also get PHP devs back on side... the irony of how free cost the company so much.</p><p>Imho this is why Scott Guthrie should be Chief Architect or whatever. At least he has a strategy and has shown he can execute whilst not alienating the developer horde...</p>
