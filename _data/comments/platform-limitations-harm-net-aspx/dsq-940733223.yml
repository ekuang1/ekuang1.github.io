message: "<p>\"And that pays the rent how exactly?\"</p><p>How does the BCL, or .NET in general, pay the rent now? I suspect it doesn't - and doesn't need to, directly.</p><p>It's an awesome piece of software, used to make awesome software, but it's power is in what it creates and enables, not the BCL itself.</p><p>I write C# code on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac and Linux. Decisions I've made over the past 10 years of using .NET have directed maybe 10-100x my cumulative salary to Microsoft. Not a large number in the global-enterprise stakes, but I'm just one developer. So, indirectly, my decision to stick with C# DOES pay the rent in Redmond - and the however-many-million+ developers like me.</p><p>and Richard is from Ranui! Awesome, bro! ;-) #kiwi</p>"
