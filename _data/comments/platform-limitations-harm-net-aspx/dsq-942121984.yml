message: <p>How does making any development platform/tool/lib cross-platform "pay the rent" for MS?</p><p>Fairly simple in my case; if it isn't cross-platform then most of my clients will not want it. If my clients don't want it, I don't want it. If I don't want it, I don't buy the tool/lib (or if it is free, use it) and I don't use it in development or distribute it or any of the nice downstream things that eventually lead to "paying the rent" for MS - I use something else.</p><p>This is why Java and OSS continue to eat MS's lunch.</p><p>Until MS comes to grips with this, they will continue to be a bit player in the server, cross-platform and phone/tablet world and continue to lose market share (albeit slowly) on the desktop.</p>
