message: <p>Its not simple as you have a general ledger and until you can attach a product teams effort to that ledger you're in this DMZ that's filled with "potential vs reality" ... yes you have the potential to have strong pull through but in reality sales figures aren't spiking... so now comes a culling exercise when the $$ dont stack in your favor.</p><p>Getting rid of something because its popular isn't something they are worried about, as to them this is a long-game not a short game. Microsoft doesn't think in terms of "how can i grow current dev sat levels up by 20% this fiscal year" ... they think often "how can i drive student adoption so in 10 years they are addicted to me.." which is the long game.</p><p>OSS only serves a purpose in around making newcomers to the development fold adopt their technology or at times tick a box that shows you are great community citizens but only if it funnels into a tool or platform strategy in play.</p><p>For instance anything ASP.NET related being "Free" isn't actually free, as in reality the % of adoption around ASP.NET are likely to be investments in Windows so the obvious win there is simply "Windows pull through" given im yet to see any offerings out there that gives you a Linux Box running ASP.NET.</p><p>Java doesn't eat MS's lunch its actually quite a close call and the only reason why Java numbers picked up in the last 3 years is due to Android development which the irony there is because Microsoft decided again developer sat levels *currently* aren't important thus resetting the entire WPF/SL stack with no transition plan whilst at the same time trying to increase SL adoption through Wp7 but at the same time saying SL is effectively dead... so any lead they had on Mobility was destroyed and replaced with iOS/Android development  etc.</p><p>Anyway, there are so many cascade of failures but in the end the mindset of those in charge inside Microsoft aren't thinking about "How do i make you all happy" ...there's only a handful at the executive level that get it and as Phil etc know one of them is Scott Guthrie as the reason he gets it is because he has no issue getting on a plane and visiting .NET devs etc (his audience) where they live, listens to their feedback and executes on it.</p>
