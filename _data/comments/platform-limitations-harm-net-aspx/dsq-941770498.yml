message: <p>&gt; You know the story better than most Phil :) it has little to do with qualitative reasoning &amp; more to do with fear / compete paranoia.</p><p>True. But I also know that sometimes an outside influence can help get the ball rolling faster. It's another thing to "fear". Miguel was very successful with helping the MEF team have the firepower to make a strong case to remove the limitation.</p><p>I'm hoping the strong reaction this post has received does the same. It should be clear to any bean counter that this is important to their customers.</p><p>As for Guthrie as Chief Architect, that's a good start! I'm not sure he wants the job, but I'm rooting for him as a future CEO. ;)</p>
