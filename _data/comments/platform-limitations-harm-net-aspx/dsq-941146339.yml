message: <p>I think the tweet you got back is misleading.</p><p>In my recent experience, the more likely reason for the limitation is ms legal. I've recently - for 3 months - been trying to get the same platform limitation removed from the kona/prism sample projects on codeplex. The blocking point here seems to be Microsoft legal teams - the technical teams seem genuinely keen to help, but the legal team requires a very thorough review over the code and ip included.</p><p>I guess that there are genuine legal issues here - I guess ms really do have some patent licenses which mean that they need to check what they release where.</p><p>However, I too hope that the situation changes in the near future :)</p>
