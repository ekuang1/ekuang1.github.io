message: <p>I think the issue is that this is being looked at from the wrong perspective, and the question isn't really about open source.  If Microsoft thinks limiting choice and forcing developers or users to do things actually makes the developers and users happy and loyal they are severely mistaken.  People like options and choice, not the other way around.</p><p>Lets say for example the Xbox team comes out with a restriction that any game put out on Xbox has to be exclusive, across the board EA or Activision or whoever included. They cannot release on PS3 or PS4 or PC or iOS or Android or whatever, only on Xbox, or not be on Xbox at all.  Now can anyone honestly say that would be something the game developers and companies would go along with and that Xbox would automatically win with that approach?  Of course not, they would quickly disappear as all they would have is the few first party games and virtually no sales from lack of titles as well as bad press and as a result and quickly be left in the dust.  The game developers, especially smaller ones, don't really care about the success of microsoft, or sony, or apple, or any of the companies directly, what they care about is having a platform on which to provide their game and make sales.  Being on more platforms means more users and theoretically more sales, so they have no real reason to limit themselves and thus why most games are cross platform that aren't first party or paid exclusives (where the payment makes up for the lost revenue of not being cross platform).  The companies/developers also will want to support any platform where they can easily do so without a big investment and think they can make sales, because that is just a bigger usersbase, so if there aren't restrictions they will come to you.</p><p>So now apply that same reasoning to what Microsoft is trying to do with Windows Phone and Windows 8 and licenses such as this.  Do they really think that limiting developers to only windows phone is going to magically make windows phone win and make developers happy, especially given the huge lead in market share that iOS and Android have?  Well newsflash it isn't, its far too late in the game to try that.  What they should instead concentrate on is being the best development platform across all options, Windows, iOS, Android, etc.  If C# was the development language of choice, then you would have people who create an app for iOS or Android because of their market share, and then can put it out on Windows Phone essentially for free because of C# and expand their market and potential userbase.  That is a free win for Windows Store as it gets apps there that might not have otherwise been there, and having C# be ubiquitous would hardly make them lose any apps.  So something like that can drive revenue simply by the cut of money from sales on the Windows Store, as well as people using the best C# development environment in Visual Studio.  It also lets adopters of Windows Phone have more apps available on the store and not have to worry that by picking the phone with the best features and platform, which is what the phones should be competing on, they have to give up their favorite apps.</p><p>It is also drives positive brand recognition and positive word of mouth, instead of people complaining and saying I would use C# but can't because it only supports Windows, whether via licensing or whatever, and so I am using Ruby or Java or Objective-C or only developing for the current top mobile platforms, they could instead say I am using C# and it is great and expands the reach of my app to all the platforms.  They can start looking at and talking about Microsoft as the company that allowed them to become successful and be looked at in a positive way instead of always being associated with limitations and vendor lock-in.  If Windows Phone wants to have a chance this late in the party it should be by providing the best phones with the best features and platform, not by trying to lock down developers to developing only on Windows.  The climate has changed and in the long run they are going to lose that battle.</p>
