message: <p>The math that most companies do is to figure out what the cost of acquiring developers and the long-term value that each one of these guys bring to the platform.</p><p>For example, if bringing a developer to the Windows platform costs 500 dollars, but in the long term it brings 6,000 dollars worth of sales, you have a net gain of 5,400 dollars.</p><p>I get the feeling that ultra-successful companies like Microsoft do not have to do this math anymore since they are just so used to people adopting their platform by default.</p><p>The arrival of the Web, Android and iOS worlds have started to turn this around. For the first time in Microsoft's history there are major platforms that Microsoft no longer controls and have created their own ecosystems.</p><p>The platform limitations are a reminder of the philosophy of protecting Windows over anything else, but it does not take into consideration that (a) existing .NET developers are abandoning the platform for Ruby, Python, JS on the Web and Java and Objective-C on mobile and (b) that once they go, the price to get them back the math of the long-term value to the platform shifts from Microsoft to someone else.</p><p>Microsoft seems to be oblivious to the fact that every developer they loose to Android and Objective-C is a developer that will be very hard to bring back. And every roadblock they put that slows down .NET on other platforms is undermining their own long-term goals.</p><p>Microsoft seems to be planning only their next move, unable to play chess.</p>
