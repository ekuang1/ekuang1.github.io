message: <p>Microsoft have been long time supporters of Xamarin (MS was a major sponsor of Xamarin's Evolve 2013 conference), so the platform limitation in the EULA makes no sense in that it excludes Xamarin customers.  As you state, it most likely left over from a license template, and Richard's "rent" response is simply a knee-jerk reaction without looking at the wider picture.</p>
