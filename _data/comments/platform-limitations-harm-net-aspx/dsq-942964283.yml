message: <p>What MS does and why they do it doesn't really matter to me.</p><p>What matters to me is what *I* do and why *I* do it. Over 15 years ago I made the break away from the MS monoculture and proprietary tools and went the Java and OSS route.</p><p>The major reasons were:</p><p>1) WORA - or something approaching that (I understand that the idea of WORA can at times be more of a goal than a destination - but even if I only get 90% there it makes my life and work a lot simpler - I can concentrate on *what* I want to do instead of the *how*). This made my life a lot simpler and widened my target audience, whether the "audience" is an end-user or an employer or client.</p><p>2) I got rather tired of MS changing their collective minds every few years about what the newest programming API/SDK/lib or OS was to be. Everytime that happened I needed to stop, learn the latest fad/API/SDK/OS (sometimes all of the above at the same time) so that I could be current and marketable.</p><p>If MS wants developer mindshare, and that seems to be what the original article is about, then they have to get inside the head of the developers and look at it from our perspective.</p><p>If MS *doesn't* want that mindshare, or they feel it is a lesser asset in their ledger/strategy/whatever than their ability to "pull through" something so they can sell more copies of Windows or other MS products - then that is MS's issue/worry/strategy - not mine. I am not going to adjust my tasks/career/interests to align with their strategy as that is not my goal.</p><p>FWIW, I do both Java and .NET development (about 95/5% division). I do .NET development because my current client (one of the largest corps in the world) for some reason drank a sip of MS Koolaid when it comes to web services and started off with VB6 for those services (they have been ported to C#).</p><p>I like some features of C# over those of Java, and if I were tasked to do dev work that would only ever and forever run on Windows, and needed tight integration with Windows, then I would probably go with .NET. Interestingly, for my current client, I think they would be better served with Java on their servers and .NET desktop apps - but for some strange reason they do it the other way around (Java Swing on the desktop and .NET on the server).</p><p>I like to think of myself as platform/language agnostic - using the tools that make the most sense for the job at hand. Trying to foresee the future, I still see the JVM platform (whether it uses Java, Scala, or some other JVM language) dominating the server market, and either dominating or having a very large share of the mobile market. For UI clients I see web or RIA clients dominating, especially in the world of enterprise client apps - I don't see .NET dominating there and I do see Java having a very large role to play in that market.</p><p>In short, IMO, MS is limiting the appeal of the .NET dev platform by restricting it to Windows targets. This in turn limits Windows adoption, although not directly. As I said, MS is losing market share in both the platform and developer (mindshare) worlds. If MS is interested in the long term health of MS and wanting to keep MS relevant, then MS needs to turn around some of their thinking on this issue. No longer will most orgs accept vendor lock in - the market is getting more sophisticated and it sees that for what it is. MS will have to evolve or die.</p>
