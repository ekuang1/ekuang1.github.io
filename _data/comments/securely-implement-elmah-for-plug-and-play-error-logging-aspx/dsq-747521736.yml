message: <p>Prior to reading this blog post I had been using ELMAH, however had not secured ELMAH....now I am.  However, I found that I had to secure ELMAH by specifying the following...<br>  &lt;location path="ELMAH"&gt;<br>    &lt;system.web&gt;<br>      &lt;authorization&gt;<br>        &lt;allow roles="Admin"/&gt;<br>        &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;<br>      &lt;/authorization&gt;<br>    &lt;/system.web&gt;<br>  &lt;/location&gt;<br><br>I expected the following specification to also work, however it would NOT work...<br>  &lt;location path="ELMAH/ErrorLog.axd"&gt;<br>    &lt;system.web&gt;<br>      &lt;authorization&gt;<br>        &lt;allow roles="Admin"/&gt;<br>        &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;<br>      &lt;/authorization&gt;<br>    &lt;/system.web&gt;<br>  &lt;/location&gt;<br><br>In both cases my Http Handler specifications were specified as follows...<br>&lt;httpHandlers&gt;<br>  &lt;add verb="POST,GET,HEAD"<br>    path="ELMAH/ErrorLog.axd"<br>    type="GotDotNet.Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, GotDotNet.Elmah, Version=2.0.50727.42, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89e7ba9b9c08cfca"<br>&lt;/httpHandlers&gt;<br>Any thoughts you may have on why the path="ELMAH/ErrorLog.axd" is NOT working is appreciated.<br>Cheers...</p>
