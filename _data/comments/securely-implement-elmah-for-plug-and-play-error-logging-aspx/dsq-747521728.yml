message: <p>YES!  Thank you for the simple explanation.  we've been using elmah for awhile and the devs insisted that there was no way to secure it.  needless to say I was not happy about having it up on production unsecured.  Now it's secured and I can go back to being paranoid about other things...<br>;)</p>
