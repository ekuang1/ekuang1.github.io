message: <p>@Ivan - Take a look at the steps to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998306.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="How to Use Health Monitoring">setup health monitoring</a>. I'll patiently wait here while you read through all of that.<br>What's missing with Health Monitoring? Where's the UI to get at the events?<br>There's nothing <em>wrong</em> with health monitoring, but I see it as <em>instrumentation</em>. It's great when you have the time to spend creating and raising various health events in your code. <br>ELMAH serves a different purpose in my view. It's meant to be a <em>quick</em> pluggable way to log unhandled exceptions. It's not about instrumentation (though I think it can be used that way if you want).<br>With just a little configuration, and in most cases without any code changes, ELMAH not only handles the capture and logging of unhandled exceptions but also provides a nice UI for viewing exceptions. It's great when you need to quickly add exception logging to an existing app.<br>It doesn't necessarily replace Log4Net, NLog, Health Monitoring logging, but can be a complement.</p>
