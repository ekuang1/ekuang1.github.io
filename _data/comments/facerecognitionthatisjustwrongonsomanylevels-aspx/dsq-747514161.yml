message: <p>Hah sorry dude but you do kinda look like Kim Jong Il anyways, even if you didn't have the glasses... at least in that picture :p<br>I think if your head hadn't been tilted back there wouldn't be much of a resemblance though, the thing just measures distances and basic shapes, like the sweep of the eyebrows and whatnot...<br>I got Linda Carter from one picture, and Moby from another lol</p>
