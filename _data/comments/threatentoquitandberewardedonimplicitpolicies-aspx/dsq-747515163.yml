message: <p>It's sadder when <i>threatening</i> to quit doesn't do the trick. I've been in this business for more than ten years and, mark my words, I've <b>never</b>, received a salary raise worth the name. Not once.<br>The only way to raise your salary in this field in my country seems to be to switch jobs. Of the five or so times I've changed jobs I've only received counteroffers two times, and both of them were laughable. It's really sad.</p>
