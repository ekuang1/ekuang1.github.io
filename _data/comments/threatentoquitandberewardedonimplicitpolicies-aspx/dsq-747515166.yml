message: <p>The workplace I am leaving is a clear example of a "dysfunctional work environment that is incapable of valuing employees and paying them what they are worth".<br>I just put in my notice and my boss offered me more money. Funny thing is, I complained about my paltry raise and he offered nothing.  All the while telling me the product I was working on was the future of the company.<br>You should really never accept a counter offer for a number of reasons - <br>1. they previously showed they won't pay employees their true worth and you can bet your next "raise" will be below standard to put you back in line with their low valuation.<br>2. they know you were out looking and will probably not trust you as a result. You can't go date another woman and expect your girlfriend or wife to treat you the same if you decide to come back.<br></p>
