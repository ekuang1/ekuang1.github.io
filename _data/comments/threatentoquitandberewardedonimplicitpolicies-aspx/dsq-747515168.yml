message: <p>probably because you were not worth it, however your new employer enjoyed your interviewing (bs) skills.  Now that they were 'stuck' with you, you probably did enough not to get fired, but certainly not enough to get a raise.<br>In my experience, I get raises, even if the company is strictly not giving them.  Mostly because I moved 'up' which allowed for the raise as it came with the position. <br>Take on more responsibility, do a good or excellent job at what you do, and it will happen.  If not, then your job sucks and you should find another one.  Smaller companies that are clueless usually suck to work for because they dont have many comparatives to work with to gauge performance and, usually the managers are, at best, managers and not technical enough to know your aptitude.<br></p>
