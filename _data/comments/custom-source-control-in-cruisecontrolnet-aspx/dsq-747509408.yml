message: <p>For future Googlers:<br>I just did this. Implementation is the same as for builder plugins.  Create a ccnet.yoursccplugin.dll containing a class modeled after one of the built-in source control providers, stick the DLL  in the server directory, modify your config file, and away you go.</p>
