message: <p>I'd say you've accomplished your mission then sir.  You forgot to mention Jimmy Van M; I'm sure you're aware of just how much of a kickass DJ he is as well, and no doubt he and Digweed will do some tag team action as they're on the same stage (the "flower" stage?...lmfao)...definitely to be envied.  I've seen them both, but never together.<br><br><br><br>Black Eyed Peas are amazing live...I caught them a while back over here; they're hilarious and have tons of energy/stage presence.<br><br><br><br>You kids stay out of trouble, and don't do anything I wouldn't do!</p>
