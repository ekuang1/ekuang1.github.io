message: <p>More complexity isn't always a bad thing if some of that complexity is automatically handled for you and helps you manage the complexity better.<br>Consider that MVC is more complicated that simply throwing a bunch of code together into a single component in the simplest way that works.<br>But MVC helps decompose and manage complexity at the cost of adding a slight bit of complexity.</p>
