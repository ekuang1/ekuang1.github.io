message: <p>Hmm, well, I think unit-tests kick ass when it comes to reducing code complexity - and I really don't care how, "Managing complexity," is interpreted (even if it's interpreted correctly).<br>I would point out, however, that unit-testing - fabulous though it is - should not go head-to-head with the mathematically proven (though for a tiny family of systems) benefits of encapsulation, for the latter of which see the following link (or for the instant-gratifiers, see the following+1 link, which shows how a type of complexity is minimised with respect to encapsulation):<br><a href="http://www.edmundkirwan.com/encap/intro.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.edmundkirwan.com/encap/intro.html">http://www.edmundkirwan.com...</a> <br><a href="http://www.edmundkirwan.com/encap/page5.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.edmundkirwan.com/encap/page5.html">http://www.edmundkirwan.com...</a> <br>In other words, practicals and theory are powerful tools used in combination.<br>Ed Kirwan</p>
