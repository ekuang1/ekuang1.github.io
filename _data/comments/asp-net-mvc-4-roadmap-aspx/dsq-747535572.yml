message: <p>Thanks for the info Phil!<br>I noticed one of the images were broken:<br><a href="http://aspwiki/GetFile.aspx?File=/MVC4_Dialogs/viewOptions.PNG" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://aspwiki/GetFile.aspx?File=/MVC4_Dialogs/viewOptions.PNG">aspwiki/GetFile.aspx</a><br>One recipe that would be nice would be a default simple membership provider that's nicely integrated with Code First EF.  That would cut some of the friction of creating logins/roles and would better integrate with other models.<br>I wrote an article on one way to do it with an existing simple membership provider that's on Nuget.<br><a href="http://www.culbertsonexchange.com/wp/?p=120" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.culbertsonexchange.com/wp/?p=120">http://www.culbertsonexchange.com/wp/?p=120</a><br>Thanks,<br>James</p>
