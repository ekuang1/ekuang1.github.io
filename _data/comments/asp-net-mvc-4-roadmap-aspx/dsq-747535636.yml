message: <p>Glad you asked!<br>Client Dependency Framework, YUI, Google Closure tools, ASP.NET Ajax ScriptManager, Chirpy (which is really awesome as it combines all sorts of options in a smart way and it should make you happy as it builds on tooling in VS) and there are probably lots more.<br>But if you need to ask me AND you want to use tools from the community, perhaps it's better to start a poll to see what everyone is using?</p>
