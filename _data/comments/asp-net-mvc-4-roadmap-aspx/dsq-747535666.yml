message: <p>While I think a lot of this is very interesting, I will agree that the emphasis on tooling is making me nervous. Part of what made MVC feel so powerful is that I didn't have to drag and drop. I didn't have to think about Visual Studio, it was just there to give me a hand. <br>When you bind so much to the tools, you begin to let them become the workers. I am a programmer because I know how to use the tools, not because the tools exist. <br>I agree with several of the sentiments on the Reddit page, but I do think people are proclaiming a bit too much doom and gloom. They're only adding stuff that many of us don't want, not yet taking away things that we need.</p>
