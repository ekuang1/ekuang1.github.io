message: <p>Phil, sorry about that.  What I should have said is that the current convention in using types defined in the App_Start folder with the explicit registration of the "Start" method with WebActivator.PreApplicationStartMethod seems a bit afterthought-ish.<br>Also, while I'm at it, another cool feature would be to allow Razor partials to access Sections defined in their parent views.  For example, maybe a partial wants to define some javascript or css yet not have it rendered inline with its markup.</p>
