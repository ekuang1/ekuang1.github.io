message: <p>Wow! Thanks for all the feedback. I'll do my best to respond.<br>@Dan You can do that today.<br>@Stephen well the convention for naming the files doesn't do anything other than provide a nice way of organizing them. What matters is the attribute on the method.<br>@Mike, what bundling/compression frameworks out there would you like to see us use? Note that many of the items I listed aren't going to be built by the MVC team. We just want to integrate such features "in the box".<br>@Brian have you looked at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davidebb/archive/2010/10/11/light-up-your-nupacks-with-startup-code-and-webactivator.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davidebb/archive/2010/10/11/light-up-your-nupacks-with-startup-code-and-webactivator.aspx">WebActivator</a> library available on NuGet?<br>@Konstantin my team doesn't work on EF Code First, but if you install their tooling, I think they already provide that.<br>Also, I believe we already have an AppFabric caching provider so you can swap it out via web.config today.<br>What data annotation attributes would you like to see? We're adding more to the core .NET Framework, but you won't see them for a good while.</p>
