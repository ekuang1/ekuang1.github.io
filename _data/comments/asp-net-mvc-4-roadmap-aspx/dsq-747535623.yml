message: "<p>I'm not sure that I know exactly what I want, but I know my pain point: TDD is still way harder than it ought to be, especially when it comes to testing Javascript. Maybe a DSL for :<br>Add class Foo<br>  Method Bar<br>Which would bring up code multiple code snippets: a created class, a test class(I wouldn't have to specify tests, since TDD would be enabled by default),, a method Bar(), a test method for Bar. You setting the type is part of the snippet as well as creating the parameters. But you're not changing Bar() and Bar_SomeTest(), you're changing a signature and the code for the test and the method are changing simultaneously and the IDE is reflecting that in real time(ala Code Rush). A DSL not for code, but for the recipes.  <br>OK, this is crazy brainstorming, but I'll give you the pain points are you can figure them out:<br>1) Going from IDE window to IDE window. Create new class, solution explorer, test class file, class file, etc. Useful for organizing, but when writing boilerplate stuff, give me a simple way to write it in one place.<br>2) Repeating myself -- Why do I have to create a class and a test class? I should write it once. When I write a method, why do I have to specify the method name 3 times: in the method, the name of the test method, and the line in the test method that calls the method. I want a method. I want 3 tests. I should be able to write 4 things once.<br>3) Real-time indication of what's going to happen. I love how Code Rush does this with inline edits. If you can do what they do, but for entire recipes, you guys will be geniuses.<br>4) Promote code contracts with TDD together. Their goal is the same so shouldn't they play together?<br>5) Code generation is too hard.<br>6) Learning resources are painfully disconnected from the product. I'm always doing the same pattern: CRUD. I want to learn a better way. Fortunately, there are guys like Hanselman and Haack that tell me about T4, but why do I have to spend so much time searching for resources. If I'm in the library, I can ask the librarian how to use the online search system. If I'm in Visual Studio, shouldn't there be something telling me \"he bonehead, would you like to learn about snippets . . . you'e written the same code 50 times in the last week\".</p>"
