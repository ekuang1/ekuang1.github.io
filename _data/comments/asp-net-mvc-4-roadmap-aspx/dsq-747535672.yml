message: <p>I'd just like to add my voice to those calling for solutions to the "magic strings" problem that has plagued ASP.NET MVC since the beginning. I would also like to see improvements to the Razor editor, including better refactoring support (I should never have to use find/replace when renaming something) and more intelligent auto-formatting (the auto-formatter should indent code and markup in a logical/hierarchical manner).</p>
