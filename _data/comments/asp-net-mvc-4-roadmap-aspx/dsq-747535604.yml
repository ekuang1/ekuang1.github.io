message: <p>Hmm... not liking all this built-in wizardry. <br>Much of what is described as "recipes" can already be achieved quite easily using a great choice of third-party packages via the amazing Nuget - indeed the "Recipe API" seems more suited to be exposed to Nuget rather being a core part of the MVC system. I do not believe the MVC team should actually "supply" ANY recipes, just the API. Recipes should be chosen and installed by the developer.<br>CSS/Less,JS/Cofeescript bundling and compression support already available using the fantastic "Chirpy".<br>Some things I would like to see:<br>Full integration of T4MVC - no more Magic Strings<br>Official Sub-controllers<br>Official CSS/HTML "theme" support (I think also covers proposed "Mobile Application")<br>Pre-compiled views by default<br>ScriptSharp support<br>(not MVC) TRUE T4 editor for Visual Studio (Razor based)<br>(not MVC) EF Code First Data Migrations<br><br>I am sad to say this roadmap is leaving me slightly cold ... wizards, "recommended" libraries/plug-ins - but seemingly very little to improve the CORE of MVC.</p>
