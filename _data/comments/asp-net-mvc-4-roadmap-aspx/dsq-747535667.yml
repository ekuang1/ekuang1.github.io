message: <p>@Phil<br>It looks like you are not listening here. If I see one theme in the comments here but especially elsewhere (the places where .NET is discussed as 'my former platform of choice') it's that the MVC developers are not waiting for 'tooling'. They are a special bunch that can think for themselves, that innovate faster than your team (FubuMVC), that spot trends before your company even knew there was something else (simplified DB access).<br>Now I know Microsoft is in it for the tooling but MVC is the wrong vehicle for that. I don't think you are confident enough (like shanselman) to come out and discuss this issue. But I do want the record to show that there 'seems' to be a general feeling that we don't want tools, we want libraries. And anytime that you are ready to ask that question ("should we focus on tools or on the framework") we will be here to support you. If you are not confident, let shanselman do it (like he did this week with the versioning issue).<br>Also, if there already is a library that does X, you should NOT do X. Especially not when the reason you want to do X is because you can offer 'tooling'. Just back off, we got this, the community can handle it. <br>Thanks for listening!<br></p>
