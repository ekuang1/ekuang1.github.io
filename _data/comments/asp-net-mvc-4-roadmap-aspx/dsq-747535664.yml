message: "<p>Better handling for sub-collections of entities would be great, especially so that binding to an existing entity with a sub-collection of entities doesn't wipe out and re-create the entities in the sub-collection.  See for example: <a href=\"http://www.codetuning.net/blog/post/Binding-Model-Graphs-with-ASPNETMVC.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.codetuning.net/blog/post/Binding-Model-Graphs-with-ASPNETMVC.aspx\">www.codetuning.net/...</a><br>Support for CoffeeScript, SCSS, and LESS in the new asset manager, along with various minification options (including the ones with the best compression ratios, which means Closure and Uglify) would be great.  Even better would be baking support for these into Visual Studio (Intellisense, syntax highlighting, etc).  The new Rails asset manager in 3.1 is a good example to look at.<br>Yay for MVC! :)</p>"
