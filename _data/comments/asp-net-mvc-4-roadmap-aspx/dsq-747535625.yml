message: <p>* I would be really happy if you guys could implement Class Diagram tool for EF Code-First POCO classes, which would show entity classes, relationships between them, constraints etc. I think it should be pretty easy to implement but add lots of value (you could build it on top of existing Class Diagram tool).<br><a href="http://data.uservoice.com/forums/72025" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://data.uservoice.com/forums/72025">http://data.uservoice.com/forums/72025</a><br>* A new class(es) for caching, testable, with the same interface as Windows Azure AppFabric Caching, so it would be easy to switch between in-memory cache, Windows Server AppFabric Caching and Windows Azure AppFabric Caching as simple as a .config file setting change.<br>* Web app project should be pre-configured so that it starts up instantly at the first web request on the server.<br>* More build-in data annotations attributes which could be used in models.<br>* Good documentation and samples needed for custom MSDeploy configurations and maybe more options in Publish UI, where you could for example specify which folders should be created on the server, an ability to set permissions on them etc., specify a windows service which should be deployed alone with web app on the server.<br>...wait, there is more :)</p>
