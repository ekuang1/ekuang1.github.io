message: <p>It's not specific to MVC, but one of my major pains with ASP.NET is the frequent restarts that happen due to changes made in most of the built-in folders or when you update a dll. On a site with a bit of traffic, this is a BIG problem. <br>My wishlist:<br>1.) Possibility to update a dll to a new version without restarting the web application.<br>2.) Possibility to update a code file(or add new ones) in App_Code without restarting the web application. We're using a lot of code generation, and if we could do it without restarting the application, it would open up a lot of possibilities.<br>3.) To be able to delete folders without restarting the application. There are some nasty hacks to get around this, but it has some side effects. <br>In general, I think the focus on scaffolding is wasteful. In my experience, these days most web projects use a CMS. Scaffolding is more or less useless in that context. Those that aren't using a CMS for a web projects these days are often big projects where scaffolding doesn't fit very well IMO. <br>Do you actually know many companies that are using scaffolding for real projects in a non-trivial way?</p>
