message: <p>Phil, I've looked at WebActivator, but it seems to require source code being copied into a specific folder and it lacks any integration with an IoC container.<br>I'm worried that MVC seems to be headed towards a more "Wizard" future instead of one that encourages better application design and testing.</p>
