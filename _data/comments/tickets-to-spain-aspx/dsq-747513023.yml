message: <p>Codecruncher, I lived in Torrejon for three years when I was young, so even though it is residential, I have sentimental reasons for visiting it.  Though I wouldn't mind meeting up for some cafe con leche despu√©s.<br><br><br><br>Well I probably wouldn't mind being drunk the whole time, but not sure if my wife would like that. ;)  I'll check out the site, thanks!</p>
