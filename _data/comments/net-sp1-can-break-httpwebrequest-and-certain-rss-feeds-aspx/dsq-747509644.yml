message: <p>I had code that was working just fine to retrieve parameter limit info from a video server on a Win2K development system. My boss bought me a new computer that came with XP and and a new install of the .NET runtime that included SP1. <br><br><br><br>All of a sudden, the code stopped working with a protocol violation at the HTTPWebRequest.GetResponse(). What's irritating to me is that the URLs still work just fine with IE 6.0 browser or the axWebBrowser control. <br><br><br><br>The video server is one that is made by a sister company, so I can't very well go to them and say "FIX YER SHIT". I hope your workaround works for me. -guy<br><br></p>
