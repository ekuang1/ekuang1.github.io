message: <p>There is an interesting aspect to this. Smaller children mostly go by<br>the tone of voice when we correct them, and do not really consider the words<br>much. At 4-6 though the actual words carry more weight, but they still tend to<br>fall back on placing more weight on the tone of your voice.</p><p>Here things get interesting. You child clearly understood that the words<br>where confrontational, but perhaps the calmness of your wifeâ€™s voice did not<br>clue her into the degree of seriousness of the situation. In this case, the child reacted<br>to the words but being on relatively new territory (words not tone), missed the<br>degree of seriousness and thus overreacted.</p><p>I made the same mistake more than once forgetting that just be course my<br>kids were old enough to reason with, they still needed a bit of guidance in<br>understanding what was going on by keeping those clues that clear tone of voice<br>etc. can provide a bit longer.</p>
