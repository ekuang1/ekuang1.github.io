message: <p>The only frustrating thing is that they already created a new stack with Web API which is only a couple years old at this point and that is being tossed out as well. I really like the new stack so I will suck it up, but I do wish they had just skipped the whole Web API thing altogether and caused us a little less pain.</p>
