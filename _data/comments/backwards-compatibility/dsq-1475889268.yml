message: <p>"It represents a new modular approach that makes it easier to swap out the parts you don't like"</p><p>Hm... to be honest the only part I don't like is ASP.NET vNext and would swap it out. It looks like a reckless gimmick scheme. People use ASP.NET because it is fast (async IO), stable and compatible. Those kiddish new frameworks are joke (with Node as the only pleasant exception).</p><p>Other commenter would say "this is life" but I would say "this is the road to hell where everything is broken, limited, unstable and incompatible". Windows Store full screen apps are great example of pseudo-innovation. They are joke. The money they bring are joke. The fact that I can't resize them is joke.</p><p>System.Web is beautiful. It is monolithic. It is well-designed. It is useful, optimized and nearly bug-free.</p><p>vNext, what the heck. vBS is a better name for that thing.</p>
