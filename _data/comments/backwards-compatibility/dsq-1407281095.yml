The Web API thing was a great example of [Conway's Law in effect](<a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2013/05/13/applying-conways-law.aspx/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://haacked.com/archive/2013/05/13/applying-conways-law.aspx/)">https://haacked.com/archive/...</a>.</p><p>The team that built that and the ASP.NET team was reorganized into the same larger team under Guthrie when I was still at Microsoft. That's why you saw a concerted effort to merge the two with ASP.NET MVC 4. They were too different for that to fully happen, but it was the start of that process.</p><p>Now that Guthrie is in charge of all of Cloud and Server, I don't think you'll see that happen again.</p>
