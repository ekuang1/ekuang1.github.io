message: <p>I had to give up on D&amp;D when I headed off for college, it would have ruined me socially.  But I'm in when you fire up the Hughes Ave game.  <br><br><br><br>Reminds me of the last time I played.  I had always wanted to play a beast-rider but if the DM had allowed me to have any kind of a cool animal I would have been too powerful and thrown the game off.  The DM offered me a goat instead.  I called his bluff and became Asgar the Goat-Master with his fierce mount "Lemon".  It was great until the rest of the team turned on me and Lemon became supper that night.  I lost my roll against my constitution score and went insane, running naked into the woods to be killed by trolls.  <br><br><br><br>Oh well, hand me the 20+ dice.</p>
