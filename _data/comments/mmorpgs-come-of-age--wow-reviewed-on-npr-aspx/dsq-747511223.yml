message: <p>Niels:<br><br>The guy on the radio show said he played 160 hrs in the past two months.  How much time do you spend on it?  After hearing about it, I'm very tempted, but concerned about the addictive aspect to it.<br><br><br><br>I don't play D&amp;D anymore.  I once got a game up at Solien in the conference room. It lasted one evening total.  It's too difficult to get people's schedules to align. If I were to start it up again, I'd just tell people that I'm doing research into building the next great MMORPG.<br><br><br><br>Chris:<br><br>How much longer are you in Iraq?  I'm working on Akumi, though she was one of the cool kids back in the day.  But I'll convince her to join our "research" sessions.</p>
