message: <p>Well it can be VERY adicting at first.  I tend to play alot of the weekends and maybe a couple nights a week on the weekday for a couple of hours.  Its very tempting to play all day because you get to meet alot of new people and hell of a time.<br><br><br><br>What I've been doing is playing with my brother and cousin up in Canada and my other brother here in the States.  Its great because its something we can all do together without actually flying a couple thousand miles to do so.  We also have a couple of guys on the hockey team playing with us and when you have a clan like that you can become pretty powerful in the game.<br><br><br><br>The games just amazing.  However you have to make more out of it then just killing things because after a while you will get bored of the game.</p>
