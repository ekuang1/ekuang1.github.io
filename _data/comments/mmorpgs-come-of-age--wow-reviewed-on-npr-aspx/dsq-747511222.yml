message: <p>Hey Phil,<br><br><br><br>Doing D&amp;D with Dice is still looked down on as geek with some freaks hanging out together.  I would not recommend you go around telling your clients you play D&amp;D! :)<br><br><br><br>However MMORPG is completely different.  YOu would be surprised on who is playing. Everyone I talk to these days seem to be playing WOW or EQII and are not afraid to talk about it.  Hell I even know of Sales people playing WOW (gasp!) Its true!<br><br><br><br>WOW = World of Warcraft.<br><br><br><br>If yo go around saying World of Warcraft then your a newbie!<br><br><br><br>Last week I was playing poker at a Casinio and my brother called me up to ask me about the game and I said the word WOW during our conversation and 3 heads went up.  After I got off the phone one of them asked me if I played WOW.  I said yes and the other two said they play also.  Pretty funny stuff!<br><br><br><br></p>
