message: <p>IMO 8h work days are there to protect workers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day">Eight-hour_day</a>. But to be effective in today's global economy it should be enforced worldwide. Otherwise I'm afraid that competition will force us to work 12-15h per day. <br></p>
