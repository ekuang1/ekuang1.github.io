message: <p>@Apostol A few years back there was a similar thing in schools in the UK. League tables were produced, with the intention of identifying schools that were struggling. Money would then be plumbed into those schools to help them do better.<br>But of course, some of the schools on the borderline purposely made their stats a little worse to get extra funding.</p>
