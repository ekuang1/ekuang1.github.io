message: "<p>re: Apostol's comment above and slightly off topic: the health industry isn't interested in healthy people or dead people. Only in people who are ill. This leads to almost all of us being diagnosed with some problem or other so they can sell us their services and drugs.<br>As for quotas. I think this is a really good discussion to have. I suppose from a freelancer point of view, the best is to charge per hour and set your hourly rate as high as you feel is appropriate for your ability and experience. The problem is companies don't like this and often want fixed price quotes. In my opinion this results in more costs to them as a freelancer has to budget for unexpected stuff and invariably doubles or tripples his/her quote. This can lead to situations where a company ends up paying $1000s for a few hours work because they wanted a fixed price quote. Of course the reverse is also true.</p>"
