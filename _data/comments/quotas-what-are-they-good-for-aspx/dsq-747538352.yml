message: <p>While I do agree with the sentiments expressed, it is difficult to imagine a different world to the typical "set working hours" regime that we live with currently.  Perhaps I'm just not imaginative enough.<br>But it is understandable for employers (and employees!) to want to put in place some protections against being taken advantage of.  No employer will give you a set salary without putting in place some parameters for what they expect in return... and hours worked is at least an unambigious metric.<br>It would take a very brave business owner to allow staff to work whatever hours they think are appropriate for delivering value.<br>On some level, they *ARE* paying for your time.  How much your time is worth is typically what varies.<br>From the other comments here, I do note how easy it is to find other examples of bad metrics ... but it is clearly more difficult to find workable suggestions which would be an improvement.</p>
