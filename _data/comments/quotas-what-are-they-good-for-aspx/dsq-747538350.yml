message: <p>I can't imagine any quota that would ever be a decent measure of a good developer. It's not the lines of code, amount of comments, or hours worked. It's more abstract like how much effort was put in, how much was learned, how happy was the client, how much value was provided to the employer, etc.<br>I think every developer on every project is at a different level of understanding. So one developer may be able to do a project on time and make the client happy while another one who put in more effort may have some weakness in an area that caused the project to be late or make a client angry. Which one reached the quota? The one that put in the effort, or the one with more experience who made the client happy?<br>It's like trying to measure a student's success in school by some standardized method. Every student has talents in some areas and problems in other areas. Trying to compare one student with another is like comparing apples to oranges.<br>So, I think it's too abstract to measure by one specific quantitative value. You almost have to measure the developer to his own effort and ability.</p>
