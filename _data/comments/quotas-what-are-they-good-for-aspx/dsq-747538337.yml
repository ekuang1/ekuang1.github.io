message: <p>An example of a place where quotas are misused is also one of the great problems of our society - medical services. Everywhere in the medical industry the doctors and medical staff and hospitals a paid for treatment of diseases, not cure. So more or less the system suggests if there are more treated people(sick people) - you get more funding. <br>You could reverse that and make it so if you cure more people from a disease - you get more funding. Or if you get funding based on the healthy people in the hospital's area instead of the 'treated' ones.<br>Imagine how much more motivated would the medical industry to produce healthier people and nation instead of a sick one.</p>
