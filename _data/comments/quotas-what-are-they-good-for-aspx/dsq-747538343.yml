message: <p>I would have thought that stuff like "10% time" was a good example - you've already agreed upfront that the employee can spend their time on whatever takes their fancy so there isn't really a negative unintended consequence - any risk associated with abusing the time falls entirely on the employee (and in any case, its likely that same abuse would be present in the other 90% time anyway...)</p>
