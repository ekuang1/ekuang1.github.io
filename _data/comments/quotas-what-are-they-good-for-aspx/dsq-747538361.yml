message: <p>A rarely (purposefully) used but sometimes effective strategy is to frequently change quotas. Since each individual quota does presumably work in the direction of optimizing some desirable aspect (eg minimum hours in the office might help get people working together more), by switching the main measurement somewhat frequently and in an unpredictable manner you can achieve some useful results.</p>
