message: <p>One of the better candidates I've heard for a good quota is minimum vacation time (thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/rioter" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://twitter.com/rioter">@rioter!</a>). It's good for workers as they need to replenish. Good for employers because burnout is costly to the bottom line.<br>@Bertrand nothing could go wrong! ;p<br></p>
