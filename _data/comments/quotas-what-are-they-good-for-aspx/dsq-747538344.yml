message: <p>Don't get me wrong in the following - I totally agree with the reasoning in your post and the references cited. It's only a small stretch to apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to any performance measurement system, especially in the HR world (the mechanism of measuring and the choice of what is measured will tend to skewer the output, as employees "work to the test").<br>However, the desirability of the outcome you ask about is a perspective-based quantity as well. Think sales quota's. From the Sales managere's standpoint, imposition of sales quotas may well have the "desired" effect(s) of increasing overall sales, while also identifying sup-par performers. However, from the perspective of good customer service, the impact may be less fruitful, as sale people focus no selling to meet the quota, without regard for the actual needs of the customer. <br>I don't believe imposing a quota can be accomplished without causing some unintended consequence. A more effective strategy (which will *still* suffer from the impact of the measurement mechanism) is to establish targets which mitigate the most visible areas of undesirable consequence e.g:<br>"The Sales Team will achieve a 10% quarterly increase in sales revenue, while maintaining a 98% customer satisfaction rating and 80% customer retention."<br>Or however you want to express it (note I made up nonsense percentages). This strategy at least attempts to impose constraints upon those areas which would likely suffer if only the first metric ("Increased Sales") were in place. <br>Great post - thought-provoking. No doubt, as soon as I hit the submit button, I will think of some candidate answr to your original question!</p>
