message: "<p>\"Work is something you do, not a place you go to\"<br>I guess it depends on your contract and legal system. But to me it boils down to this: if your employer is happy with your results, they should try to keep you on board. If they're not happy with them, they should let you go.<br>What makes them happy depends on the job, but surely the time you needed to achieve those results should not count. And if it did, it should count in a negative way. It's not the quantity of time needed, but the quantity AND quality of actual results that matter.<br>Take an example: your house needs a paint job. How will you choose your contracter? Will you prefer the one that will need the most time to do it? Of course not. In fact, when you have a choice of two contracters with equal reputation and total price, you will use the one that get's the job done in the smallest amount of time. Otherwise, you'll look at the value for money ratio, within contraints (minimum quality wanted, maximum amount of money to spend).<br>Now the question really is: can you quantify results? <br>Measuring square meters of paint on a wall is easy, but how do you measure the quality?<br>It turns out to be a very difficult thing to do, if you want absolute numbers. However, ranking employees based on relative performance seems easier, especially if you use peer review or a 360Â° evaluation scheme.<br>Employers should try to keep the employees they want to keep. Quantifying why they want to keep them is actually less important. Employees should try to get or keep the job they want. Again, quantifying why is not important.</p>"
