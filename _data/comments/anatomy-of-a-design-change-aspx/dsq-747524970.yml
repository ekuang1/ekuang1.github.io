message: <p>It's interesting that no one has offered up a real-world analogy.  I'll give it a shot.  Most guys, and some gals, will understand on a basic level, the concept of working on a car, right?  Well, maybe.  <br>I used to own a 1968 Land Cruiser -- nice rig.  Had the bare-bones basics.  Three on the tree, flat six, no stereo, manually locking hubs.  I needed to replace the fuel pump once, so I popped open the hood, and there it was on the right side of the block.  Took me less than 30 minutes to replace.<br>Then, years later, my dad needed his fuel filter replaced in his rig -- a 1998 (?) Jeep Cherokee Sport.  Now, I wasn't there, but my uncle was.  I was figuring, eh, it'll take them about 30-60 minutes to do the job.  Problem was, solving the same problem on that rig was quite a bit different, as it turns out that the automobile industry had progressed quite a bit in thirty years.  After looking in the engine compartment, searching around, and finally referencing the appropriate manual, they learned that the pump wasn't in the engine compartment at all, but was in the gas tank itself.  So, "changing the fuel pump" (same problem on my '68 Cruiser) ended up being a very complicated task, indeed.<br>Perhaps not the best analogy, but it might be a start.  Of course, I'm not sure that likening software types to mechanics is such a good idea...  We all know how many people love mechanics.</p>
