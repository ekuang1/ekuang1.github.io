message: <p>Thanks for the great take on this.<br>Love the behavior, glad to see something at microsoft that has a stance. Most other teams would implement a switch between negative and positive attributes with a class level attribute, thus making my life more and more configuration nightmare. However you guys realized, the inheritance is the opt in, I love it.<br>Analogies (bad and otherwise):<br>- a mullet, looks short up front, on the back end goes forever.<br>- buying a house, everyone owns one, we've been doing it for centuries, it still takes 50 people and 60 days to make the purchase.<br>- setting the time on your vcr, small task, big problem<br>- its mole hill, if your a giant, problem is, we're ants</p>
