message: <p>@Lou the idea is that [NonAction] makes it so that the action doesn't even exist. Whereas what you proposed would mean that the action does exist, but returns a 405 "Method not allowed". They are semantically different.<br>I suppose, could remove the NonAction attribute and you could make a public method "not an action" by simply calling <code>HandleUnknownAction</code>.</p>
