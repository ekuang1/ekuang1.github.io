message: <p>In my experience it is generally the edge cases that cause all the problems.  Non-technical bosses tend to think in general terms  so it is very hard for them to internalize all of the problems edge cases create.<br>To help them understand you need to find something they are interested in and relate it to that.  If they are a skier, you might relate it to a bird landing on a particular patch of snow that causes and avalanche.  For some one into home improvement you might relate it to removing a section of a wall to expand you kitchen only to find you have a termite infestation.</p>
