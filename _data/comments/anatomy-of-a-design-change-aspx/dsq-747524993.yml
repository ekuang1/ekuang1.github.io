message: <p>I've been writing software four about thirty years now. During that time I've always been searching for the silver bullet to make my projects run smoothly and result in a high quality product. I tried many languages, frameworks and integrated application development environments. I looked at different design methodologies, diagramming techniques and paradigms. I got all involved in CMM levels, continuous process improvement, six sigma, ect. at the many companies I've worked for.<br>Now I develop and operate small small web-enabled applications for clients. I only take on projects I can handle myself using one very flexible tool; Lotus Notes/Domino.<br>I know, I know ... you're all rolling your eyes and groaning. I hated it at first, thinking they were trying to be all things to all people ... and they were. But I got past that and now I use Domino for one thing only; web application development/operation. I've never found a more flexible, simple and complete set of tools that lets me create, operate and maintain small web applications.<br>Even though IBM/Lotus has sadly neglected the further development of the dynamic HTML generation for many years, I've still found nothing that can replace this set of tools. It just hits a sweet spot, at least for me, that I just love.<br>Now for the final heresy; I make changes to the production code. That's right. I know the conventional wisdom is to make the change, test the change, them merge it into production very carefully. Well, Notes/Domino makes it easy for me to make changes to the production system without the users even noticing it, in most cases. That is until some new feature just magically appears.<br>This all lets me keep costs at an absolute minimum while responding to feature requests and bug fixes sometimes in just minutes. I often add a new feature for a client while they're still on the phone with me. It doesn't get any better (or more fun) than that!<br>Peace,<br>Rob:-]<br>p.s. And yes, I'm aware this won't work on larger projects written in compiled languages (however, most of my code is written in Java that runs in the server side within the Domino environment.) rs</p>
