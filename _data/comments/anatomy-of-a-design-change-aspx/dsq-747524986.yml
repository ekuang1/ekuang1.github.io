message: <p>I have another analogy one for you that's also based on cars and personal. Scuffed paint and broken window.<br>I scuffed the front bumper on a parking thing, not bad but enough to show and it had some yellow paint highlights. I'm thinking it's just painting over it with a standard color. I asked for an estimate when I was getting some routine stuff done anyway and I'm thinking a hundred or two maybe on the outside. Nope! Seven or eight hundred with materials and labor because you also have to blend the paint with the surrounding area and it has an automotive finish and the small size really doesn't matter in the end.<br>On the other hand one day my window didn't go up. So it's halfway down and I'm thinking I don't even know where the fuses are to check that, and it could be the car's electrical is fried, or maybe the door will need to be torn down if it's a mechanical failure in the window itself. After the paint surprise I'm just hoping it's less than a thousand but the guy doesn't even need to look at it to say, "Probably the motor, they go all the time. It'll be eighty bucks and about an hour."<br>So - scuffed paint is disaster and broken window is nothing.<br></p>
