message: <p>@Haacked<br>I believed you only did the ActionResult on RenderView. But it's nice to hear that you did this for Actions to. If I could say it, I would say that this is a good design ;)<br>I'll look @ the solution, my wife needs a little shop, so I'll will try implement it with Asp.Net MVC.<br>Have a nice weekend.</p>
