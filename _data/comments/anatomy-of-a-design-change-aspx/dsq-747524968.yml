message: <p>I understand the "methods in a controller are implicitly actions" line of reasoning, but IMHO the potential for hard to spot problems related to interface inheritence (e.g. with your IDisposable example) mean a "safe by default" policy would require explicitly marking which methods are actions rather than which are not.</p>
