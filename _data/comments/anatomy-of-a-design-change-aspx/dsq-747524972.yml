message: <p>I think everything should be locked from start, and then we unlock things that should be open for public. By open up everything by default require us to make sure we don’t forget to close the things that shouldn’t be open. It’s easy to unlock things that should be public than lock thinks that shouldn’t at least that is my opinion.<br>Btw, why should it be possible at all to make a call to a method that doesn’t return an ActionResult? I can’t see why that should be possible at all.<br></p>
