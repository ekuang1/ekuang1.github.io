message: <p>Someone (Dusty) already called me out on this one. :)<br>I have to admit that I never knew you could do that with the label control. Not sure how I missed it all this time. I even went as far as adding a custom control to community server which does the same thing as Label.AssociatedControlId.<br>It is a big framework and I still learn something new everyday. :)<br>Thanks,<br>Scott</p>
