message: <p>I believe the biggest use out of using the label tag is for check boxes and radio buttons.  Instead of clicking the small box or rounded dot, I (and others I'm sure) like clicking the associated text.<br>In fact you can associate a label with any other form type of control, not just the text box.  Drop downs and text areas will work too.<br>Two other important attributes that you can add with a label are the AccessKey and Tooltip, mainly for accessibility.</p>
