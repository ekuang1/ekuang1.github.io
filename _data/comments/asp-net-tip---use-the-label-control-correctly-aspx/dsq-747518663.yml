message: <p>The reason for the confusion (and the reason Scott probably didn't know about it), is because this wasn't true until .NET 2.0.<br>With the ASP.NET 1.1 Label control, there was no AssociatedControlId property - it really was just a brain dead Literal that just rendered a span tag.<br>With all the fanfare of the new controls and functionality in 2.0, somehow a new property on the lowly Label control got overlooked ;)</p>
