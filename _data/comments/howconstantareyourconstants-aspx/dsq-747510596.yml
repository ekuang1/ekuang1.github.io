message: <p>Semantics indeed! If you plan on, or don't plan on (but still leave the door open to) changing the value sometime in the near or far future, then how can we call it a constant. <br><br><br><br>"Is it simply a variable with a value set at compile time often used to consolidate a setting in one place? Or is it a variable that holds a value that never changes, not even from build to build? " -- Perhaps its neither? Maybe we should look at constants not as variables, but as constants.<br><br><br><br>Is CYCLES_NEEDED comparable to SPEED_OF_LIGHT? Like you said, it depends. <br><br><br><br>Great article, fun read.</p>
