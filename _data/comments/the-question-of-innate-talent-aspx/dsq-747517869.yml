message: <p>I think it has less to do with innate talent and more to do with personality.  I know a lot of people that are much smarter than me - at math, science, English, just about every field you can imagine.  However, there is no way they could ever become a programmers.<br>Why not?  Is it because I don't think they could learn the syntax or data structures?  The basic logic?  No, it's simply a lack of desire to do so.  <br>Being able to remain focused while staring at a computer screen all day reading symbols like they were a literary masterpiece is a unique trait.  You have to appreciate and like what you do in order to be any good at it.</p>
