message: <p>It's interesting to see Jon Udell discussing the same basic question - innate talent vs. learned skill - in context of web searching:<br><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/12/04.html#a1571" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/12/04.html#a1571">http://weblog.infoworld.com...</a><br>Sure, we can bring an understanding of boolean logic and how search engines work to the table, but at the end of the day a lot of it is a learned skill through trial and error.</p>
