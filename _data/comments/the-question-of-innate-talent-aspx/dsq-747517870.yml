message: <p>I left this comment on the lesser known <a href="http://phil.haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="phil.haacked.com">phil.haacked.com</a>, little did I know all of the other responses were on the "technical blog."<br>Phil, you write that "it turns out that the quality of effortful study is a big factor in moving from novice to expert. So not everyone will become an expert in 10 years, only those who continue to push themselves." <br>Sounds plausible. However, I have a feeling the quality of a person's innate ability probably also has a lot to do with it.<br>It may take 10-years to develop an expertise, but I doubt very much that anyone can develop an expertise in a given field merely by putting sufficient "effortful study" into it for 10-years. I beleive some people have the skills or talent necessary to become an expert in 10 years (or less, with or without effortful study), others can put in the same effort or more for a longer period of time with little result. <br>As for child prodigies, they become prodigies far younger than 10 years old, and I doubt very much they somehow squeaze 10-years of effort into the 4 - 9 years of their young lives (see articles below). The child who was attending Julliard at age 10 and wrote 5 symphonies by the time he was 13 years old says he hears multiple channels of music in his mind's ear. I doubt you or I could pull this off after 10 years of study, no matter how effortful.<br>So Phil, you not be playing in the World Cup after 10 years of practicing with your new soccer ball at home, on the other hand, your skill at programming may be due to more than "efforful study." Thank Mom and Dad. <br><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/22/60minutes/main2205521.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/22/60minutes/main2205521.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stor...</a><br><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/07/11/60II/main708142.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/07/11/60II/main708142.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stor...</a> <br></p>
