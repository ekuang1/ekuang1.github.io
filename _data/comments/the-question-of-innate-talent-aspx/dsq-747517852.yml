message: <p>I think the "Have it" part goes more towards the traits lending to the skill, rather than the actual skill itself. <br>One of the more "interesting" personalities in our CSK community was a guy named Rafal who would post messages to our board at the rate of about 1 per 20 minutes - often having a conversation with himself on certain problems. He was by an order of magnitude our most prolific poster.<br>I read up his bio and also a little more on his personal site and it turns out he's a chess grand champion, and his dominant talent is a single-minded intensity towards his goal - often wearing down his opposition with his relentless strategy.<br>I saw this "intensity" daily on our forums and while it was a bit of a "challenge", I admired it. I remember thinking that if you pointed this kid's nose in the right direction, he could do some real good work.<br>To me, if you mix and match certain traits you have the makings of an "expert". Perhaps a dash of rebelliousness (for kicking the norm to the curb), a heavy dose of tenacity, and a flamingly curious mind gently baked over 10 years...<br>This gets even more fun as you watch these things develop in childhood. I have two wonderful kiddos and it sure is fun to see the differences - all from genetics! I'm convinced that my oldest daughter will be a mathematician and my youngest will be prom queen :).</p>
