message: <p>Ah, so if I start training my 1 year old now, by the time she is ten she'll be a physicist?<br>No, of course not. That's ridiculous. But, if I put her in a language class, with a native speaker, she'll end up being fluent in less than 10 years and with no traceable accent. If I take the same class, I'll still have an accent in 10 years. There are certain ages and time frames, early years for languages, middle years for math, late teens for physical activity, that make it much easier to become an expert. Then there is the tick, tick, ticking of the clock in our bodies. Generally, your brain gets softer the older you get (literally, look it up! ;) ) and so does your body. Making it more difficult to do the same things you could in your youth. Think Michael Jordan could beat the best college player today? Maybe, think he could in 10 years? Probably not.<br>Eh, I'm gonna leave it at that. I'm too old for this kind of mental activity. ;)</p>
