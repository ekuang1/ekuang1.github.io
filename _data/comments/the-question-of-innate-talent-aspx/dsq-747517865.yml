message: <p>Bah! Desire is a silly 80's song by two weird twins dressed like Pinatas. Like the song, desire is iconic of the 80's anyway :). Tony Robbins can only get you so far!<br>Seriously though, I've knows people who really, really wanted to do well at development and just had no... "there" there. There are just some blocks that must remain uncut.<br></p>
