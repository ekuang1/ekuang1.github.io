message: <p>This really isn't a new thing for Joel.  He's had a pretty arrogant tone since day one.  <br><br><br><br>He's a self proclaimed authority.  It is an example of talking with authority and people automatically assigning authority.  <br><br><br><br>Consider how Joel started Fog Creek.  In the early part of this decade a lot of us were in shit recovery mode after the stock market crash.  We didn't have Microsoft stock.  We didn't have Juno stock.  We didn't have google stock (Joel admits to having pre-IPO google stock.  How he got it he doesn't say).  There is no way would could have just setup shop in NYC.<br><br><br><br>With that said, Joel's a great writer, and I have thank him for going to bat for hiring a few smart people locally when everybody else was outsourcing overseas.  <br><br></p>
