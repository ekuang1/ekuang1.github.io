message: <p>True enough. I blame the punk rawk of my youth for my attitude. Although if you think your tone was virulent, you should have read my first post. I pointed out that no one who worked on Excel and VBA should be lecturing about proper design except in a 'don't do as we did' capacity. LOL<br><br><br><br>I feel the same way about Paul Graham too. I like a lot of what he says, but when he's wrong, he's WAY wrong. And he ventures into "making stuff up" territory too often.</p>
