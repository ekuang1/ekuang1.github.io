message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Im having difficulty testing the controllers actions by mocking everything.<br>The ControllerContext class has no interface so I can't mock it. Id like to expect a call to ViewContext.GetControllerContext, but ViewContext, ControllerContext or RequestContext dont have interfaces.<br>Am I doing something wrong or should I request you guys t put interfaces on these classes?</p>
