message: <p>Actually... count your blessings that you are able to use that approach. Its a borderline ideal way to know about a potential employees capabilities. I'm a little envious that you are able to do this. Recently I showed our CEO a statistic on Sam Gentiles blog where his team of 7 did so much more than my team of 30 (mostly offshore) developers its not even funny. Actually I should probably post the experience of it all since it maybe a helpful reference for local companies bidding against offshore outfits</p>
