message: <p>I fervently agree Phil.  The best developers are always the folks who genuinely enjoy software development.<br>Flip it around the other way as well.  I pursued my current job in no small part because I was familiar with some of the bloggers who worked here.<br>I do know of one case where a certain company built an entire office by recruiting the developers behind all the OSS tools they liked on SourceForge.  They got a lot of strong developers but ended up with multiple build systems and 4 different persistence frameworks on one large project;)</p>
