message: <p>Hehe... I have a blog, it just hasn't been posted to in about six months!!  As soon as this remodel crap gets done (and a certain large southern california labor union gets rolled out on a certain software package) I plan on reviving my blog, possibly with an emphasis on seldom-known commercial software, so that readers of my blog can pull a Micah on site with a client and be like "oh, you guys sell electrical conduit to oil refineries?  I hear that XYZ (who makes software especially for your type of business) just released a new version with a web service interface!" ...and watch the clients swoon all over each other!<br>That said, I'm probably the only person reading this post who doesn't know about Bill Johnson, who's already thought of this, and dedicates about four hours a day to it ;-)</p>
