No browser actually parses HTML this way, but it's the rule regardless. You get tripped up if you start parsing HTML using something based on a real SGML parser, though, since people tend to stick those XHTML-like constructs around even when the whole rest of the document is vanilla HTML4.<br><br><br><br>So I guess the lesson is not to say HTML when you mean XML. :)</p>
