message: <p>You missed my point completely!!!! I am totally feed up with the ongoing childishness displayed by the campaign (period).   An editorial in my local paper clearly stated the issue.  Kerry can't win just on Bush-bashing.  Given recent polls I would say this approach to the campaign is loosing votes.  Most voters want adult discussions of the issues and when you see childish DNC ads you really do move on to another site.  I was criticizing the tatics being used by Kerry's supporters not the persons individually.  Name-calling proves nothing but close-mindness.  Sorry you took offense.  I also have relatives who are gay, but regard other issues more important.  The other side of your question involves 50% of the population who support Bush.  Surely you did not mean to imply-like Moore-that Americans are stupid.  Most Americans would disagree with that comment.</p>
