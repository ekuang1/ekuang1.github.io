message: <p>Actually, what I put (&lt;SALUTE/&gt;) is the correct HTML representation of a FULL Salute. ;) <br><br><br><br>It's equivalent to &lt;SALUTE&gt;&lt;/SALUTE&gt; <br><br>But then again, the only people who care are anal geeks like you and me. :) <br><br><br><br>And for you non geeks out there, this image is funny because &lt;/TagName&gt; is the format for an HTML end tag. Thus, &lt;/BUSH&gt; means end Bush or in other words, no more Bush. I showed this to my lovely wife who basically replied, "umm...ok. I think I'll continue to have a life while you do your nerd thing."</p>
