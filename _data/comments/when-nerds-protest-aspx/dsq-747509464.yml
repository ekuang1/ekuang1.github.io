message: <p>Hey -- that's actually me with my sign in the photo, but I have to give credit where it's due -- my friend tzikeh saw the slogan online while browsing (she thinks it was probably at <a href="http://www.tshirthell.com/shirts/tshirt.php?sku=a335" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.tshirthell.com/shirts/tshirt.php?sku=a335">http://www.tshirthell.com/shirts/tshirt.php?sku=a335</a> , the same link Clara posted up above). She mentioned it to me when I was trying to figure out what to put on my sign, and I immediately went for it.<br><br><br><br>Glad you all got a kick out of it regardless of its compliance to the latest HTML standard. ;) The march was a blast. <br><br></p>
