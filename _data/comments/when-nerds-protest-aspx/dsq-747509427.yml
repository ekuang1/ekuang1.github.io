message: <p>After I took this picture, I contemplated making a sign even geekier for the next protest and if that were possible.  I came up with:<br><br><br><br>   bush.impeach();<br><br><br><br>or <br><br><br><br>  bush.destroy();<br><br><br><br>In the end it doesn't matter because it would never compete with the giant foam penis that was running around or the group of topless women with stickers over their nipples, which, by the way, I would describe as:<br><br><br><br>  nipples.setCoveredWith( "stickers" ) == AWESOME<br><br><br><br></p>
