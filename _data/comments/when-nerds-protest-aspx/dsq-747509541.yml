message: <p>The fun part about this is that since &lt; and &gt; are so under-used in language, that every tag-involved scripting or programming language currently in widespread use uses it... So I think just about everyone on this whole comment list, by now, has stated an actual and probable code tidbit.<br><br><br><br>&lt;Patching to... Bush 2.0&gt;<br><br>-- Removing stick from butt...

To achieve a level of self-loathing necessary for the kind of whining your really need to do in politics takes a great achievement in ambition toward whining. People can't honestly expect that whining comes naturally? No, its a learned skilled. You have to pick it up from whiney parents, whiney friends, and the whiniest damn country I've ever lived in... And to the earlier comment about michael moore?... America -is- stupid. But we like it that way. The Rockefellers didn't start standardised schooling through massive donations so that kids could be smart, the robber-barons did it so kids would be pliable. It gives the elitist software-industrial complex a leg up and an easier lifestyle ;)<br><br><br><br>Hell, if it weren't for whiners, we'd have to whine for ourselves... Can't have that, now can we? Sheesh. I mean really... Then where would cynical sarcasm get us?</p>
