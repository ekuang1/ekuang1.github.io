message: <p>*ahem* You mean seriousLY, I'm sure.<br><br><br><br>I have a legitimate question for scrappengal, however.  I don't like Kerry, either, but I haven't heard one convincing argument for Bush.  Keep in mind that I dislike his views from the outset because my mom is gay, but I would like to hear what about him you think is so excellent that he should be our president. Seriously, the people to whom I have spoken have been utter morons with no valid opinions on his issues.  Now, I know that there must be informed Republicans out there with reasons other than that "He's a God-fearing, family-oriented man" because I can't bear to think that an entire 50% of the country could possibly be that stupid.  As an American citizen, how do you justify your vote for Bush?  Please be specific and back up your points.</p>
