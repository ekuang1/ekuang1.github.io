message: <p>Actually, it's perfectly reasonable to put it in all caps. Capitalization is a non-issue here. While I, personally, think coding looks neater when it's all in lower case, there is no reason why one cannot do it LIKE THIS.<br><br><br><br>And, yes, I believe the idea was that it opened in 2000 with &lt;BUSH&gt; and will close this year with &lt;/BUSH&gt; if all goes well.<br><br><br><br>Though, really, they should be using stylesheets. Stylesheets are so much nicer.</p>
