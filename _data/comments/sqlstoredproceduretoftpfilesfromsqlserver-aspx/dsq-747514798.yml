message: "<p>Weird. If you look at the query, there's the following snippet.<br><code><br>create table #a (id int identity(1,1), s varchar(1000))<br>insert #a exec master..xp_cmdshell @cmd<br></code><br>The first line creates the temp table, the second line inserts into it. Not sure why that wouldn't work as part of a DTS package.</p>"
