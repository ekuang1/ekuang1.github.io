It seems CloseFigure() works a bit differently in that it if you have more than one PathPointType of CloseSubPath it throws a \"Parameter is not valid\" exception. I managed to fix this by removing the gp.ClosePath() from AddPointToGraphicsPath() and putting in patch.ClosePath() in PatchSize set{} after the for loop has completed.\"<br>Where ClosePath should be: CloseFigure.</p>"
