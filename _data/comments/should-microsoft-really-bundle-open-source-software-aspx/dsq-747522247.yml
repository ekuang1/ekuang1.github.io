message: <p>MS will be sued regardless of whether they ship OSS or not.  They got the cash and that's how this country works.  If wish, they'd get with the program already because building a competing applets to everything OSS out there just pollutes the water.<br>For instance, what was the point of SandCastle.  They needlessly stepped on NDoc and Sandcastle is still barely working.<br>Finally, the list of tools needed for a productive installation is almost all OSS and keeps growing, requiring hunting and gathering before having a working environment.  It would be good to have an option in VS to install the OSS pack (*Unit, *Mock, common plugins like GhostDoc, etc...).  <br></p>
