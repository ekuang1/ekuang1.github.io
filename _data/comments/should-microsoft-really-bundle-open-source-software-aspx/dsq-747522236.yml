message: <p>Regarding the legal issues and fear of lawsuits, these same considerations apply to Apple, and yet huge portions of MacOS X are open-sourced - mostly BSD-licensed, but GPL-licensed components are included as well. So, I have a hard time believing that's what's inhibiting MS from including more open-source software with Windows.</p>
