message: <p>It seems to me that if lawyers can create a EULA for commercial software, lawyers can create a disclaimer that insulates MS from any action resulting from the bundling of OSS software with their products.<br>As I said in JG's post, Ok so they can't/won't bundle it, what's preventing them from promoting it? Aside from a couple of articles written by MS employees that were pointed to in the comments of JG's post, where is the section at MSDN that talks about NUnit? MBUnit? Rhino Mocks?</p>
