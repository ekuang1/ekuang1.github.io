message: <p>Microsoft just doesn't understand open source.  They use <a href="http://codeplex.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="codeplex.com">codeplex.com</a> in many cases as nothing more than a place to advertise and download... For instance the SQL hosting toolkit has no source code.  It does 95% of what I want, but there's one thing I'd like to see it do somewhat differently and I can't do it.  So I'm forced to write my own from scratch if i want that.<br>Sigh...<br></p>
