message: <p>Years ago I worked on a project with a "tester" that wasn't actually part of the development team.. If I recall correctly, he was a customer advocate/liaison (it was an internal project for another group in the organization), but he made a good tester since he could break it quickly and expose any front-end bugs.  Since he wasn't limited by the mindset of the development team's expectations of "how it is _suppose_ to be used", he would usually try things unexpected and trigger outcomes that weren't handled right in the code. Effectively it was like getting User Acceptance Testing through out the development cycle (not just the end).</p>
