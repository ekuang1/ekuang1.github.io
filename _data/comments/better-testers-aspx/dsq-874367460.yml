message: <p>Some companies (I can think of a telecom or two, but won't embarrass them) consider testing to be an entry level position for developers!  So, they start out as 2nd class citizens in the culture.<br>I have great respect for testers, and recognize they have a different mind-set from developers. In my view they like to "break things". To me this is the mark of a good tester. They can teach developer how to be more effective testers of their own code, and should be encouraged to. They bring a lot to the table.</p>
