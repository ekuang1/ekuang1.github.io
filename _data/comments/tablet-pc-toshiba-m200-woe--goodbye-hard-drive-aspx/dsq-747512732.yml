message: <p>Phil,<br><br><br><br><br><br>Based on the quoted material that you received with the PC, it appears clear that you have a limited warranty.  Toshiba should be responsible for Tiger Direct sending Toshiba's 1-year warranty materials (after all, it allows Tiger Direct to sell its computers).   But seriously, it is hard to believe Tiger Direct removed the 90 day warranty pamphlet and replaced it with 1-year warranty pamphlet.  <br><br><br><br>If you don't get anywhere with customer service, write the president of Toshiba, include a photocopy of the warranty language, and ask for redress.  (I have seen this strategy work for different people, including letters my Dad has written to Nissan and Chrysler regarding their warranties).<br><br><br><br>If all else fails, you can sue - but you won't likely get anywhere (i.e. the cost of litigation is higher than the damages) unless you can find an attorney who will do this as a class action.  By the way, the battery on my old Gateway kept failing in law school.  Last month, I got a letter saying I was entitled to cash or a voucher for a discount off a new Gateway because someone had won a class action over defective Gateway batteries.<br><br><br><br></p>
