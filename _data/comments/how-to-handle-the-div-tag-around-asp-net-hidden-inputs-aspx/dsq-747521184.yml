message: <p>@Ben Rogers<br>I cannot personally see how the &lt;div&gt; tag can be semantically neutral. Although I see the argument, (X)HTML is a language and thus all tags carry inherent and semantic meaning. <em>It's all a question of semantics I guess</em>. I don't agree that an INPUT tag which is hidden needs to be put in a div for it to be semantically valid, it is of course hidden from the user and thus can be anywhere on the page as far as the user is concerned. While there are limited/no operational semantics involved in the use of a &lt;div&gt; tag, from a linguistic point of view a &lt;div&gt; tag defines a division or section of the page, and the &lt;body&gt; tag can be viewed as a &lt;div&gt; tag loaded with semantics. That the &lt;input&gt; is in the &lt;body&gt; should be therefore be enough for us, in my opinion.<br>I admit that it is a bit retentive to look at it that way, but if you have no hidden inputs, from many presentational perspectives the &lt;div&gt; becomes empty, and as the &lt;div&gt; cannot be type=hidden the same way the same way the inputs are. So, I can see why it was put in. But it would be nice to have the option to leave it out.</p>
