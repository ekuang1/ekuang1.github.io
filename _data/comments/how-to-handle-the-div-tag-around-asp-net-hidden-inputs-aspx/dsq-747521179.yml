message: <p>@Ben - Why should the <em>semantically neutrality</em> of the DIV allow it to be injected willy nilly? Is being <em>Semantically Neutral</em> enough?<br><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.5.4" rel="nofollow noopener" title="W3C HTML Spec">Section 7.5.4 of the W3C Recommendation</a> defines DIV content to be block-level.<br>Isn't it reasonable to say this imparts a bit of semantics to the DIV. In other words, if the DIV were truly semantically neutral, would it not be interchangeable with the SPAN? It is not, which hints that there is some semantic meaning to each element.<br>The spec also points out that there is a common visual representation for the DIV.<br></p><blockquote>Visual user agents generally place a line break before and after DIV elements, for instance:</blockquote><p><br>So while the semantics of the DIV may remain neutral in the sense of how it describes my content, by default, it does affect the layout of my content.<br>So you almost had me convinced to retract that point, but I'm going to stick by it for now unless you blow my argument out of the water. ;)</p>
