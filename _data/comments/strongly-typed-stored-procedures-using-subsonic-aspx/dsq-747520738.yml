message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Thank you for your blog. Im sure it has been very helpful to a lot of people.<br>I do have a question about subsonic's ability to generate stored procs... our db is segregated into multiple schemas and we also had the stored procs generated.  an example of a stored proc in our db is named people.Employee_Insert<br>when i check on the code that was generated by subsonic, it only uses 'Employee_Insert' as the name of the stored proc, thus generating an error saying the stored proc cannot be found.  <br>I would like to know if there is any way to configure sonic.exe to include the schema name of the stored proc when it does its generation.<br>I appreciate you help in this one..<br>thanks,</p>
