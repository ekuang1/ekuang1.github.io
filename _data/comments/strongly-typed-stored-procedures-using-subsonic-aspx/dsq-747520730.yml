message: "<p>Excellent work on the SubSonic project mate but I think that you're giving Stored Procedures a bad name. Sure they have been mis-used and will continue to be misused but they have there place and saying your 'stuck' with them make them sound like legacy stuff you should try and steer clear of.<br>The rails movement has gained great traction because it took one more person out of the stack needed to build an application but it has rendered the DB almost defunct by reducing it to nothing more than a persistence medium.<br>DB offer lots of power and moving or copying that power fully or partially to the 'middle' teir should be thought about carefully. <br>A key place where SPs are great is in complex updates theat have to happen on the server atomicly. If the transaction is managed from the client end the overheads are higher, network partitioning can cause lockups and the intent of an application gets smeared across physical and execution boundries.<br>I guess what I'm saying is: don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>"
