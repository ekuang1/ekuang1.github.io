message: <p>Phil,<br>Nice post. Like you said, very similiar to Rob's video - and although video's are sometimes good for quick tutorials, I don't think they always work well for displaying code tutorials. Having it here in text will be beneficial.<br>I'm working on weekly SubSonic tutorials over at <a href="http://scribesonic.com/Blog/Category/SubSonic.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://scribesonic.com/Blog/Category/SubSonic.aspx">scribesonic.com</a>.<br>This week I'm actually covering strongly typed params using subsonic as I segway into using the Query Tool. (Not published yet though.)<br>There should be a repository somewhere on one of the many subsonic sites (rob's blog, subsonic forums, subsonic codeplex, google code) for tutorial posts like yours and mine, and others.<br>Keep it up!</p>
