message: <p>Dmitry is sunk (and I really feel bad for the guy). Even if he gives it away and asks for donations I still think most folks will go with WLW.<br>Now that MS has entered the desktop posting tool party they'll always <strike>mimic</strike> manage to stay one step ahead, and as long as they are giving it away there won't be any competition. Even if they were to charge 20 bucks for it they'd come out way ahead.<br>It doesn't matter what the competition does now to make their products more viable, MS will clone it and include it. Normally I'd be somewhat miffed at MS for doing something like this, but hey, all's fair...</p>
