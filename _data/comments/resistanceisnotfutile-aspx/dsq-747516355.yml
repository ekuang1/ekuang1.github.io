message: <p>Some of the examples I gave:<br>Vault and other source control products (vs. VSS)<br>Diff programs like Beyond Compare, Araxis Merge<br>EditPad Pro (the Atwood favorite over piles of good, free notepad replacements)<br>The important thing is to differentiate and leverage the fact that Microsoft has to please the masses. Dmitry has a user base and years of consumer feedback. He needs to focus on doing things Microsoft wouldn't or couldn't think of doing:<br>Integrate with Technorati?<br>Integrate with Flickr?<br>Leverage Google / Yahoo / Amazon services?<br>Upsell by offering enhanced services?<br>Add advanced features that Microsoft wouldn't dare for fear of confusing Joe User?<br>Make use of open source libraries or products that Microsoft legal would squash?<br>Open sourcing portions of the product could free him up to work on differentiators. There are enough users that he could possibly spin off some core features as plugins, let users contribute to and enhance those, and focus on value adds.<br>Or, he can always ride it out (like the Corel Office Suite) and start on his next big thing.</p>
