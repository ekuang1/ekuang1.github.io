message: <p>@ Haacked -- that's just it -- Microsoft DOESN'T have to please the masses -- in this case at any rate. Exposing an API for Writer is several nails in the coffin for BlogJet i fear.<br>The paint in the announcement had not dried before there were already plugins to do precisely some of the things BlogJet doesn't do.<br>And that right there is the beauty of it... The development community will plug the holes in Writer. Feature for feature Writer will catch up with and pass BlogJet sooner rather than later</p>
