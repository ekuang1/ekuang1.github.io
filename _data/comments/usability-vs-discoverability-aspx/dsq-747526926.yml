message: <p>I understand that ASP.NET MVC is not ready for prime-time, but as a developer just getting into the framework now (beta), I have to express my disappointment that you're going forward with the anonymous-classes-n√©e-JavaScript-dictionaries strategy.<br>Let me explain, I've done my fair share of JavaScript development using script to do the heavy-lifting in UI view developement.  It has a place there.  Clientside Web UI code tends to be tightly bound in a works-just-here-and-dont-mind-the-magic kind of way.<br>MVC and Routing are not the same.  You're building this technology in an environment where companies pay real money for developers to use Visual Studio and it's spectacular Intellisense capabilities.  The ability to "type three characters and press up, up, up, down, enter" is an astounding productivity boost.  However, in MapRoutes(), I'm lost without spending my afternoon searching StackOverflow, your blog, other people's blogs about older preview versions, source code, and Red Gate's Reflector before I can understand sorta-kinda what I'm supposed to pass and how it will interact with other routes for an even slightly complex case (e.g., "/foo/1/bar/2/baz").<br>I hope that you seriously reconsider this dynamic-language-work-alike hack (in the clever hacker sense of the word) before releasing publicly.  Yes, it's a neat use of the language. Yes, one-liner's are sweet.  But, No, I won't type less than in a designed-for-Intellisense API. And, No, it's not easy to grok. And for goodness sakes, please consider the affects of this coding style on the wider community of developers.<br>I'm sure you've studied how C# for each loops are implemented? With a brute force duck typing sort of approach? Back in 2007 [1], Krzysztof Cwalina was expressing a desire for a notation to support the concept.  How about instead of dumping this onto the  general C#/VB.NET web development community as a legitimate technique ("but Microsoft releases supported APIs that do it this way!"), you work with the Framework Guidelines team to get a verifiable notation down.<br>I know it'd be C# 4.0, I can wait.<br>[1] <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/archive/2007/07/18/DuckNotation.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/archive/2007/07/18/DuckNotation.aspx">blogs.msdn.com/.../DuckNotation.aspx</a></p>
