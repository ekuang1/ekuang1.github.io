message: <p>Firstly, why is constraints not a read only property?  Is there a semantic difference between constraints being null or an empty collection?<br>Secondly, I don't get why you can't use overloads - one which takes an IRouteConstraint and one which takes a string.  In the string version you can convert the string to an IRouteConstraint and call the other overload.<br></p>
