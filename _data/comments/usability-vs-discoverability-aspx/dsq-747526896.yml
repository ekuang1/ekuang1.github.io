message: <p>"weâ€™ve added a bit of friction for those who are just starting out and have trouble using Google"<br>Apart from being slightly insulting towards a respeced member of the .NET community I think this statement is incorrect. I have found Google nearly useless when it comes to Asp.Net Mvc. There is very little information out there and most of tends to be out of date. I have better luck directly searching Scott Gu / Haacked / Hanselman. I look forward to the official release so that all the books will finally ship.</p>
