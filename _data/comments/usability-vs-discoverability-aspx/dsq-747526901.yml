message: <p>I didn't get the joke, I am afraid.<br>As for the API discoverability issue.<br>Change IRouteConstraint to AbstractRouteConstraint (you like to do that anyway) and define an implicit convertion operator from string to AbstractRouteConstraint.<br>That will let you define constraints as an enumerable AbstractRouteConstraint. so you can write it like:<br>new AbstractConstraint[] { @"\d4", new MyCustomConstraint()}</p>
