When I say<br></p><blockquote><p>However, I would like to hit up that MVP conference in Redmond before doing anything to cause my MVP status to be dropped.</p></blockquote><p><br>I don't mean I <strong>will</strong>. I'll still speak my mind. I'm just hoping Microsoft doesn't do anything worthy of a bitch slap until <strong>after</strong> the conference (or again for that matter). ;)</p>
