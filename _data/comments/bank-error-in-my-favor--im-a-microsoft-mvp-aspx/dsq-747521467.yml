message: <p>@Scott - Heh heh. When I said this:<br></p><blockquote><p>What does it mean to be a Microsoft MVP? Iâ€™m not really fully sure yet.</p></blockquote><p><br>That was more what I had in mind. It was a philosophical question, not a question of benefits. What is the <em>practical</em> effect of being an MVP.<br>I've never been hesitant to speak my mind before in criticizing (and praising) Microsoft. However, I would like to hit up that MVP conference in Redmond before doing anything to cause my MVP status to be dropped. ;)</p>
