message: <p>Back to the movie... I saw it this afternoon.  I wish I could say that I'm happy, but after being pounded by two hours of institutional greed, death, and hypocrisy... I'm in a bit of a foul mood.  I was expecting to laugh more, but the subject matter was much more focused on our soldiers and Iraqi civilians than I had expected.  Their deaths and suffering are hard to dispute, or feel good about.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps the most uplifting part of the movie is Neil Young singing "Rockin' in the Free World" as the credits roll... and wondering what can be done about all of this.</p>
