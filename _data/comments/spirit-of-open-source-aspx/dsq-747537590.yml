message: <p>To give this another spin:<br>An (active) Open Source project that only gives and never takes "anything" back, does not acknowledge the "value" of it's users. Those that work to extend and enhance the very project you released. You don't acknowledge your community if you don't take back.<br>Why would you allow your users to modify the software you release, in order to never acknowledge the fact that they changed it or modified it. Well maybe you do in other ways, but the only direct acknowledgement is taking back source contributions.(This is an extreme example, because open source projects usually do take back from community even if it's just borrowing ideas from derivative works)<br>Is it still open source if you never take back contributions? That's a definitive yes!. Is never taking back contributions in the spirit of open source? That's almost a definitive no!<br>Taking back is not an requirement defined anywhere, it's just an widely encountered expectation.</p>
