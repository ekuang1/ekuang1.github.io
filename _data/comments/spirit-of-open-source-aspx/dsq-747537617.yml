message: <p>It seems to me that this "open development" requirement is something new. In fact I'd never seen anyone really complain about it until Android came along. I'd see people talk about the difficulty in getting to work on Debian and some other projects. It appears to be a way to lash out at large corporations that some may feel are "using" open source for publicity. And thats why you now have people saying things like "its open source but not open" or "its only kinda open" or "its not really open" despite what the license says. <br>But this doesn't make sense because of one of the points you brought up. As long as the code is released under a license that permits anyone can take and form an open development community around it. And thats what open source in my mind was always about. I could change code to suit my needs and if others needed the same things we could come together and develop a fork. So all of this new talk of needing to be able to contribute to the parent project is rather ridiculous to me.</p>
