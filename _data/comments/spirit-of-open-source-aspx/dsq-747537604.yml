message: <p>I think an OS license is the price to play. You don't get to release source code and call it open source. We need to know that if we take it, you won't slap us for taking a cookie from the cookie jar(IE-we utilize the 4 freedoms). <br>You can do just that, and I will agree your code is OS. But you are missing the real point and idea of an open source project(eg, title of this article). You want to foster community and utilize that fast-feedback loop that comes with working in the light of day.  <br>It's a darn shame that MVC doesn't fully utilize it, but it's all about baby steps I guess. I hope that folks behind that project(which I think seem pretty cozy to NuGet) can really push to a more community oriented development process. <br>As an aside, I've been following NuGet since 1.0 and it makes me very excited to see the blossoming community that accompanies the project which embodies the spirit of open source.</p>
