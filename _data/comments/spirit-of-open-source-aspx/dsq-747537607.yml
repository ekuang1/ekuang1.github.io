message: <p>Okay, I keyed in on RMS and his open source communism in my first comment. Certainly there are the philosophical warriors like RMS, but I have always considered (projected? hoped?) that the spirit of the open source community is "we like to build neat stuff for our own sake and for the fun of it."<br>Btw, I think software should be either proprietary (hidden or published source -- take your pick) or public domain.  The GPL, LGPL, and BSD-like licenses all imply either a disdain for intellectual/private property or a need on the part of the authors for ego stroking. If the project is worth it then it will thrive in the public domain, like SQLite.</p>
