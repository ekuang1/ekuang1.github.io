message: <p>I disagree with the idea that an open source project is obligated in some way to accept contributions. Yes, it is nice if people can contribute, but there are lots of reasons why I might reject a patch (I have a blog post brewing on this). I learned this the hard way after accepting all the patches that came along on one of my projects and finding that they often introduced major bugs that I had to fix myself. Also I had people moaning on the forums that there was no documentation about these features, and the submitter of a patch rarely if ever sticks around on the forums to support people with the feature they have added. In short I have become a lot more cautious about accepting contributions.<br>Then I have plenty of other open source projects that I just put out there to share my work, but am no longer actively maintaining them. I simply have no time or motivation to accept contributions. Given how easy it is to create public forks these days, I don't see that there is any problem that I might not be accepting further changes.</p>
