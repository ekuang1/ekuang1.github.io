message: <p>HACKER!<br>Sorry, couldn't resist name calling after all that "don't name call me", it's a fault I know.<br>Seriously though, I actually found this article really helped clear some things up in my own thinking.  Especially as I move to OS some of our internal projects.<br>I like the idea that I don't 'have' to accept contributions - which could break our enterprise usage - but that I can still contribute to the community as a whole, at least with some code samples, and working code that 'works for us so may be useful for you'.<br>I also like the idea of crowd sourcing to 'improve my products' but am interested to see how the cost/benefit works out.  Where supporting and engaging in that community is a clear cost - does it really outweigh the potential benefits?  I hope it does, and it certainly seems to on bigger active projects, but the jury is out for now.</p>
