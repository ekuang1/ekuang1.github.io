message: <p>IMHO, the term "Open Source Project" should refer to the project itself (i.e. the open and collaborative development of the software), vs. "Open Source Software" which should refer to finished product (i.e. the rights of the user regarding the software, and it's source code). How can a 'Project' be open source, and not accept contributions? The software can be open source, and the [finished] source code can be open source, but the 'Project' should not be considered 'Open' unless it accepts contributions. That said, I don't think that current definitions of these terms agree with me. Perhaps the definitions of these terms should be 're-thunk'.</p>
