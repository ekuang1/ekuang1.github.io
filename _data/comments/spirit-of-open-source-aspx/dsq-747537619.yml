message: '<p>@CMike: <br></p><blockquote>The GPL, LGPL, and BSD-like licenses all imply either a disdain for intellectual/private property or a need on the part of the authors for ego stroking</blockquote><p><br>I do not think that these licenses imply a disdain for intellectual property (whatever IP really means: Copyright? Patents? All of these?). I would say, it is exactly the opposite: When someone violates a GPL license, this person is breaking copyright laws, and shows therefore him/herself a disdain for "intellectual property".<br>About "ego stroking": What is wrong with wanting to be identified with your own work, that you give to the community on your terms?<br></p><blockquote>I think software should be either proprietary (hidden or published source -- take your pick) or public domain.</blockquote><p><br>Nobody prevents you from doing that with your source - you may even release your code on your own terms, e.g. a (constructed) Christian License, that forbids users to run your software during church hours on Sundays and holidays.<br>Now to the "spirit" of Open Source: IMHO, it is "just" the licenses, but that is a big deal in itself.</p>'
