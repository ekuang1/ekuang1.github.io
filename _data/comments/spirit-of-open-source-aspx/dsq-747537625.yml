message: <p>I totally agree with david, mvc really is a toss over the wall in regards to open source. Lot's of questions  regarding Microsoft's open source commitment can be asked from just looking at the past. Im referring to projects such as IronRuby, IronPython, Irony and such. Even Mono, which is such a beautiful and committed product needs to do it largely by themselves, and porting libraries have been difficult due to licenses issues.  Yes, <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc is now open source. Good work, but why not host it on Github? Github is now the defacto standard for almost every open source developer. Because Codeplex is Microsoft's thing? Even when their is something as superior as Github  and with a huge demand from the OS community, still choose for their own code hosting environment.  Open source, is not just spitting your code out in public or slapping a license on it. It's commitment and passion to improve and help and work together to make things better, even if that means killing your darlings from time to time. <br>If there is something I've learned from developing for Microsoft the last 10 years, is that they really don't look around at the innovative things that are being done in the OSS world but rather want to invent the square wheel themselves and over architect things.<br>Even after all these years, we still don't have such a complete and coherent development environment as in Rails or Node.js. Where's the Capistrano, Capybara, Tilt, Rack and other brilliant frameworks? For the most part I love C# as a programming language. But the lack of good productive frameworks make me switch to OSS whenever i am not working for enterprise clients.</p>
