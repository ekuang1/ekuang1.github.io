message: "<p>@Cmike, regarding this comment: </p><blockquote>The GPL, LGPL, and BSD-like licenses all imply either a disdain for intellectual/private property or a need on the part of the authors for ego stroking.</blockquote><p><br>I assume you when you say disdain for IP, you're talking about the GPL. And when you talk about ego stroking, you're referring to BSD-like licenses.<br>But I don't think BSD like licenses are about ego-stroking. That may be a motivator for some, but the BSD and like licenses also provide protections for those licensing the software. For example, they make it clear that there is no warranty provided with the software and many include clauses so that if a user of the software were to bring a patent claim against them, the license is immediately revoked.<br>I think all of these licenses show a clear respect for IP. A copyright holder is the owner of the content he or she creates and has *every* right to release that content under terms they want. These licenses are clear expressions of that right by spelling out clearly what you can and cannot do with the software. This delineation of rights is the privilege of the copyright holder.<br>A copyright holder can also choose not to give out licenses to the source. But when they do, it's nice to be able to clearly define the conditions in doing so.</p>"
