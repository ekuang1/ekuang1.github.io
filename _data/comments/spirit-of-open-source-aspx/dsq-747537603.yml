message: "<p>I thought the \"spirit of open source\" was the philosophical rejection of the concept of intellectual property and that \"proprietary is immoral.\" Isn't this precisely what RMS asserts when he says \"all software should be free?\"  <br>I have another freedom to consider: my FREEDOM to profit from the fruits of my intellect.  I am not opposed to eventually giving away my work, but the ability to profit from closed source software provides financial resources to drive further innovation.  If DOS or Windows had been \"free\" would we have Microsoft Office, Windows NT, .NET, or myriad other technologies which Microsoft has provided over the years?  How about Apple? Woz wanted to give away the specs to the Apple; Jobs made a profitable business of it (twice!) which created the conditions which support really smart people doing really creative and innovative work.  How about Google?  They use \"free\" software but they don't give away their recipe for how to build a search engine just like theirs.  Or the source code for Gmail. Or Google Docs.  Is that so evil?<br>Give away your software in the name of freedom if that's what makes you happy: just don't force your warped sense of morality on me and tell me I cannot produce proprietary code or that I shouldn't profit from it.</p>"
