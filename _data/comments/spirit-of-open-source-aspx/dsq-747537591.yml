message: <p>I agree 100% that Open Source is about the freedom not the development methodology.  I blogged about this same issue in 2007 and the arguments haven't changed much in the last 5 years.  Ultimately, people on the outside of a project want more control and access and they use the "Open Source" argument as a way to try and gain that access.<br>Projects should feel free to organize their development in a manner that works for the project team.  If they are comfortable with Waterfall methodology, and have proven that it works for them, why should they change?  If they have an Open Source project that used a closed development methodology, and have proven that it works for them, why should they change?  Just because the community likes or wants a different development methodology doesn't mean the project should change.  Teams need to find what works for them and stick with it.  People on the outside of projects rarely have the complete picture and don't understand all the factors which are driving the use of a certain development methodology.</p>
