message: <p>If you want an example of a project that uses “open and collaborative development” but is not FOSS, take a look at DMD <a href="https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd">https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/dmd</a><br>For legal/legacy reasons it will likely never be released under a FOSS licence, but the full source code is available and much or most of the recent development has been via collaborative modes.</p>
