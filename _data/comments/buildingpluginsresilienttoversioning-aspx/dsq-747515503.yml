message: <p>Bah - I never remember to check comments. Now the thread has moved on to a new post and I've really lost my window for replying. Nevertheless. :) <br>In the case where two plugins implement a method that only one should handle, maybe you're better off going with events. :) But there's also nothing wrong with an occasonal NotImplementedException or two - it really depends on the particular situation. <br>Also, there's nothing wrong with using abstract bases in conjunction with events. This is similar to how HttpModules work, whereby an Init method is implemented by all plugins, but after that events are used to hook up to particular points in the pipeline. IHttpModule is obviously an interface, but it could be an abstract base. <br>I guess what I'm saying is that events look appropriate for "sometimes yes, sometimes no" things, and when more than one "listener" might hook the same event. My work has tended to look more like chains of interceptors than groups of listeners, and in that case an abstract base is a pretty good metaphor.</p>
