message: <p>Dimitri, I am still not convinced. The host still decides what is allowed to run and what is not by choosing to raise the event or not.  A self-subscription plugin only has power to execute code if the event it subscribes to is raised in the first place.<br>Think of it this way, an event handler is just another way for the application to call a method on the plugin, albeit indirectly via what is analogously a function pointer.</p>
