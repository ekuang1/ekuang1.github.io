message: "<p>It would be good to know what's ASP.NET's long-term strategy for context-sensitive escaping. Are we going to have different opening tags for different contexts? Will ASP.NET vNext break backwards compatibility and make the implementation of &lt;%: context-aware?<br>Many people have raised this issue already, would it be possible to quickly comment on that please? It would be much appreciated.<br>Thanks,<br>Borek</p>"
