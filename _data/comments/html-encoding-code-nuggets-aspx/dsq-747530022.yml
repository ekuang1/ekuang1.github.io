message: <p>This is nice, but I think this is the only explicitly HTML-targeted feature in the forms engine (which can actually be used to output XML, JSON, text, etc).<br>Maybe something like IEscapedString with IsEscapedFor(useCase) would be better? With HtmlString being one implementation and HtmlAttributeString, XmlString, etc -- other variants.</p>
