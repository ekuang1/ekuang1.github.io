message: <p>Code reviews are indeed a good practice. There are those who don't see the worth (bad experience, perhaps?), but I've seen firsthand how code reviews + test driven development + instrumentation can make a gigantic impact on the quality of the released software. <br>Of course, if you're a lone star, or code in your underwear, then maybe finding a good code reviewer isn't an option!<br>Anyway, thanks Mr. Haack for yet another great read...</p>
