message: <p>The thing is, "bug driven development" is the most simple and straightforward one. Its a lot associated with experience too, the more experienced one gets, the less bugs he does (but it also depends on the language, and whether it supports certain coding schemes or not)<br>So i can understand everyone who is sceptical, no matter how many OTHERS are persuaded that their model is better. :)<br>I think however there should be some kind of contest. A fair contest, where we would measure different techniques with a somewhat similar "reallife usage case" (and it should be a quite complex problem too and the programmers involved should have some years experience too)</p>
