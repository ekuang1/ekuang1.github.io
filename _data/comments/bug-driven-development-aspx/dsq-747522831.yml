message: <p>With all of this talk of eliminating bugs, in my opinion, the best way to do this is to pair program and have mandatory code reviews. This way, younger developers are continually in check and they learn coding styles from more seasoned devs. Code reviews should be mandatory regardless.  If you have trouble getting the company to buy off with TDD, then good luck with XP. I cannot stand when businesses try and cut corners with software.</p>
