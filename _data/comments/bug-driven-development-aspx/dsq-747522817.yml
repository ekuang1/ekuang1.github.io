message: <blockquote>Even if TDD eliminates 75% of the bugs – and how likely is that – the situation is qualitatively the same. You still need to expose the product to testers and field users – “Bug-Driven Development.”</blockquote><p><br>So, when the user types in X, Y information should be displayed. Oh, heck, did I just write a test? Geez, I thought we weren't going to use that useless Test Driven stuff on this project.</p>
