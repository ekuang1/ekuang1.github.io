message: <p>don't get me wrong. this is a nice demo, but I'd really like MVC 4 to have a way to support html5 server side events or some sort of comet protocol. I really don't see anyone doing that in any major way. No matter what though, I always look to have MVC and ASP.NEt in general make the hard stuff easy, and the easy stuff trivial<br></p>
