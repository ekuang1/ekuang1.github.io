message: <p>To my experience, the kind of generalization you speak of works best in certain junction points of your software. For example, a factory pattern works well when applied to major replaceable components, but it's completely redundant to spawn instances of every class using a factory. In general, design patterns can't replace foresight, and foresight is achieved from experience.</p>
