message: <p>Indeed, a lot of the abuse that is done using Microsoft technologies happen because of the abuse of the *samples* provided by Microsoft. <br>I believe that the belief that there is such a thing as a "standard" membership provider comes with the fact that most examples are written using that standard -- usually the SqlMemberShip provider that connects, not to a SQL Server 2005 database, but a SQL Server Express 2005 database at that.<br>Perhaps there's really a need to not only educate the Microsoft developer masses beyond Microsoft samples, but make them aware that there are ways of doing things outside of that "sample space".</p>
