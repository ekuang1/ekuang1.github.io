message: "<p>Have a look at Phil's earlier post <a href=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2006/04/04/CoCommentSupportInSubtext.aspx#feedback\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2006/04/04/CoCommentSupportInSubtext.aspx#feedback\">here</a> for a little more info. The basic premise behind it is to be able to track your comments in one centralized place. I've had some fun with it, but to be honest unless the adoption rate skyrockets (or the guys over at coco can work some kind of magic and lower the bar to entry) I'm afraid it might not last. Well, it'll probably last, but won't be the next Technoratti.<br>The problem is 2 fold: A) to use it you have to have an account and B) the blog owner has to implement the Coco service on their site (well, the big names are supported out of the box, like typepad, WP, etc...but most tech blogs run on some other flavor of blogging software). I'm sure Phil could come up w/ some sort of math equation stating how this will logarithmically taper off as time goes on...but I'll leave that up to him ;-).</p>"
