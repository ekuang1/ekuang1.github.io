message: "<p>Amen. I dropped in the summit in 2010, shortly after I joined the company, and was completely turned off by a frequent attitude of entitlement. There are absolutely great people who deserve the recognition, but clearly there's a subsample who contribute to the community for the recognition and feel entitled. Worse, they're rude jackasses to product people.<br>It creates an interesting problem, because it's not logical to drop the whole program on the basis of a few bad apples, but the annual drama online from people who don't get their pat on the back is getting old.<br>I tend to feel good about contributors with high StackOverflow scores, or MSDN/TechNet reputation scores (disclaimer: I worked on the latter system). Granted, those measures are narrowed to specific communities, but to me we really need to identify people both as a thank you and as a way for others to understand who is an A-level information contributor.</p>"
