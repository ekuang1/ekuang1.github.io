message: <p>The MVP program has distilled over the years. When I was first an MVP it was really rewarding, both from token compensation to recognition and above all, networking and openess with product teams and MVP peers. That has changed over the years. The MVP program is a shadow of it's former self. These reverberations people are seeing each award cycle have been going on for a year or two now and we haven't seen the last of it.</p>
