message: <p>Personally I think the MVP program is great.  People to misuse it though and put too much emphasis on the fact that they're an MVP.<br>Also just pulling you up on this statement;<br>"A yearly summit where theyâ€™re flown in to meet with product teams"<br>Microsoft doesn't fly anyone in.  People cough up the money from their own pockets.  What Microsoft do do is pay for your accommodation if you stay with another MVP.</p>
