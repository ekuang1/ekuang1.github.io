message: <p>Dan, I think that's another interesting aspect of the MVP program. It's not consistent among group to group. I think many folks have pointed out in various discussions how much they like the way the ASP.NET team handles MVPs.<br>I may be biased, but I think Hanselman gets community and does a great job there. As does my former boss, Scott Hunter. We tried to include MVPs in a bunch of product group interactions (live meetings) etc.<br>The sad truth though, is unless all the groups are held to that high standard, it hurts the image of the entire program.<br>I've enjoyed my interactions with MVPs both from the inside and outside. But as many pointed out, hopefully we can create more opportunities for that sort of interaction as a community.</p>
