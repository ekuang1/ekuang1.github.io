message: <p>Nice post, Phil.<br>One thing I have noticed over the last few years is that when there are rumblings about the fairness of the MVP program and how recipients are chosen is that it is usually from the development community. I don't recall seeing any uproar around SQL Server MVPs, Office MVPs, SharePoint MVPs, etc. Either I am just out of touch with those groups or there could be some connection to the source of the problem.<br>I think that Rob E. and others have a point that developer contributions to the community are more difficult to quantify. There are many influential devs to don't contribute in forums, on blogs or by speaking. Including open source contributions when evaluating candidates for the award would be a big step forward, IMO.<br>I also agree that dev tools (and the MSDN subscription) are another source of the angst. I don't see this as something that would be unique to the developer MVPs though. SQL Server is one of the more pricey products in the MSDN and TechNet subscriptions.<br>I feel that the MVP leads and others who run the program mean well and are not conspiring to exclude OSS contributors. A few tweaks to how contributions are measured could do a world of good.</p>
