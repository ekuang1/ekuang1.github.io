message: <p>Isn't it fine to have more than one motive for pursuing something? It seems reasonable that someone could be answering questions on stackoverflow because they want to share their knowledge but also because they want to be praised for their intelligence. But still do it because they are competitive and want to have a high score. I became a programmer because I was obsessed with solving problems but I also did it for the money and for the women :-)</p>
