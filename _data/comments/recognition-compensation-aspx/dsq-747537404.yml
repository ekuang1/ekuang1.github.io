message: "<p>One of the main problems with the MVP title it's coming from it's name: \"MOST Valuable Professional\" - many people assume it's about the BEST professional in a certain area, even if it's nothing like that: currently today an MVP is somebody who managed to make itself the most visible in the communities (online or offline) that are monitored and \"accepted\" by the local Microsoft branch, and who managed to develop good relationships with somebody from Microsoft in order to get noticed..<br>It's well known that some MVPs are advise to \"avoid\" certain programming communities that are not \"blessed\" by the local Microsoft branch for certain reasons (like having a critical view on some MS products, or not accepting to play by the MS marketing department agenda).<br>That's why many developers now disregard that MVP award: even if somebody is clearly known by everybody to be more competent in a certain area, somebody else gets the title just because it was more vocal and had better \"networking\" skills.. Sure that there are exceptions, but these are rare these days.</p>"
