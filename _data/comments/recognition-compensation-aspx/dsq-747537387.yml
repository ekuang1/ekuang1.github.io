message: <p>Great post, Phil. Admire the way you reflect your opinions. Personally I encourage the junior developers the same way. Develop and learn for your own, not seek immediate recognition and compensation right away. If you do it right, the rest will follow.<br>I have seen and heard similar sentiments on various venues including the .NET-Rocks podcast hosts. There is so much good great stuff happening on the open community which I am just peeling off myself. Making things work with minimum friction. I have been .NET dev since 2001, but started shifting gears in the last few years while not leaving .NET community. It all complements in many ways. Lots of learning and having fun!<br>There are devs who look at the MVP program as such that they have to have N-number of blogs posts, N-number of speeches in a given year, and answer this &amp; that to be recognized. Your hit it right there. <br>Well done and looking forward to your contributions to Github.</p>
