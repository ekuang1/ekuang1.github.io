message: "<p>I've been an MVP for the past 5 years and I love the program. <br>\"I don’t think it’s inherently wrong for a company to recognize people’s contributions. But it has to be done in a way so that it’s seen as icing and not an entitlement or cronyism.\"<br>That sentence nailed it. I know many people that want to become an MVP for all the wrong reasons: early access, free software, summit, etc, but I always tell them the same thing, help the community because you want to and feel good doing so, the MVP recognition will come when it comes.</p>"
