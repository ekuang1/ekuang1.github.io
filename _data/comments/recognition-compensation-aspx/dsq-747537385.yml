message: <p>"...the means by which compensation is doled out is perceived to be arbitrary and hidden."<br>This is really the main problem I think. If the program had clear criteria, then anyone who is seeking the "compensation" can take specific actions to achieve it (which, if the program is designed well, benefits the community), and those in the community know how much value to place on a potential employee or consultant or blog author's MVP status. Without that clear criteria, it might as well be a roulette wheel, and I therefore have no interest in either seeking an MVP award, or in placing any greater degree of confidence in someone who has it.<br>"...make Visual Studio Professional free, and focus on developing the ecosystem that gets a boost when everyone has better tools to build on your platform. Everyone wins."<br>This. The people who buy the higher SKUs of Visual Studio are the enterprise customers developing primarily for their internal use. The people who buy the lower SKUs or use the free Express editions are the ones developing (often free) products and tools that benefit the entire community, and therefore the entire Microsoft ecosystem. The latter is by far the more valuable group (I say confidently without any supporting evidence), but it is also the group stuck with the lower quality tools.<br>Of course the downside of that approach is that a product that is not seen as a profit center is likely to get squeezed on resources, which would lead to a decline in the quality of the entire product. Not that it has to be that way, but it almost always is.</p>
