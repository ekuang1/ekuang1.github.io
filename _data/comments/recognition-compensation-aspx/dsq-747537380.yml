message: <p>Phil, I think you're exactly right. I've been involved with the ASP.NET, WCF, and Silverlight/Blend groups over the years and they've been outstanding to work with overall. A lot of that's due to people like yourself, Scott Hanselman, Scott Guthrie, Tim Heuer, John Papa, and others making time to involve MVPs, insiders, etc.<br>I know some MVPs who have very little interaction with their product groups though and I can only imagine how frustrating that would be. You (and your group) definitely did an awesome job with the ASP.NET MVC side of things. I think I can speak for everyone else involved and say that we really appreciate all the effort you put into involving everyone as much as possible. I was pretty bummed when I heard you were leaving....I'm over it now though. :-)<br></p>
