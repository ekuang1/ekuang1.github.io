message: <p>I've always felt that the MVP program means well but, because of some of the types of reasons that you've mentioned in your post - and including some equity theory as well - it seems bound to fail.  <br>I hold the MVP program in about the same regard as I hold most committees - they mean well, they often have good intentions, but so often they have a destructive or undesired outcome.<br>I would like to see more agitation in the MVP system.  Perhaps a forced turnover of recipients (which might require some different levels of acknowledgement).  <br>The main benefits I got from my years as an MVP was the opportunities to meet people and make richer connections with different segments of the industry that I would not have otherwise had the opportunity to meet.  I just desire more people to have that opportunity!</p>
