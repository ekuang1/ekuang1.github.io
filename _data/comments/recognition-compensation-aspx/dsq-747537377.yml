message: <p>Great post Phil. You bring up a lot of solid points that I agree with. I really like the "focused recognition" idea. So much has changed over the past 10 years that they need to seriously consider that as well as the "better free tools" idea.<br>I've been involved with the MVP program for several years and I do enjoy being a part of it and think it adds value especially for people that want to be more involved with a specific technology, integrate as much as possible with product groups, and meet people they would've have met otherwise. That's not to say that I haven't been frustrated at times (I have) or that they don't have issues that need to be fixed - they do. But I challenge anyone to name a community group that can't be improved upon or that doesn't have issues especially when you have 1000s of people involved. My experience over the years is definitely much more positive than negative.<br>How they pick people, renew/drop people, etc. definitely could use some work but having known several MVP leads over the years I can definitely say with confidence that they've all been great people trying to do their best. Call me a brown noser, fan boy, whatever, but I've been lucky to have had some great MVP leads that helped me out with getting in touch with people, participating in events, getting up to speed with new technologies, etc. But, I've actively reached out to them and tried to get to know them personally rather than just reading through the emails they send out.<br>The first year I was an MVP it was definitely about the recognition, MSDN subscription (the "compensation" as some like to say), and supposed "increase" in status - I was young and immature then :-). People who feel above others, feel the need to constantly mention their MVP status to everyone, etc. just plain annoy me now. There are many benefits the program offers that have nothing to do with that stuff.<br>The biggest benefit I get from the MVP program is the opportunity to meet directly with developers (inside and outside of Microsoft) that I would've have had a chance to meet otherwise. It's how I first met you actually. It's the community piece that really makes it fun for me as I have a lot of friends I look forward to seeing at the yearly summit from all over the world.<br><br></p>
