message: <p>No matter what, someone will complain. That is just the way it will always be. You are right, developers should not be looking for validation/recognition from Microsoft. However if MS want to give away a few MSDN subscriptions to people they think deserve it, then great for those people who get them.<br>Personally, I would like to see MS give out MSDN subs to devs that contribute packages to NuGet. Developers working in the open for the betterment of the community.</p>
