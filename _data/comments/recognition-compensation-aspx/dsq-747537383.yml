message: "<p>Nice post! I enjoy the manner in which you continue to handle your transition from MS to GitHub with a positive note. I tire of so many ex MS employees promptly going negative after leaving. <br>re: MVP program - I can say that early on it was nice to see the MVP badge when someone was posting instructions or tutorials. While I realize this is no guarantee of infallibility, it DID add some credibility. When one is learning, it is heard to sort the good information from the bad. <br>re: The \"reward\": I agree that any incentive system will ultimately influence the thinking and motivation of those performing the work. I suspect the community would benefit from allowing the incentive to be the recognintion and \"cred\" which may or may not come from MVP recognition. <br>re: MSDN/VS dev tools - MS would DEFINITELY help themselves and the community by making single developer licenses for what we now know as the \"pro\" version of VS free, or at least radically reducing the cost (without some of the restriction which come with, say Website Spark). This is a barrier to entry for most folks, and in some cases may be the reason they end up focused on a different technology (Eclipse is definitely a decent IDE, just takes some getting used to). With the manner in which MS is \"opening up\" much of their ecosystem, a powerful but free version of VS would go a long ways. I mean, VS can't be a profit center for them, right?<br>Thanks for the post. Keep up the good work, I greatly enjoy your blog!</p>"
