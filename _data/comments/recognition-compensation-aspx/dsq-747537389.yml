message: "<p>I'm MVP nine years in row - ever since the program was introduced in my country. And I don't think it's a compensation system. It's nice gesture, but it would be lot more effective from economic point of view to simply buy MSDN Subscription than spent lot of time writing the articles and open source I'm being awarded MVP for.<br>I see (and use) my MVP recognition as a tool for use *inside* Microsoft. When I need something, some information or clarification, it helps being MVP. I think it's because people in MS know that by answering me, they're not helping only me personally, but that I'll spread the knowledge further.<br>Maybe the recognition and \"executive recognition letters\" can do some good in some countries, but here in Czech republic nopbody cares. It won't help me to get a job, won't allow me to charge more etc.<br>Regarding the MVP Summit: I was there several times and amount of actual information related to me was smaller than when I go to TechEd. I wasn't there for last few years, since it's simply not worth the hassle of trans-atlantic travel.<br>And early access to technical information and software? I'm ASP.NET MVP and don't remember being told something in advance. Maybe it works in MVC area, but I do Web Forms and infrastructure things and I get my info from blogs as everyone else.<br>To me, it's not compensation, but a tool.</p>"
