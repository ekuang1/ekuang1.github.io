message: <p>To all who asked about VS10 Beta 2 and ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta, I know it's frustrating for those on VS10 Beta 2 who want to try out the ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta, and I'm sorry for that.<br>The tricky part in all this is that we're trying to hit two different ship trains. Unfortunately, I don't have any control over the VS10 ship schedule, so I can't force them to ship when we ship.<br>Since ASP.NET MVC 2 for VS10 is <em>actually part of VS10</em>, we really didn't want to get in the business of trying to ship parts of VS10 outside of the VS10 schedule. I'm not sure the VS10 team would be happy about that given it could interfere with evaluations of VS10 if we bork the installation.<br>The other option is to simply not ship previews of ASP.NET MVC 2 and wait for each VS10 release for people to get a taste. Obviously that's not the answer, so we didn't do that.<br>If you want to run ASP.NET MVC 2 on VS2008 side by side with VS2010, there is an unsupported at your own risk don't cry to us solution.<br>In Add/Remove programs uninstall the ASP.NET MVC 2 Tools for Visual Studio 2008 and then uninstall the ASP.NET MVC 2 runtime. It's the option that says simply "Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 2". <br>After that, install ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta. This will put the ASP.NET MVC 2 tools in VS10 in a state where they are not in sync with the runtime. We haven't tested this configuration a whole lot so it could also interfere with your ability to uninstall VS10 Beta 2, though I'm not sure if it will or not.<br>Again, we do appreciate you trying out pre-release software as your feedback is very helpful. I hope you are willing to accomodate the pains that often go hand in hand with pre-release software.<br>The situation will be fully resolved by RTM.</p>
