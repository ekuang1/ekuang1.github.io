message: <p>@Phil - regarding VS10b2 and MVCb2, when you say "the tooling for VS10 will be out of sync, as it thinks you have the Preview 2 runtime.", can you please elaborate on what tooling will be out of sync so we know what the pain points will be?  I'm guessing/hopeful it will actually not be that significant to most mvc developers.</p>
