message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I asked the same question, regarding the multi-project Areas support, on the ASP.NET MVC forum:<br><a href="http://forums.asp.net/p/1494640/3520813.aspx#3520813" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://forums.asp.net/p/1494640/3520813.aspx#3520813">forums.asp.net/p/1494640/3520813.aspx#3520813</a><br>Up to this moment there is not a single reply on it.<br>This question is very important to answer for the entire community of supporters of the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC technology stack. Felipe Lima and I, like many others, are worried that there is no clear guidance from the ASP.NET MVC team regarding the multi-project Areas support in the ASP.NET MVC 2 version. This is a strategic infrastructure level question. You, being in capacity of the captain of the product, i.e. Senior Program Manager on the MVC team, would be the best person to provide the guidance and answer the question.<br>Regards,<br>Yitzhak <br></p>
