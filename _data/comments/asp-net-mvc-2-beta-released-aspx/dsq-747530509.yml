message: '<p>Wow...this is a total bummer (from the Release Notes):  "Note  Because Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 share a component of ASP.NET MVC, installing ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta on a computer where Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 is also installed is not supported."<br>Sticking with MVC 2.0 Preview 2 here as well then!</p>'
