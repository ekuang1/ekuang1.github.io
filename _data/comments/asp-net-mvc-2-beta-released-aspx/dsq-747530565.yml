message: <p>I think not "officially" supporting ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta with VS'2010 isn't very smart. A lot of us are working with ASP.NET MVC 2 with VS'2010 and you are essentially abandoning us. Especially when you could just ship a new version of the "ASP.NET MVC 2 Visual Studio 2010 Tools" with the ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta just as you are shipping "ASP.NET MVC 2 Visual Studio 2008 Tools". C'mon guys this just looks lazy from my perspective, especially since both VS'2010 and ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta have Go Live licenses and are both supported separately.</p>
