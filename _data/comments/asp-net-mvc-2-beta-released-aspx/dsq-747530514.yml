message: <p>Any command line domain, controller, view, test generation on the horizon ? (aka. grails)  <br>This speeds up development, rather than right click, create view (replace table with mvccontrib grid), then right click create controller, select domain objects, ad nausum.<br>I see new glitter (good glitter) being added, would like to see it more forward toward 'practical'  :)<br>Happy to see the async-controllers (will make for good publishing to nservicebus!).<br>So - any chance we'll begin to see some scaffolding/domain focused capability in the near future from the team ?<br>Thanks for the updates - good stuff<br><br></p>
