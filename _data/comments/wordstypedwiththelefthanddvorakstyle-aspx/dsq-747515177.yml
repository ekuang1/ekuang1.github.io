message: <p>I never took the DVORAK plunge when my wrists started hurting. I switched to a trackball and a more ergonomic keyboard:<br><a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/images/133-med.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/images/133-med.jpg">http://www.kinesis-ergo.com...</a><br>It has the DVORAK letters painted on it as well as the QWERTY letters so I could switch if I want. Though, I don't want to, since my cruising speed is 80WPM and my sprinting speed is about 110WPM in QWERTY. <br>Funny, as I type this my right wrist started aching...</p>
