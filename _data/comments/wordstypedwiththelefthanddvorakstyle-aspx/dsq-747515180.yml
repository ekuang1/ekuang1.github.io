message: <p>Actually, I believe the longest word you can type with your left hand only on a qwerty keyboard will be stewardess. lol.<br>I've been typing on qwerty since I can remember, and I've recently picked up dvorak. I can switch comfortably between both layouts, and because I've been typing qwerty since I was a baby, my qwerty speed is usually faster than my dvorak speed.<br>However, I still type in dvorak simply because its much more comfortable to type in. My fingers hop around the keyboard less often compared to the qwerty layout. Its a shame that people are still typing on qwerty, really.<br>I'm learning the dvorak left hand layout now. Just for the fun of it. lol.</p>
