message: <p>I agree with Jeff, when i read the opening paragraph I knew exactly how it would render as this is to be expected and is in fact the standard as noted in the comment made by Yuri Khan. In general I would say that modifying the output is mute really as most (if not all) developers are used to these whitespace issues.</p>
