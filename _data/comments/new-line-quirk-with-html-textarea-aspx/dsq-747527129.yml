message: <p>The behaviour seems very normal. I've always written text-areas with the tags on separate lines; same as I do for code blocks, etc.<br>But yes, whitespace is always a tricky issue in HTML/XML. Another interesting behaviour is that comments on their own line have the ability to affect layout!</p>
