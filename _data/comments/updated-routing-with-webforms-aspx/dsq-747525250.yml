message: <p>Hi Phil, when I tried the demo project I had problems accessing the default page. Despite the mapping of "" to "Default.aspx", requests for "/" did not activate the WebFormRouteHandler. Instead, when using the ASP.NET Development Server they returned a 404 error, and when using IIS 7 they reached Default.aspx, but it appeared to be loaded as a standard .aspx page, without a populated RouteData field, causing it error trying to generate the links with this.RouteLink.</p>
