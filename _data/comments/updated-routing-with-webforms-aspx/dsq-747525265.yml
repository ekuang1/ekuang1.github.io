message: <p>Has anyone tried output caching with routing on webforms? I have page Test.aspx with a user control on it the user control is set to use fragment caching varybyparam="id" now I have a route /test/{id}.<br>/test/1 and /test/2 do not give me different versions of the control, am I missing something MVC seems to handle varybyparam fine for action parameters and I see that is using nothing special for caching or am I blind :P??</p>
