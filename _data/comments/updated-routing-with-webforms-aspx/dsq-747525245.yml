message: <p>@Betty in that case, routing wouldn't probably work for you. It's a programmatic technique for responding to requests with a resource. It's like URL rewriting, in a sense, but it's bidirectional and doesn't rewrite. If you don't have access to the source, I'd think you'd want to use a URL rewriting solution at the web server level.</p>
