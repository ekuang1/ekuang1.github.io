message: <p>Today I lost my car keys at work...I had to handcarry something to a customer and right before starting my commute to LA I used the restroom quickly as then walked to my car...well as I approached my car I realized I didn't have my keys...naturally I walked back to the last place I remembered having them...the restroo<br>....but they were not there...so I spent the next 3 hours searching for them...walking from one end to the other in hopes of finding my keys an I never did...they were never turned in n I never found them...so now tomorrow is Sunday n Monday is a holiday n I'm left driving with my spare n thankfully I had a copy of my apartment key in my wallet...today was just a shitty day and I'm so glad its over!!...all I ever really cared about was hiding my car key...replacing that will defenitly cost me a pretty penny!....it's not one of those old school keys...this one has to be replaced by the dealership...sux!!!...what a nightmare!!</p>
