message: <p>Yeah, thats a crummy day, but I had a really shitty day today. First, I was getting a coffee this AM and had my truck with my ATV in the back. So I go to back out and totally couldent see this car right behind me. I hit it of course, lightly, but it scratched the bumper and its gonna cost $2000 for a new one and paint. Then im getting yelled at while at work for a few things that were not my fault, like absolutly nothing to do with me, but I catch all the shit anyway. I hate my job.</p>
