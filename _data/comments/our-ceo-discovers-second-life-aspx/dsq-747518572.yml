message: <p>I invented this thing that could help you guys out for your meetings. It consists of a handset and a base. The base has numbers on it. Everyone who has one of these is assigned a number, and using the numbers on the base, you "dial" the number of someone you know who also has one of these things. In the handset is a microphone as well as a speaker. Hold the speaker to your ear, and when you speak into the microphone, the person you "called" can hear what you say. As well, you can hear what they say. It works really great. Pretty efficient, too. Takes no computing cycles and, I would bet, is faster than you can type.<br>Anyway, let me know what you think. I'm thinking about going nationwide with this thing.</p>
