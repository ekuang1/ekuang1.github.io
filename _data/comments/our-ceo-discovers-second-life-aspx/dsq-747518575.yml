message: <p>What are programmers but problem solvers. How do we separate the good from the great is in how they solved the problem. So we should be talking about what makes a good solution vs a great solution. I think a great solution should be fast,flexible,and easy to maintain. So a good programmer might create an application that is very fast but that nobody can understand or expand on. Great programmers can find the balance :)</p>
