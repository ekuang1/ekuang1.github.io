message: <p>Welcome home neighbor.  You did time it right, sun is shining and the snow is 100-feet deep at Mammoth (okay, maybe a little less).  How did I miss the greatest ski season in decades?<br><br><br><br>Anyways, save some of that sake for me and we'll do dinner when I get back in May.  Keep an eye on Susan for me.<br><br><br><br>Chris</p>
