message: <p>My uber-keyboard (<a href="http://www.fingerworks.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.fingerworks.com">www.fingerworks.com</a>) works on the same principle. It uses arrays of capacitors that change capacitance when there are objects near by, such as fingers. I can do many different gestures with multiple fingers.<br><br><br><br>For example, on my right hand, if I were to pinch together my thumb and forefinger, it will "cut". If I  place my finger and thumb together and spread them apart, it will paste.<br><br><br><br>I can make any combination of any fingers and in any direction and assign them whatever set of keystrokes I want. I use it extensively in Visual Studio (I have gestures for build, start debugging, opening and closing certain windows, etc).<br><br><br><br>This system looked really cool, but it was pressure sensitive which to me would be a problem. My keyboard doesn't rely on pressure, only proximity. However, it can simulate pressure by assuming your finger will flatten out as you press harder, therefor covering more area.<br><br><br><br>I'd like to see a system closer to what you saw in Minority Report where a camera would watch your fingers (gloves with LED's would be fine) and you could simply move them in space. It would give you a true 3D control over your screen.<br><br><br><br>Too bad I've got great ideas and no way of ever seeing them come to fruition ;)</p>
