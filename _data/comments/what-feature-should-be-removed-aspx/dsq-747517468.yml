message: "<p>My thoughts:<br>Article are not usefull, but, I mean, it's just a differenct post type, not very complex to mantain :-)<br>Stats &gt; View: would be nice to have it completed, but there are already a lot of free blog traffic tracking tools (MeasureMap, Analytics, Performancing Metrics) that display a lot of interesting stats... anyway, we already have all the stats collected, and displayied on a per post basis, the stats-view will just be a list of posts sorted by page view :-)<br>I don't think we should remove anything: the recent comments has been a bad management of the release, but, as the more 1000 wordpress plugins demonstrate, people always want new features, what is provided by the standard features is never enough.<br>I think we must have a more simple iteration schedule, add less feature at time, as the mantra \"Release Early, Release Often\", but not remove anything once it has been added, unless something else implemented later replace it.</p>"
