message: "<p>I would remove the Articles.  The difference between an article and a post is that posts appear in your feed and articles don't, right?  I can't think of when I would ever post something that I didn't want to appear in my feed, and if I *did* maybe that would be better served as an attribute for a post: [X] Include post in feed (in fact I think you have that already).  So perhaps I don't understand the difference.  Nevertheless, I'll probably never use it!</p>"
