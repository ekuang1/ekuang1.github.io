message: <p>I would get rid of the following:<br>Galleries - I know lots of people probably use this, but come on. Flickr is so much better and just integrating with it would be much cooler. This would be a huge section you could drop.<br>I agree on Check Page Views, or maybe build in some sort of combined stat view to better see Referrers, Views, etc.<br>I would drop Keywords as well, those always look like spam/advertising to me. <br>I definitely don't use articles very much, but I know many people use them as a way to post things they don't want to go away. (like Hanselman's tools list) Perhaps the best way to get rid of the feature would be to add a checkbox to the post that doesn't publish it to the main feed.</p>
