message: <p>I don't use the article's section either.  No idea what the difference is, and not sure what's up with it.<br>The thing is, once you put a feature in, people will use it.  Unless you have a better alternative, removing it will make those users angry.<br>What you could do is add a feature that would allow people to not use other features.  :)</p>
