message: "<p>For my money, the #1 area to overhaul/remove complexity is in the skins. I did notice that you removed some skins in a previous version, but the cutting ought to continue. I have minor gripes with almost every skin, features exist in some, but not all. I'm sure it is a serious hassle to make changes when you know you have to change 12 skins and test in each accordingly. I would be happy to have a freeze on almost every other feature (especially now that Akismet is implemented) in order to work out skin issues. <br></p>"
