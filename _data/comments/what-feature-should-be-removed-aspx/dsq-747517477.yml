message: <p>I think these are already planned in the roadmap and it's not a feature removal per see, but big changes.<br>But, I would very much like the way the user controls and skins work.<br>I usually like the way the code is structured in .Text/subText. But as for the controls that display the blog itself... I don't know why the original author even thought it was a good idea to define everything in controls, specially using Literal controls to define things like textual content or formatting. Most of the messages and formatted strings should be handled by the UI.<br>So, an approach using data sources that gives the flexibility to really design the pages we want to design would be much better. Also, it would solve a lot of Localization issues in subText. I would not mind removing the current skins architecture even if it meant creating new ones from sratch.<br>Which also makes me suggest to remove all the user strings and message from the code. This also concerns a localization issue, but I am pretty sure that even when speaking English, some people would want to customize some messages and string formats for a couple of things that appear on their blog.</p>
