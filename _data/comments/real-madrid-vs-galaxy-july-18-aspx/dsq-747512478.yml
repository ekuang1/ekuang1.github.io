message: <p>I guess "FOOTBALL" knowledge is in short supply here. For the love of god stop calling it soccer.<br><br><br><br>You will get to see all the madrid stars play together in both matches (Chicago and LA). That is always the case on tour but they will only play 45-60 minutes and then you get the reserves which is normal as it is the pre-season!<br><br><br><br>Now I know that ESPN deportes will show the Chicago match. Does anyone know which TV station in the US will show the LA match (if any?)<br><br><br><br>Thanks<br><br><br><br></p>
