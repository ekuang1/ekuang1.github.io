message: <p>I think the way most of you guys try to portray landon donovan and the rest of the mls shows your ignorance about the sport of soccer. Now im not saying that the mls is nearly as good as any top european league but it has made several positive strides since its inception 10 years ago and will only continue to improve with young talent. <br><br><br><br>And for God sakes, Landon is still young and is still developing. He needs to gain more consistency but is still a helluva player who has shown success on the international level. <br><br><br><br>The fact is the US was one goal away from beating Germany and playing in the semi finals of the last world cup and is only getting better. So all the US players cant be as bad as you make them out to be. Watch out for Freddy Adu and Eddie Johnson next world cup. They will be a force for years to come.</p>
