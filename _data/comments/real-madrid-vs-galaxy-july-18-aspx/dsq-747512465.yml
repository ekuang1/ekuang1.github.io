message: "<p>i really do not think Real is going to play with their starting line-up.  My prediction is the following:  Beckham (b/c he needs to promote his soccer camp), Raul (nothing else to do), Owen (he needs the US exposure),  Zidane (he's getting old and looking more undisirable), and Solari.  <br><br><br><br>I doubt Ronaldo is going to play b/c of his desire of over-extended holidays and Roberto Carlos ALWAYS flakes on these types of games.  In fact, it's interesting to note that Ronaldo and R. Carlos didn't play in the match against UNAM Pumas in Madrid.  It's very unlikely for the pair to play against the Galaxy.  Also, forget about Figo...with the talks going on of him being traded to Liverpool, last thing he needs is an injury from playing a silly game. <br><br><br><br>All in all, I will be going to the game, and it would be nice to see at least Beckham, Owen and Raul play.  I will be extremely happy if R. Carlos plays, but I'm not holding my breath!  <br><br><br><br></p>"
