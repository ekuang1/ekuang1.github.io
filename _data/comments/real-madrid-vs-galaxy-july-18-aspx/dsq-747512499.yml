message: <p>We just attended the training session...what a total disappointment!  The team was about 40 minutes late to take the field, and then they only practiced for about 40 minutes!  The big 5 never did anything at all except run a few laps, and then sit on the grass.  We paid $30/ea to get in and I am telling you it wasn't worth $5.  My daughter and I were in the VERY front, right by the grass and the players never even came close at all.  <br><br><br><br>I can pretty much assure everyone that there will be no autograph session tomorrow after the game. . .the crazies ruin it for everyone.  It is sad that because of a few jerks that feel the need to run out onto the field, the players don't feel safe enough to sign an autograph for a little girl that has tears in here eyes!!<br><br><br><br>Not much else to say...I hope the game is worth watching, and I sincerely hope the big dogs come off the porch tomorrow.</p>
