message: <p>I, also will be at the 7/18 game. Man, tickets were pretty expensive. But anyway, I can't wait til I see the Galacticos beat down on the Galaxy!<br><br><br><br>But who knows, I mean there might be an unexpected fall from Real Madrid and  the Galaxy might  pull up with a tie or even a win.<br><br>I'm only 12 and I've been a Real and Zidane fan for life. This is the first time I've got to come to one of his games. When I used to live in Paris, I never got tickets for him. I am very very excited for the match and I hope to see a good match and a good Zinedine Zidane.<br><br></p>
