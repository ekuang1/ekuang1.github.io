message: "<p>Nice!!<br><br><br><br>I saw the Galaxy vs. Quakes game up here in San Jose.<br><br><br><br>I still think Landon Donovan is hot....<br><br><br><br>About MLS: I think that MLS is doing a great job, filling the same role as minor league baseball does in that sport.  Giving players a career path to play as professionals, keeping alive interest in the game, and getting players trained up for where it counts: the international games and the World Cup!<br><br><br><br>I'm very glad the US is becoming a contender in recent World Cup years.  And the fan base is starting to come out.  In 2002, I watched a game at something like 4 in the morning, at Britannia Arms in San Jose, and the place was so packed I couldn't get in the door!  That's amazing.  We'll win it all someday....<br><br></p>"
