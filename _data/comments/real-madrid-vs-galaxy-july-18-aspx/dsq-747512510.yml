message: <p>I just had my picture taken with Roberto Carlos... I drove over to Hollywood Bl., parked, and looked around at Mann's Chinese Theater but they weren't there. I walked down a little further to the shopping center on Hollywood and Highland and there were 2 ordinary tourist buses with the team. Suddenly Roberto was directly to my right, 5 feet away. After he took a photo with some other people I got one with his and told him I was a big fan. I was wearing my jersey and should've had him sign that too... oh well. It was cool. There were some younger guys too, some "canteranos" that I didn't recognize. Some people stayed on the buses, I didn't see any other big names. HALA MADRID!!!</p>
