message: <p>Real Madrid is going to bring a full squad and should win handily.  Landon Donovan has played well this year for the U.S.; however, I think he plays far below his capacity when playing with the Galaxy, he just doesn't look like the same player.  Tonight's game, has a ENORMOUS impact on what soccer (football) will mean for the US for the years to come.  There are rumors circulating that Beckham may be bought out by the Galaxy, if they can put forth enough cash to bring him over.  His bitch of a wife apparently wants to live in the U.S., and it sounds like he will do whatever the hell she wants to do.  Beckham is a pussy and he wears women's underwear according to Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice).  If an MLS team could score Beckham, that would open the flood gates to all the closeted soccer fans in America.  Soccer would soon gather a much stronger following, meaning more money, and with more money we will have better players and a more competitive league.  I hope the Galaxy win tonight, for the future of US soccer.</p>
