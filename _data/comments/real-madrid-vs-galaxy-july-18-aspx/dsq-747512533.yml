If the US had to play again south america to qualify they would never make it to the world cup.<br><br><br><br>But they keep playing against countries whose #1 sport is not soccer and whose population is less than that of Rhode Island.<br><br><br><br>That is why they are ranked high. <br><br><br><br>How come at every world cup they LOSE miserably?<br><br><br><br>In france 1998 they didnt even win a single match!<br><br><br><br>USA, MExico, Canada have it so easily.  They get to go to the World Cup by beating Panama, Costa Rica, etc.... What a joke!<br><br><br><br>Try playing Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, etc.. in order to qualify</p>'
