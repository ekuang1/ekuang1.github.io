message: <p>People People People--It is Soccer here in America so if you like calling it "Football", which it actually is in other countries, go there then, this is America, we speak English, we call it SOCCER, and we don't undermine our talent here IN America.  Landon is a good player (Fact), and if all you, or anyone, can do is be negative and critisize him for all his  let me give you a quote by Teddy Roosevelt:<br><br><br><br>"It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat."<br><br><br><br>So I say good job Landon Donovon and to you other "brave and valiant souls", keep fighting the good fight, and props to you for taking the high road and sticking to your own country's sometimes struggling league--in comparison to more established and more prestigious teams--that needs to be built, to be developed, and to be endured by the test of time so that in America we can become as strong in SOCCER as we are in the many other facets of our great nation.  So do not be overly critical of people who take the high road, or even those who choose to follow the rut that others have established but remember that American Soccer will be great someday and remember, "Rome was not bult in a day"</p>
