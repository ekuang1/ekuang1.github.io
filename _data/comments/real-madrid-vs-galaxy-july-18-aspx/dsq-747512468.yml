message: <p>I've watched mls highlights for the past two years and the best players i've seen don't even play for the L. A. Galaxy. I mean Landon's good, but only because he's playing with rookies and soccer players that are crap in his league. Koby is okay, but he's mostly good at like set plays and can't do much himself. Hartman is a great goalie and i think he'll make a couple good saves, but i think he's too used to these feeble shots mls has to offer and when he takes on a shot from like beckham or owen, he's screwed. The best mls has too offer is goalie's. Even with the mls all star team, i think they still will get pummeled <br><br>I wish the Galaxy luck, but even if they had all the luck in the world they will still lose.<br><br></p>
