message: <p>RM showed they are a top class team.  One of the announcers hit the nail on the head last night when he said that one player from RM, is probably worth the (in terms of salary) entire LA Galaxy's salary with the exception of Landon Donovan.  It was no surprise that RM won, it was also no surprise that the reason Figo has his own chant is because he may have the best ball handling skills in the entire world.  He is truly magical, and hope to see him play sometime soon.<br><br><br><br>Peace,<br><br>           Joe</p>
