message: <p>The game was amazing and I have to agree with dementiano <br><br>, Zindane showed how the ball should be handled. RM played like the true stars they are. If they wanted to they could have made Galaxy look really, really bad by wining game 10 to zip. They left it at 2-0 not to make the players from Galazy look like loosers in their own home town. That's class. As for Beckham, he was dreamy as usual but so was Carlos. Figo was well received because like Zindane, he handles the ball better than anyone. Watching them was a pure pleasure. It wouldn't even matter if they had lost because they were out there to show their skills and the classiness of how beautifully the sport of soccer can be played. <br><br><br><br>It was a great honor and pleasure to watch them play!!<br><br><br><br>REAL MADRID KICKS ASS!!</p>
