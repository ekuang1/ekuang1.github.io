message: <p>I could only chant to LA that they will never walk alone.  Hats off to the Riot Club for their LA support despite all odds in the Real game.  I go to all the LA matches and my major critisim is the first time touch by LA in the Real game.  To loose the ball so many times in midfield is unacceptable.  You loose it there, you loose five player and momentum.  It was clearly evident in watching the match again on FSC that LA does not have a chess match mentality to know five steps ahead on what they may potentially attempt to do with the ball.  The skill is OK and the speed to do things quickly is potentially there... but lets no abandon the metal side of this game.  It's a thinking game and when you are presented with constant change and choice... you must have the mental capacity to "know" what is ahead and to contunually compensate for it.  Doing things differently, creatively.  Those of you who have played the game for many years know what I'm talking about.  <br><br><br><br>ZIZU is a master and we saw that clearly on display.  Always thinking... always translating that thinking into movement on and off the ball.    We need men who can think out there, not boys.  <br><br><br><br>One last thing... we need LA to forget looking abroad for talent... stop traveling to South America to find someone.  Start traveling right here.  We have it in our own backyard.  Players who can think... as well as having the skill.  (We had one foreign midfielder against Real whose brain turned off and was evident to all.)<br><br><br><br>As a fan... I will get behind them... so will the Riot club... and so will other supporters.</p>
