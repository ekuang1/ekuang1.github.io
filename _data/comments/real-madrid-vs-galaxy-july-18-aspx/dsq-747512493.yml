message: <p>Dur Dur Dur<br><br>What are you people babbling about of course the Galaxy is going to loose. There is not ass much money in the MLS like in the Spanish leagues over there. Money can buy the best players, but it cant buy heart and I think thats the only way Galaxy is going to win, at least I hope they do.</p>
