message: <p>That's too bad... well, I'll be going to the game tonight, paid 65 bucks for a crappy seat but I'm a huge RM fan and the chance to see them in L.A. won't ever come by again, so what the hell. Apparently they're going to be touring the Hollywood walk of fame in about 1 hour... I'd love to get off work for an early lunch break and see them. Anyway, these friendlies are usually pretty garbage games, but I think we'll see most of the big names just to please the crowd. Ronaldo is doubtful after a slight injury in the Chicago game.</p>
