message: "<p>Landon Donovan is not ready for the world stage, nor will he ever be, because he suffers from extreme homesickness outside of the U.S.  While watching him play last season in the Bundesliga, I was disturbed to see how below average he looked against the rest of the German first division.  In some ways I thik he set the American soccer cause back another generation, because the German commentators kept making an example of him by saving, \"look, here's the best America has to offer!\"  Perhaps he'll play better in Carson.<br><br><br><br>Regarding Real Madrid, they are the Los Angeles Dodgers/Lakers of soccer: despite having all that talent and spending all that money, they disappoint because they don't play together as a team.  Kobe and Shaq aren't the only two athletes that can't perform when they try to steal the show from the other one.  However, Spanish First Division stars should beat a team that, if lucky, can be compared to any European mediocre second division team.  \"Hey, paella man!  Hook Phil up!\"</p>"
