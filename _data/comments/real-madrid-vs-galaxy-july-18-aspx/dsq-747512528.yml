message: "<p>Real Madrid players have just started their pre-season. They aren't even at a 50 %. Galaxy players are already involved in the regular season. Conclusion: this same play two months later would have been much more positive for Real and MLS is still quite far from European leagues.<br><br>Sorry for my bad English! Thanks for your passion and fair play, Angelinos and Galaxy soccer supporters!!</p>"
