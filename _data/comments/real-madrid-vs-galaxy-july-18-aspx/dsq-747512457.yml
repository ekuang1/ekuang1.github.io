message: <p>I was at euro cup last year and saw all of europes top talent with their respective national teams, the USA will never compare as donovan sucks and cant play with real players and freddy adu will never mature to the player we all hope he will be as he doesnt even start for his freaking MLS club. what a pity....the fan base here is growing and that is good, but our game just doesnt compare to europe or south america....too bad for all us futbol fans here in the states-we have to go to europe to watch quality games</p>
