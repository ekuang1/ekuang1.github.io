message: <p>Representing not quite the lowest denominator in web developers but someone new to some jargon you use in the installation of this app for securing contact forms - how exactly does this install? <br><em>"You can choose to either reference the assembly in order to get started right away, or choose to add the source code file and the javascript file (make sure to mark it as an embedded resource) to your own project."</em><br>I know you've apparently worked hard to make this an easy app to employ but I am asking for one more step in your explanation that may help others in the shallower end of the programmers pond. What exactly is the elegant, fast way to accomplish this installation? The phrase "reference the assembly" sounds so simple, this is probably a very stupid question...<br>Your logic in the design and execution sounds very, very good. <br>/mark<br><br></p>
