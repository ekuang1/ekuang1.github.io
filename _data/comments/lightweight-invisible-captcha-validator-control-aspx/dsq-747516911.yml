message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I enyoyed reading your blog post about the "Lightweight Invisible CAPTCHA Validator Control"<br>I have a question regarding this post and your comment<br><a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2006/09/26/Lightweight_Invisible_CAPTCHA_Validator_Control.aspx#4597" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://haacked.com/archive/2006/09/26/Lightweight_Invisible_CAPTCHA_Validator_Control.aspx#4597">https://haacked.com/archive/...</a><br>I fail to see why the second MIMEed hidden field is necessery. <br>The first and the 3th hashed value can be compared on the server. Isn't that enough?<br>Maybe your original idea was to do a compare on the clientside but I don't see this implemented if I read the code (I can't execute the code atm sry)<br>I think the second hidden field is redundant in the current code that you provide for download.<br>My second question is about why you replaced the hash with a symmetric encryption algorithm.<br>I fail to see the added security. Please enlighten me cause I am not too comfartable with encryption technology.<br>I would be very grateful if you could answer these 2 questions cause I am greatly interested  in the subject and would like to understand the solutions fully before using them.<br>Kind Regards, Tom Pester<br>FYI The contact page has a problem with the mail server after you submit the form<br></p>
