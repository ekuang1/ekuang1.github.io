message: <p>Thank You, every cool. The value added to an already great product just makes it that much more fantastic. I was affraid there would be no support for MVC, keep it up.<br>A few points that need to be made clear for this to work. In the flurry of anxiety to get this to the web I think a "None Informed Use Case" was not done. I don't think a dry run of implmenting this was done. If one just takes what is give it does not work. No instructions on how to set it up. It was just assumed that we all know about [test] and that means NUnit (instead [TestMethod]) and we all know that GlobalApplication is the class name for Global.asx.cs which in some cases it is not. It may just be Global. Or as one persone points out using "Global" is bad and changed it to something completely different.<br>Here are the preperation steps I think are missing.<br>1. Make sure in the TestProject you make has a reference to your MVC Web Project (Company.Foo.WebApplication).<br>2. Also make a reference to System.Web<br>3. I could not use GlobalApplication.RegisterRoutes(routes); I had to do the following:<br>Company.Foo.WebApplication.Global webApp = new Company.Foo.WebApplication.Global()<br>webApp.RegisterRoutes(routes); <br><br>Again Thank You.<br></p>
