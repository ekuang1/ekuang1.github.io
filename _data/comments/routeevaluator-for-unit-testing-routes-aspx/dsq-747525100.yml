message: <p>Has anyone managed to get the code to work correctly?<br>Besides the fact that it doesn't compile (Calls to GetMatchingRoutes should be changed to GetMatches, or vice-versa), it always returns as many routes as I have registered in my RouteCollection, and they're always excatly the same routes!  It looks like the foreach in GetMatches is redundant, but then I can't see how it can find multiple routes that match the same rule?<br>Also, is there any way to find out whether the Controller returned for a route exists?</p>
