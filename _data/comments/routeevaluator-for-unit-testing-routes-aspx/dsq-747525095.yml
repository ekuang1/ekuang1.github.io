message: <p>What the heck was that "GlobalApplication"?! Design-disaster and naming disaster.<br>I've read somewhere "no global objects in OO". And the name GlobalApplication doesn't really describe anything. What is a NonGlobalApplication? Or LocalApplication.<br>Crazy stuff. Otherwise it's all good.</p>
