message: <p>Man, I am just fed up with solar radiation. <br>I mean, I get it. It's hard up in the sun. You've got the pressures of constricting magnetic field lines due to differential rotation rates of a superheated plasma; you've got a your nuclear flux, not to mention the crushing force of gravity that's just itching to go white dwarf like it was Danny DeVito in a toaster oven.<br>But twisted flux lines or no, you subatomic particles are not welcome here. Especially you charged ones! Now, some might miss the Northern Lights, but I say it's time for us to draw a line in the interplanetary sand and stand up to the sun. This injustice must not stand! Send your stream of particles to other planets if they don't have the guts to say no, but we're putting you on notice!<br>And don't try to slip a neutrino past us! We're on to you!</p>
