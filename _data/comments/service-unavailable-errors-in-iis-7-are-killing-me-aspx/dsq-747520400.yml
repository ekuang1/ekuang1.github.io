message: <p>I have a similar problem but not exactly the same.    We have a new server (windows 2008 r2) that we are using as a TFS server.    We also cant get the TFS site to come up when the app pool runs with the TFSSERVICE identity (this is a active directory service account that is a local admin on the box).   <br>I set up a test site and test app pool with a simple .html file.   When the app pool for this site is set to run as Network Service or ApplicationPoolIdentity the site works and the html file renders.   <br>If I use my active directory account (local admin) or and other a/d account like TFSSERVICE,  I get the HTTP Error 503. The service is unavailable and the app pool is shut down.   The following error is in the event log.<br>The identity of application pool test is invalid. The user name or password that is specified for the identity may be incorrect, or the user may not have batch logon rights. If the identity is not corrected, the application pool will be disabled when the application pool receives its first request.  If batch logon rights are causing the problem, the identity in the IIS configuration store must be changed after rights have been granted before Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) can retry the logon. If the identity remains invalid after the first request for the application pool is processed, the application pool will be disabled. The data field contains the error number.<br>I am guess the error number in the data field is  80070569 ?<br>Any ideas?</p>
