message: <p>Hmm... the .clean.install files must not be created in all scenarios... However, I have both of them in two different Vista scenarios. Is this a new install, or an upgrade from XP?<br>In any event, the idea is to get back to default settings. The .config file may linger even after an uninstall of IIS. It would be worth trying the uninstall and reinstall again, making sure that you clean out any residual settings, such as applicationHost.config, before reinstalling.</p>
