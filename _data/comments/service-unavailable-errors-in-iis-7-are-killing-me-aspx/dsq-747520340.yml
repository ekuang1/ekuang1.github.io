message: <p>@Mike <br>1. I don't see w3wp.exe in my task manager. That's interesting.<br>2. There's nothing in my application log related to this.<br>3. I haven't tried downloading the windows debug symbol. I did share my desktop via GoToMeeting with a member of the IIS7 team who was as stymied as I was. We'll open a trouble ticket. <br>If I have time tomorrow, I can run through all the steps in your post. I just wasn't sure if it was applicable given that there were no event log messages and the appPools are all started and never die. <br>When I run <code>appcmd list apppools</code> I always get the same result, showing them started.</p>
