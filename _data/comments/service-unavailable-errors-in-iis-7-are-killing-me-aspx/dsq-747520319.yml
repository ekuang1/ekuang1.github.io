message: <p>This sounds like an App Pool issue to me.  I have see it before when the <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> user didn't have a profile.  Running the bat file on this page has fixed it for me in the past:<br><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827641" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827641">http://support.microsoft.co...</a><br>It says its only for <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> 1.0 but I know it has fixed 1.1 problems for me before and maybe even 2.0 issues.<br>You could also try aspnet_regiis -ua to uninstall <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> just to see if that is the problem.<br>The "Service Unavailable" is a page generated by IIS so i don't think any network level tools are going to help much.<br>Is UAC enabled?  Maybe try turning it off.  You could also try enabling security auditing to see if some security issue is causing the problem.<br>I think IIS is supposed to log something to event viewer when a worker process crashes, so make sure your event log isn't full and if it is clear it out or make it bigger.</p>
