message: <p>Hi Guys um I'm sure you would have already taken a look at this but I didn't see it mentioned, do you get any error messages or log entries when restarting the world wide web publishing service and just check that its logging on with the right credentials?<br>Also bare in mind that some software can actually bind port 80 as well (ie anything that might let you tunnel such as putty or ems, certain trend products, and vmware.) <br>You may also be blocked in vista if the network you are connected to is not a trusted network (network and sharing center-&gt; customise next to every network it shows, yes EVERY network even ones that are not connected to anything such as VMware virtual adapters.) I like to set it to work zone as this seems to be the most logical but vista will block ports if even one of the networks it displays is set to unknown or public. I had a virtual server running vista and I had to setup a kvm as it would knock me off rdp everytime a virtual machine would be rebooted or it detected any change on the adapter. &gt;.&lt;<br>Network Discovery may also need to be on.<br>All the best<br>Kamil</p>
