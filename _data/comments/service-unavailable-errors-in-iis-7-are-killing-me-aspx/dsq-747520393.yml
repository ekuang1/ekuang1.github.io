message: <p>Hello,<br>The same error has been killing me for a couple of days. But after going through a lot of blogs I came up with a solution and wanted to share it with you guys.<br>It started off with the error that service unavailable. To resolve that, I replicated the classic <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> application pool and changed the Application pool of my web application to the new application pool. That got rid of service unavailable error.<br>Then came "HTTP Error 401.2 - Unauthorized<br>You are not authorized to view this page due to invalid authentication headers." <br>For this I Enabled the anonymous authentication in IIS Manager. For details you can visit <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942043/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942043/">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942043/</a>.<br>Then another error which was "HTTP Error 403.14 - Forbidden<br>The Web server is configured to not list the contents of this directory."<br>To solve this, I enabled the directory browsing for my web application IIS Manager.<br>Finally, the last error was "The current identity (NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE) does not have write access to 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\Temporary ASP.NET Files'. "<br>This was resolved by giving full rights to the user NETWORK SERVICE for the folder C:\Windows\Temp.<br>So at last I'm able to test my application.<br>Best Regards.<br></p>
