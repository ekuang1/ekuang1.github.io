Are you seeing any events indicating why your worker processes are going away?  I have never seen a case where an event is not logged.<br>3) Have you followed the steps in <a href="http://mvolo.com/blogs/serverside/archive/2007/05/19/Troubleshooting-IIS7-503-_2200_Service-unavailable_2200_-errors-with-startup-debugging.aspx?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mvolo.com/blogs/serverside/archive/2007/05/19/Troubleshooting-IIS7-503-_2200_Service-unavailable_2200_-errors-with-startup-debugging.aspx?">http://mvolo.com/blogs/serv...</a><br>Thanks,<br>Mike</p>
