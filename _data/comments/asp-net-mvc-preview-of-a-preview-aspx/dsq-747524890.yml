message: <p>This whole shift in how Microsoft is working is very exciting.  The ASP.NET MVC framework looks very promising and you guys have been doing a great job of incorporating a lot of feedback into the product.<br>That said, the shot at (what I'd assume to be Castle) being in perpetual beta does make it harder for some companies to use it who refuse to use non-RTM software, but in my experience said framework has been more stable than a lot of Microsoft v1's. ;)<br>Keep up the great job, looking forward to things becoming more stable as you make your way to beta and RTM!</p>
