message: <p>One factor that I think my have not be completely represented here, is the idea of hype or growth.  Even a mature language can undergo growth spurts.  For example, if there was a mass case of deadly e.coli at the latest C++ conference, there may be a huge number of developers brushing up on or learning C++ so that they can fill the newly created void.  <br>Ruby is newish, but it is also very hyped right now.  If Java were to come out with the next "killer" technology, I am sure you would see the newbie search terms begin to bubble up to the top of the list.</p>
