message: <p>i believe those top 20 lists are totally inaccurate. it seemed very strange to me that for example md5 was much more commonly searched for than e.g. string. so i did a quick google trends query:<br><a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=java+md5%2C+java+string&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.google.com/trends?q=java+md5%2C+java+string&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">www.google.com/trends</a><br>the keywords java and string are searched for over 32 times as much  as the keywords java and md5. this seems intuitively correct.<br>i don't know how you got those lists exactly but they seem way off.</p>
