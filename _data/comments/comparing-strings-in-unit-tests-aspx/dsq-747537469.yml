message: <p>Often string differences like this occur a long way into a string (e.g. 250 chars into a 300 char string), so many string diff displays (e.g. NUnit's) only show the bit that actually differs (with a bit of context) rather than the whole string.<br>I usually find that I just need to know the character code of the first differing character (usually CR instead of LF or vice versa!) to find the problem.<br></p>
