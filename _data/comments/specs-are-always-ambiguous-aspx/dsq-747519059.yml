message: "<p>I like you point about asking questions before you write code, while your writing code, and after you write the code.<br>The fact is, your always going to have to make some assumptions about how the software should work without being told.  Sometimes these assumptions will be incorrect, but that's why you come back after the code is written and review the final functionality.<br>I know some amazing software developers that are a million times better at writing code then I'll probably ever be, but their ability to understand the underlying problem and solve it without having a clearly defined spec is not that great.<br>I think one of the best traits of a great software developer is the ability to understand the problem space and deliver a solution without the need to have every line of code defined in a spec.  As Atwood put it a while ago: <br>\"In software, we rarely have meaningful requirements. Even if we do, the only measure of success that matters is whether our solution solves the customer's shifting idea of what their problem is.\"</p>"
