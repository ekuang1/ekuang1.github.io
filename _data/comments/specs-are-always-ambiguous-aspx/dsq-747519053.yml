message: <p>I like Reg's article on this whole thing. I'm not sure how many read it (and the point he was trying to make) or just read Jeff's rant on it. But Reg's point is NOT if the solution is offered, it's HOW the solution is offered. Check out his ideas on the solutions (he's specifically talking about one he created):<br></p><blockquote><br>...this is a toy problem. Unless you load the question down with requirements that their answer resemble production code, why should you have any expectation that the candidate only knows one way to write software?<br>...The no-hopers won’t get it no matter how simple the question, and the good people won’t waste a lot of time with JavaDoc and xUnit.<br></blockquote><p><br>Sort of hard-core but it reflects the need to ask, and ask again, what's expected. And then repeat it back :). <br>I think your post is right on here Phil; unfortunately that doesn't matter when you're face down on the bar wondering why you can't pass interview tests :). Probably the worst thing is another dev creating the question:<br></p><blockquote><br>I think I'll make them do this with real numbers, not integers...<br></blockquote>
