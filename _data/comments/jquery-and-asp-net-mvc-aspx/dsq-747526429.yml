message: <p>It's great that you guys decided to incorporate jQuery into visual studio, and with that into <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> MVC. I've been using jQuery a lot lately, and I'm really happy with the clean code it produces.<br>With Microsoft embracing jQuery I can see it becoming the de-facto standard for client side web scripting!<br>That being said, does this mean Microsoft will contribute to the jQuery project as well (financially or in code)?</p>
