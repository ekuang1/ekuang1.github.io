message: <p>One for the conspiracy theorists... Why JQuery? - or why not integrate YUI as well?  One good reason might be that MS would like to have Yahoo! in their pocket - at least one day... and if JQuery becomes the defacto standard (which it's already becoming anyway TBH) then it's one more step towards the goal. :-) Who knows... seems like a reasonable competitive move to me.<br>Just playing devil's advocate on a tea break :D</p>
