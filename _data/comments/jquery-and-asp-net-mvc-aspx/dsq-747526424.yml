message: <p>I am very glad that I chose to start learning jQuery. It fits very well with ASP.NET MVC.<br>I have found that using jQuery has actually made my MVC Views much more simple since I can leverage jQuery's features to do common tasks such as alternate row styles, tooltips, animation, etc...<br>I am pleased that Microsoft has adopted the approach of using open source code. This is a great step in the right direction!</p>
