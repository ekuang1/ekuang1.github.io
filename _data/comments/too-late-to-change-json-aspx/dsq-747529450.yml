message: <p>Sounds very well reasoned.

Sort of the penny in the fusebox, run-as-admin, reaction. However they may have a comparatively acceptable number of array responses to correct.<br>Just throwing that out there. I do agree there's no reason to use GET over POST in new projects, and it would be entirely reasonable to have new web configs dialed up to a strict json policy.<br></p>
