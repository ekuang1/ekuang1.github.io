message: <p>@Andrey the flexibility of JavaScript is one of the features that has earned it many fans. I think constraining the language could be problematic.<br>Also, you're relying on waiting for new browser versions to stop supporting this feature. Old browsers continue to remain vulnerable.<br>One nice benefit of the approach I outlined is that as soon as you update your JSON service to the new format, old browsers are no longer vulnerable.</p>
