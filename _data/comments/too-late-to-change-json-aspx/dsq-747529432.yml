message: "<p>@John the fact that it doesn't match JavaScript is not a problem. It's still very close. After all, you should NEVER EVER <code>eval</code> JSON. That would open you up to all kinds of hurt. That's why you'll see that the major JSON libraries all have some sort of ParseJson method to actually parse the format.<br>@Scott Koon thanks for the links man! I figured I wasn't the first to come to this conclusion, but I didn't find those posts.<br>@Scott #2 An array is technically a JSON object though according to the spec. Returning a JSON array seems to be a common enough operation that to suddenly say you can't return JSON arrays seems pretty harsh. My proposed solution is to simply wrap the array in a standard way that everyone agrees upon.<br>ASP.NET ASMX Web Services and WCF Web Services already do this by wrapping objects in an object with a property named \"d\". Thus your array response would look like:<br><code>{'d':[{obj1:val1, obj2:val2}]}</code><br>That solves the problem too, but it's not a standard. I'd like to see some sort of standard codified into the JSON spec.</p>"
