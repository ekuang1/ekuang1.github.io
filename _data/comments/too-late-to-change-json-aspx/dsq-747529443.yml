message: <p>JSON is perfect the way it is.  It is about simplicity and only objects and arrays.  It works on any platform and needs no new features added.  Any developer that uses JSON can decide for him/herself how to validate it, check for security etc.  <br>The beautiful thing about JSON is it is not XML bloat.  XML was a decent idea as well until everyone wanted more and more bloat added.  JSON is perfect in it's most base/simple format and that is what it is.  No change needed. JSON is a platform/structure you build on top of. KISS.</p>
