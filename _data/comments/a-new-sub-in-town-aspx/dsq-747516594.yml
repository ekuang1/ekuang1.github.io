message: "<p>I'm glad that there's competition out there, but wonder if another blog OSS was needed. Rhetorical question: Doesn't Subtext already support single user blogs?  Why create something \"written from the ground up\" when something already exists that is supported by developers, users, and has a community?  Why not just jump in and extend the functionality of the existing software (Subtext in this case).<br>So far Subtext has met all of my needs, I just want a multi-user blog setup.  If I do need something further, I'll contribute to the project, not rewrite an entirely new application.  Just MHO.</p>"
