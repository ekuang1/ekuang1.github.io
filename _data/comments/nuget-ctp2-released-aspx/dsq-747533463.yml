message: <p>Well, I'm still having the issue where the vsix installer executable keeps recursively spawning a new instance of itself.  I can't install the update because of this.  Not sure what's going on.<br>As far as Intellisense is concerned, isn't it limited to hitting tab to get statement completion?</p>
