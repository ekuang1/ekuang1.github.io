message: <p>Oops, I didn't copy the whole sentence of yours, so here it is complete.<br>Since I couldn't find a comments section on <a href="https://haacked.com/articles/AboutHaacked.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://haacked.com/articles/AboutHaacked.aspx">https://haacked.com/articles/AboutHaacked.aspx</a> I'll comment here.<br>On that page you state, "What is it about American culture that causes us to ask people What do you do? and mean What is your occupation? rather than What do you do for fun?." That's true and unfortunate, but you're missing the bigger picture. You shouldn't even make the two mutually exclusive...</p>
