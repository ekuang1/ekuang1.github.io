message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Great post, great presentations, so thank you! Never mind about leaving the cleats at home. :)<br>We talked briefly after one of your sessions about putting elements that need model access into the master page - i.e. "Last 5 news items" kind of things that need to be on every page. You mentioned that you now have a way of doing this without using the Html.RenderAction() method in MVC Futures. Is it possible for you to give some information about this?<br>Again, thanks! :)<br></p>
