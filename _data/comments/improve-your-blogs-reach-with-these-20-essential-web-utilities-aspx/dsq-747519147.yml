message: "<p>Personally, I think the use of random images to \"spice\" up a post is distracting and lame. Hey, we're talking about Ruby? THEN GET ME A PICTURE OF AN ACTUAL RUBY, STAT!!! Hashes are the fingerprints of code? SUMMON ME A JPEG OF A FINGERPRINT, OH GREAT CREATIVE COMMONS!!<br>Even worse are the blogs that use totally random pictures-- sometimes from the author's personal photo collection-- interspersed with the text. I won't name any names, but they know who they are. <br>You should only use images to communicate something visual that the text cannot. They're not page breaks. This isn't Maxim. Apply the same Strunk &amp; White rule to images that you would to text: if you can delete the image without altering the meaning of the article, then it shouldn't be there in the first place.<br>Sorry. Pet peeve of mine.</p>"
