message: <p>Brilliant list Phil!<br>I've been using Stock.xchng for a while now, but sometimes it just doesn't have what I'm looking for - so it sounds like PicFindr is the way to go.<br>Another tip that I think is important to mention (while not exactly a web-util) is that <strong>it needs to be easy for readers to submit your blog entries to various community/bookmarking sites</strong>. <br>I realize this can be blog-software dependent, but as you know Subtext has a built-in skin control (the <strong>ShareThisPost</strong> control) that will add links for submitting to <a href="http://del.icio.us" rel="nofollow noopener" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, Digg, and DotNetKicks... and other sites could easily be added by just changing the control template. (You can see my blog for an example)<br>Anyhow, great write up as usual... and I'm really digging the tweaks you made to your skin!</p>
