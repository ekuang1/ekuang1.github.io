message: <p>i am hijacking this site while the haack man is gone.  but alas, since i can't code, i will only be able to hijack the comment section. <br><br><br><br>i shall begin with my review of a fantastic dinner Laura and i enjoyed last night.  after looking through the kcrw fringe benefits list, we ended up at "michelia" on west 3rd street, right by the beverly center.  it was listed as a vietnamese bistro, so i was expecting a quaint little place, but it turned out to be quite shi-shi, with full table settings and a waterfall on the back wall. the prices were not too bad - about $20 a dish. but with the 20% kcrw discount, it seemed like a good deal. my only complaint is that our waiter was a bit of a nincompoop. <br><br><br><br>"i'm allergic to eggs. does the sauce have egg or mayonaise in it?"<br><br>"no."<br><br><br><br>"how about the batter?"<br><br>"we use egg to coat the fish with panko, but i'll ask the chef to do without."<br><br><br><br>"great, thanks"<br><br><br><br>the food arrives - with very maynaisey sauce all over the place.<br><br><br><br>"are you sure the sauce has no mayonaise?"<br><br>"yes, the sauce is mayonaise based."<br><br><br><br>"but i just told you i was allergic and we had a whole conversation about the sauce and batter..."<br><br><br><br>anyway, once that got sorted out, laura and had a great time. we had tasty vietnamese noodles and sea bass wrapped in banana leaves.  <br><br><br><br>more hijacking to come later...<br><br><br><br></p>
