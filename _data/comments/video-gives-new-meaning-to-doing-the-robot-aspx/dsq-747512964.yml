message: "<p>I am so surprised that you three read the comment section on the  old entries!!  I was sure that my post would just be a little joke for Haack when he returns. And speaking of the Haack man, I heard from him last night as he was driving through Reno.  He's alive and well, and coming home a day early!!! : )<br><br>I'm glad he gave me a heads up so I have time to send Deuce Bigalo home. Always so thoughtful, that dear husband of mine.<br><br><br><br>Thank goodness he's on his way home. There's only so much I can do for <a href=\"http://Haacked.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"Haacked.com\">Haacked.com</a>...I'm sure his Google adsense earnings have dropped during his absense, and there's only so much technical tid-bits I can pretend to write about...<br><br><br><br>\"I just hate DOT NET NUKE. THe documentation is just horrible!\"<br><br><br><br>On that note, I shall get back to cleaning up after the big mess Mr. Bigalo left. Over and out!</p>"
