message: <p>One thing to note, you MUST have already established a session for this to work. If not, the SessionId will change on every single request and your next request will fail itself because its signed with a session id that is no longer your session id. You must 'peg down' the session by setting a value in it. for instance, Session["Anything"] = <a href="http://DateTime.now" rel="nofollow noopener" title="DateTime.now">DateTime.now</a></p>
