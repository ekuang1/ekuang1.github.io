message: <p>I'm surprised she didn't come spayed...most rescue operations take care of that for you as they have more experience caring for the animals after the operation.  Regardless, I'm sure she'll do fine, she seems like a strong dog.  You also might want to look into getting her a "Martingale" type collar (just google "italian greyhound martingale" for more info, I buy mine off eBay)...martingales are specially designed for sighthounds as they are more comfortable when they are on leash (as you mentioned, they are nothing but skin and bones), plus they look great.  I have 2 collars for my guy...a regular one for tags, and a martingale just for walking.  Her neck will thank you for this!<br><br><br><br>She looks great and seems to be adapting well.  As far as the name thing goes, sighthounds (especially females) can be a bit aloof and stubborn at times, so don't worry about it too much...she'll get it :-)<br><br><br><br>I never thought about putting my guy to work...good idea!  He needs to start pulling his weight around here.  You inspired me to post some pics of him on my site..check 'em out.<br><br><br><br>Keep us posted on the operation!</p>
