  @Ken Some of them might need tweaking because of the difference in how PowerShell handles quoting, but most of them should work. I think the ones that use "sed" won't work because that's not included with Git.



  @Jamie Nothing specific other than put them in a repository and write some scripts to pull them to the right place.



  @Jason that's exactly right. It's what I recommend doing. I could probably make it work for SSH too, but I got lazy. :P
