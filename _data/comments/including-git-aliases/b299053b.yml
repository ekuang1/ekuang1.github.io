  I use the following trick to generate shell aliases for all defined git aliases, such that every one works without `git` before it. It sounds like a small bonus, but I use these commands tens to hundreds of times a day, and find the added fluency really helpful.



  fish:



  git config --list | perl -lne '/^alias[.]([^=]+)/ and print "alias $1=\"git\\ $1\""' | source



  bash:



  eval "$(git config --list | perl -lne '/^alias[.]([^=]+)/ and print "alias $1=git\\ $1"')"



  This is probably a bad idea if git aliases have names that overlap with actual commands (like find, history, cp), but can be helpful if you don't.
