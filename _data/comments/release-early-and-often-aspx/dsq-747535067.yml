message: <p>Excellent post Phil. I wish some of the teams inside of Microsoft would have learned your lesson. I think MVC is a perfect example of just right release cycles for software. Perfect examples would be<br>WP7 - Everyone was so excited for WP7 yet the they are not doing a good job at all about releasing which is starting to make some mad. They is a lot of catch up to do and the releases are way to slow. WP7 needs to be constantly reved.<br>IE - Have to wait way to long for releases of IE. Like you said above about chrome, ie would be a perfect example of something that it would be great to release more often as soon as features change. Maybe you wait to release "breaking" changes to the next Major release but you add feature releases move often. You don't want to release a breaking change to IE that breaks every site out there but it would be nice to get stuff like new CSS3 tags as they evolve.<br>I think the Entity Framework is another perfect example of "Just right" release schedule.</p>
