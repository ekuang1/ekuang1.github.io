message: "<p>Great post...and you're dead-on about the benefits of rapid feedback loops. If you're really interested in this sort of thing, I highly recommend Chet Richards' \"Certain To Win\" which outlines the way OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) loops, which were developed by Colonel John Boyd with military operations in mind, can be applied to business. In one example, he describes how Honda used rapid feedback loops to basically demolish Yamaha in the field of motorcycle manufacturing in the early 80's. It's an excellent read!<br>ps: Also, I liked the \"cargo cult\" analogy. I've used that term before to describe how some companies blindly follow the processes of more successful companies while ignoring the effects of corporate culture...and I'm amazed at how many people have responded with \"Huh? What's a cargo cult?\"</p>"
