message: <p>Good post. I agree with your arguments and I'd like to add another issue, blocking frequent releases.<br>I work on a Line Of Business application. In applications like that, often features are dependant on one another, so if Feature A is ready, but dependant on Feature B, C and D, and one of those features is not ready, you can't release. This requires a bit more planning.<br>Also, when working on a new application, you may have extensive technical requirements to support a feature. This can seriously impact the release frequenty as well.</p>
