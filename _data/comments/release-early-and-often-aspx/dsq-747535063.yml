message: <p>Great well balanced post Phil. I am totally with you on the release early, often, but not too often. One key benefit I've found getting bits out there is that customers will identify scenarios that you completely missed. Add to that the self-regulating community of folks that weigh in on the importance of those scenarios. It helps you to be much more intentional about what you are doing. Ultimately you may decide not to support a specific scenario but you made that conscious decision as opposed to it happening accidentally.<br>Also agreed on the importance of differentiating previews from the more finalized releases for frameworks. Giving folks who want it the visibility / access to the bits whenever they want them while still mitigating from randomization of those that don't want to track a moving target is key.<br>Thanks for the post!<br>Glenn<br></p>
