message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Well based on your comment "I believe this is why you see Ruby on Rails releasing every two years and ASP.NET MVC release yearly.".  And also based on previous release dates of MVC:<br>13 March 2009 ASP.NET MVC 1.0<br>10 March 2010 ASP.NET MVC 2.0<br>13 January 2011 ASP.NET MVC 3.0<br>(info from Wikipedia)<br>So I'm assuming that MVC 4 will arrive sometime within the next 12 months...<br>Thanks<br>Anton</p>
