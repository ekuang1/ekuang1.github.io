message: "<p>PFT Test - Physical Fitness Test Test. Also called a PT Test.<br>@Scott - The pluralizing actually happens in more places that you may have previously noticed.  I think the adding the \"s\" at the end makes things easier to roll off of the tongue. Although it is technically incorrect, it is easier to say.  \"We are BFF!\" vs. \"We are BFFs!\" Someone might think I was retarded saying either, but moreso the former than the latter.<br>The military tends to do this in many places after converting to acronyms.  The military is notoriously just as bad about acronyms as IT.  At least IT doesn't change their lingo every three years [yet]!  <br>PTs - The uniform worn when doing Physical Training (PT). <br>   Legitimate usage: \"We wear PTs when we do PT.\" <br>The term PTs as Physical Trainings doesn't make any sense unless you understand it is in reference to the clothing you wear for PT.<br>BDUs - Battle Dress Uniform[s], but you are talking about a singular set. <br>   Legitimate usage: \"I am wearing BDUs.\"  <br>ACUs - Army Combat Uniform[s] - same as above.</p>"
