message: <p>I can't help but notice your improper pluralizing of the phrase BFF. If you expand it out into its component part's, you'll notice that the phrase "Best Friends Forevers" isn't grammatically correct. So, technically it should read "BFF Forever". This minor nitpick ruined the article for me and completely invalidated your post. You can go ahead and fix that now.<br>Perhaps you should coin a phrase for the act of correcting a post without having read the complete post?<br>;)</p>
