message: <p>I've always thought that "RAS Syndrome" is a daft term. The acronym isn't the redundant part; it is the word after the acronym that is redundant. A far more apt term is RPAWS Syndrome (Redundant Post Acronym Syndrome Syndrome). It doesn't roll off the tongue quite so well though.<br>I personally prefer the term "portmanteau bag" for such acronym-word combinations, but it's a much rarer term. On the web, it only seems to be used in a genuinely tautological fashion, rather than ironically.</p>
