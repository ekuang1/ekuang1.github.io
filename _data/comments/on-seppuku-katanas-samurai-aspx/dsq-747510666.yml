message: <p>"and space ninjas pwn all!"<br>lol the plural of ninja is ninja  = P<br>I ordered a paul chen katana;<br><a href="http://www.swordsofhonor.com/prka.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.swordsofhonor.com/prka.html">http://www.swordsofhonor.co...</a><br>and infact i am holding it now. I own a wakazashi (meaning youth in japanese) but it's not a "real" one.<br>Very interesting article I must say. Most katanas are roughly 38~41 inches (including handle), while wakazashis range from about 27 to 31 inches and the tantos are the smallest. In my opinion I would think that it's a tanto you are holding. Very nice  = D</p>
