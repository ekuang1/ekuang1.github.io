message: <p>Hattori Hanzo existed but he did not make swords. Infact he technicaly was not a samurai. He was a practitioner of ninpo (ninjutsu). He allined the 7 leading clans during the pre majie eara (excuse spelling). Ergo becoming the true lord of the ninja.... no a samurai.... not a sword smith... samurai where arrogan pigs who missused power. And much to the belife of the public. ninjas where not assasins... they where more like the underground resistance.. though shure i will admit there would have been the few who did do bounty hunting and so forth. Read some history books.. and try to do it with an unbiased opion and remember the history books where writen by the samurai .... the enemy of the ninja.</p>
