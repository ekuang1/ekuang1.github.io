message: <p>Harakiri and Seppuku are not the same thing. Seppuku is assisted suicide and another person cuts your head off after you decapitate yourself. Harakiri just implies suicide, you dont need to use any swords. If a Japanese man were to throw himself of a building, it would be considered harakiri, not seppuku.</p>
