message: <p>To Bryan; There is no tool per se that can sharpen a sword in the sense that you are thinking. Swords are sharpened with stones. The stones are special. They are mined in Japan, cost hundreds of dollars each, and are difficult to get. It takes many grades of stones to polish the blade down to a decent finish, then finger stones to bring out the temper line, along with different types of oils and etc to get it to a high degree of polish. Many polishers charge $100 to $300 per inch of blade, up one side and down the other, and unless you have an ancestral blade made by an excellent smith, it's not worth it to have the blade put into full polish. Fred Lohman does a basic polish job good enough for the average sword for around $800. Stones alone will run you thousands of dollars. That's why a professional job cost so much.   Magoo</p>
