message: <p>For the guy thats going to Japan looking for real swordsmiths, all I can tell you is that you better carry a good amount of cash with you ($50k or more). I doubt you can get a real one done in less than a months time, and if you plan to take it out of the country you are going to need a license. Going to Japan and getting a real japanese katana these days is a very hard process...not to mention extemely expensive....good luck!</p>
