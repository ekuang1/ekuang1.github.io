message: <p>and with whoever left the comment of the ninja... try reading... while some ninjas were assassins, many were peasents and fighting was only a small part of it, in Ninjitsu, there are 18 different levels or studdys, while Busido only has like 10 or something, either way, it was a much more disiplined way of life...<br><br>and space ninjas pwn all!</p>
