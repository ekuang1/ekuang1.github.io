message: <p>Whoa, Guys...<br>I do speak Japanese, and I will tell you that both Harakiri and Seppuku translate very literally to "Disembowelment". As was previously said, however, one is more proper.<br>I'll use an analogy:<br>Harakiri=Whore where<br>Seppuku=Prostitute<br>Sorry to be vulgar, but that's the only way I could think to put it....=P<br>Anyways, in response to a previous post, women were just as expected to kill themselves to regain their honor as men were... To the Japanese during that time period, death had practically no meaning. If they talked like we do now it would have been like "Oh, she killed herself? What a shame...", and then on with the conversation. This is what "Bushido" is all about. Personally, I think I'll skip the whole "Ready to die for my master at any time" thing....:).</p>
