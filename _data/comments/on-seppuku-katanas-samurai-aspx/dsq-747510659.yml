message: <p>The blade you are holding is a Tanto in its shira-saya. Good demo of seppuku but as you can see there is only a small portion of blade left and would not bring a quick death as a wakazashi would. The point was not to just dump ones intestines on the floor, but to sever a major artery that runs anterior to the spine behind the intestines and down the legs. For this you would need a 24" blade like a wakazashi, death is almost instant. And FYI if the Samurai was lucky enough to be beheaded the beheader would only strike the neck deep enough to cut the spinal cord, detaching the head was dishonorable.</p>
