message: <p>perpetualnoise u know what ure talking about, and only a few ninja were actually asassins, most of the ninja warriors were really similair to the samurai warriors, then therse the peasents, who wered traind to fight most of there life, although they were still ordinary townsmen, and whoever said that the samurai tested there swords on the towns men, that is true but only in some places, some of the samurai clans were brutal pigs but many were peacefull little townships, and only ever went to war once every decade or so, what does that say for modern man? the people of that time were more disciplined than todays people, and commiting suicide for the samurai thing has a pretty cool story, if you take the time to find the truth. by the way there are 18 disciplines of ninja and i have been studying ninjutsu for nine years, i can make katanas and i have a collection of roughly 5430 shuriken including my 50 inciedary shuriken i recieved from poppy at christmas and i own a real wakazashi sword</p>
