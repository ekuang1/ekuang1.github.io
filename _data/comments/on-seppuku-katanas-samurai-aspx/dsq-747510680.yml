message: <p>I'm old and always wanted a samurai sword.I read the "Book of five rings"when I was a teenager,and it got me through some difficult times.I bought a 3 piece stainless steel replica set dirt cheap,and spent days sharpening them.I know they're not the real thing,but just the shape and feel will do for an old fellow.I relate to the old guy wanting to be left out for the bears rather than the old persons home.The method of Hari-kiri is something that I may use in the future,,,how noble to be that unselfish in ones twilight years.Is it true that the sword is only drawn when it will shed blood,therefore obliging the Samurai to pursue diplomacy and any other means to prevent the blood bath that will result?Peace to you</p>
