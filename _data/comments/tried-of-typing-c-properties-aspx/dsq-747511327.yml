message: <p>In Visual Studio 2010, you can just write the following:<br>public bool AutoAccept <br>{ <br>   get;<br>   set;<br>} <br>And it will allocate a variable for you within the class and you only have to use AutoAccept within your class rather than allocating a variable and setting it and getting it with a get/set parameter.</p>
