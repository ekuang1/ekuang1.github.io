message: <p>Phil,<br><br>   I think that you're right on all accounts about the benefits of making full properties that encapsulate private fields.  And since I started using ReSharper it has been a no-brainer.  <br><br><br><br>Or has it?<br><br><br><br>I've decided that it's not such a bad thing if it's done in such a way that the field can be replaced with a property later on.  Expecially in rapid prototyping, who wants to type a bunch of code out when it's not going to bring any benefit?<br><br><br><br>Well, if you follow some normal naming convention then you can get around it.<br><br><br><br>In the normal style, I always name my properties in camel case, with the first letter capitalized.  I also name the underlying fields the same thing except w/ the first letter in lower case.  FxCop doesn't like that, but I haven't heard an arguyment that I agree with.<br><br><br><br>Anyways, if I'm feeling lazy about making properties, then I'll just make a public, capitalized, camel-case (is that what it's called?) field.<br><br><br><br>If I wind up keeping the class, all I have to do is rename the field and make a property with the same name.  Just that easy.<br><br><br><br></p>
