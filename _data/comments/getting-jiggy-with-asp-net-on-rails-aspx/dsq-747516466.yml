message: <p>I was quite impressed with the features last night but today I've been digging through the code and I'm less so.<br>A lot of the stuff is just throwing long strings together with no regard for encoding in the SQL table and column names as far as I could see as well as a similar problem dumping to Html but that might just be a debug function.<br>Another limitation seems to be that you have to effectively have your DAL right inside your web application as it's the only place build providers can actually run.<br>Apparently it is db neutral yet everywhere I see command parameters being added it is using the SqlServer "@" syntax so how well it would work with the likes of Oracle I'm not sure.<br>There's also a major concurrency issue with getting back auto-increment keys.  The comment speaks for itself;<br>//the default convention is that every table has a unique, auto-increment key<br>//this is for setting the PK after save. @@IDENTITY or IDENTITY_SCOPE can <br>//be used, but don't translate to other DBs. MAX does so it's used here<br>It also doesn't appear to handle Null's in any way shape or form.<br>The code is littered with Xml comments that are missing the parameter information too.<br>Seems like more of a 0.x release at the moment.<br>[)amien</p>
