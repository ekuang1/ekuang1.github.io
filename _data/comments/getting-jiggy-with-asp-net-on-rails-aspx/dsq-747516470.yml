message: "<p>Thought I would address a few points raised by Damien, and Hammett. <br>First Hammett:  One of the reasons I made this thing is because using Castle requires a bucket of DLLs and configuration. Even then, you have to deal with nHib and let's just say it's not my favorite thing :). My goal is not to introduce yet another platform - it's to make life a little simpler for developers.<br>Damien:<br>**A lot of the stuff is just throwing long strings together <br>&gt;&gt; True. We don't have UTF-8 support yet but hopefully soon.<br><br>***Another limitation seems to be that you have to effectively have your DAL right inside your web application <br>&gt;&gt; No, the BuildProvider is a convenience. If you notice at the end of the webcast I point out if you don't want to do this, use our CodeGenerator to put the classes to file.<br>**There's also a major concurrency issue with getting back auto-increment keys<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The concurrency issues with running a MAX are the same as @@IDENTITY - they grab the last ID inserted. The MAX query happens nanoseconds after insert, and it happens in a batch with the insert call (not a separate connection) so the two queries execute back to back.<br>**It also doesn't appear to handle Null's in any way shape or form.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course it does. Set a column to null.<br>**The code is littered with Xml comments that are missing the parameter information too.<br>&gt;&gt; Yes I need to clean things up a bit :):). Could use some help if you're game....<br></p>"
