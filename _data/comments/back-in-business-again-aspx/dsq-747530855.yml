message: <p>Amazing. No proper backups and no RAID array for important stuff. Sounds like a hardwarehorror story to me :-).<br>Seriously, simple RAID 1 SATA controllers are integrated on motherboards and all it costs you to buy two (instead of one) disks. Which are really inexpensive these days.<br>Hope you recover the important data...at least source code for those advanced <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc 2 features we need ;-D</p>
