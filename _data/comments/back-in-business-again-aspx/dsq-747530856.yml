message: <p>Thanks for sharing a valuable lesson with the rest of us Phil. <br>When things go wrong it's not uncommon for people and pros alike to try and pave over the facts about what really happened (especially if there's a liability or cost issue). <br>Your post above is a great reminder that it's not a question of 'if things will go wrong' - but when - and whether you'll be ready to deal with it.  You've also prompted me to make some changes where my own backup and recovery procedures are concerned - so thanks again, and good luck in getting the rest of your content back on the site.</p>
