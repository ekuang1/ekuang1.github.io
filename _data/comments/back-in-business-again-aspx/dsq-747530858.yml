message: <p>Having 1 failing hard drive taking down the server is simply LAME!<br>BAAAAD business for hosting providers. With drives so cheap anyone can afford some kind of RAID. And this has nothing to do with backups. Just a total failure on the provider part.<br>Ofc backups are good, but I STRONGLY prefer not to fail in the first place and have backups for a different reason which is historical data in case I make a fuckup overwriting the last copy of my uber important files.<br></p>
