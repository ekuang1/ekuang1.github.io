message: <p>According to Jeff's post, here:<br><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000984.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000984.html">www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000984.html</a><br>you were supposed to have 300GB raid 5 array, so did the whole raid array fail? Did you really have a raid 5 array? Did more than one drive fail?<br>Were you still using Windows 2003 or had you upgraded to Windows 2008 and Hyper-V virtualisation? Would such an upgrade have made backing up your VPS any easier?</p>
