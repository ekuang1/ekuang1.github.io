message: <p>I wouldn't say it's dead, some of it has been tightly integrated into .NET proper like JSON.NET or as a near second party like OWIN. Other parts still exist as third party, things like Nancy, Massive, and NHibernate still all exist.</p><p>You have the rise of tools like EntityFramework and it's line in the sand opposites like Dapper.NET, PetaPoco.</p><p>You still the constant foray of Microsoft into things for short terms like WebApi that has been entirely supplanted by MVC proper.</p><p>Nuget is king and one of the most important parts to .NET now. Visual Studio is getting first class support for things like bower and gulp. Roslyn is allowing tools like Sublime to intellisense-lite. I believe VS2015 will abandon mstest in favor of xUnit.</p><p>ASP.NET 5 Core CLR once again throws all existing libraries to the wind with yet another distribution for Library owners to support.</p><p>All in all it's the best time to ever be involved with .NET, as with everything there is always growing pain. For the people who come after .NET5 it will be one of the richest landscapes out there devoid of all the pain it took to build it.</p><p>Mircosoft has literally bet the farm on Azure and every single thing they're doing is all about enabling developers to build applications that run on Azure. Whether you're using C# ASP.NET or PHP or Node. Whether you want Windows VMs or Linux VMs, whether you want to deploy to Windows PAAS or linux Docker.</p>
