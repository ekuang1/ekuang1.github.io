message: <p>Hey Phil - I've been out of the .NET world for a few years now, but this sounds an awful lot like what was going on several years ago with "AltDotNet" (which I loved, and eventually helped lead me away from .NET). Is that "movement" (not sure what else to call it) dead? Is this kind of a recreation of that original premise under a new context given Microsoft's new status quo?</p>
