message: "<p>I think the premise is related but subtly different. As dotnetchris points out, many of the ideas of ALT.NET made their way into .NET proper.</p><p>I think DotNetFringe is more in-line with my thoughts I wrote a few years ago around MonkeySpace: <a href=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2012/10/21/monkeyspace-dotnet-oss.aspx/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2012/10/21/monkeyspace-dotnet-oss.aspx/\">https://haacked.com/archive/...</a></p><p>&gt; The .NET ecosystem is becoming less and less solely dependent on Microsoft and this is a good thing.</p><p>Back in the ALT.NET days, I felt like there was a lot of focus on convincing Microsoft of good design choices/alternatives that many of us held dear. For example, trying to teach Microsoft what TDD really is. Or about the benefits of POCO ORMs. And the benefits of lightweight web frameworks that don't abstract the web.</p><p>But now, I think we all take these practices for granted. We don't need to do any more convincing. Instead, with DotNetFringe, we can focus on exploring new ideas together and shedding light on lesser known .NET OSS people and projects.</p><p>I personally want to look at what it takes to get to the next level of an OSS ecosystem that enthusiastically welcomes Microsoft, but doesn't absolutely need it to survive. We may not be there yet, but it'll be fun to work towards that! :)</p><p>But as an important clarification, I don't want Microsoft to go away. I'm only saying, it should be one of many participants in a healthy ecosystem.</p>"
