message: <p>Phil is correct. .NET Fringe is an event, it is not a movement. ALT.NET was a movement focused on changing Microsoft. This event is focused on the community and seeing how it is running with the ball based on a lot of the changes that did happen. I expect you will see a lot of ideas that resonated with ALT.NET at the conference, but not because they are ALT.NET, it is because those ideas have become part of the communal mindset. This event is about progress in the commnity and looking to the future.</p>
