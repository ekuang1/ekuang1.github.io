message: <p>I would have loved to sit in on the scripting talk.  I have found that I am finding more and more uses for hosting PowerShell scripting within my web apps as a way to allow users to add custom behavior and logic.  I love the ease with which PowerShell can hosted and it's ability to seamlessly work with both .Net, WMI and COM code.</p>
