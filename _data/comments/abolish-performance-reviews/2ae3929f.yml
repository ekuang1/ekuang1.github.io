  Very good. Thank you. The only thing, oddly, that I'm left wondering....is the premise of those studies...



  For example, why should be expect men and women to be equally 'abrasive'? ....It's hard to get it right because of the unexamined assumptions behind so much research...The research and all of its conclusions are really just an indicator of the researcher's expectations...(just like the reviewers they are looking at!!!!)



  Ha!...but I agree with the article in general.
