  Phil, I agree with you but I think you've failed to mention the real point behind the performance reviews these days:  HR and Legal.



  So many companies use these as their "backup" in the case that a dismissed employee files a grievance of some sort.  It is seen as "documentation" that the person was warned, and had ample time to improve before being let go.



  I think a company wants to frame the performance review in a positive light, but that's just double-speak when the real goal is to use it as a hammer or as insurance.
