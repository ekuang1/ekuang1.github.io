  The problem is not the existence of performance reviews.  The problem is how poorly they are done and the shallow thinking that goes into them.



  A merit-based system is the best because it provides incentive to do well.  A merit-based system does not innately discourage innovation and the implementation of beneficial new ideas.



  I understand many of the younger employees are not used to being told their idea is worthless and that they are not putting in the effort they should.  But they need to hear it when it is true.  They need to realize how little they know and how much they can learn from more experienced employees.



  If a performance review system is not working like it should, fix it or replace the management (and HR) that screwed it up.
