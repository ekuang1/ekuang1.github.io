message: "Executives, managers, HR, and finance use performance reviews for almost everything except performance; but it helps to put a name on the exercise that makes the employees think they are under scrutiny. Indeed, they rarely play any part in the cycle of incompetence known as the \"Annual Review.\"\r\n\r\nHR requires reason to terminate. Managers need to have high numbers to inflate their corporate opportunities. Finance uses reviews to manage budgets. Even executives cite the (bogus) numbers when they argue for changes in their departments or areas of interest.\r\n\r\nEliminating the annual performance review throws management into a very deep pit from which they cannot escape. Directing peer reviews exposes the manager as nothing more than a scribe or facilitator. (You don't need very many of those in an organization. Certainly not as many as the number of middle managers.) Eliminating incentives undercuts the only real power the manager has over the underling. \r\n\r\nTo be a real participant in the corporate process requires real-time and up-to-date knowledge of the tasks -- something that few managers ever have, and something that formerly-technical people who become managers lose very quickly. I've never met a manger who thought s/he could manage without the stick and carrot.\r\n\r\nBut this speaks to the whole fallacy of the modern technical industry: we don't need managers; we need leaders. We need pathfinders, mentors, experienced producers, and sage advisers in every group. And all we get is middle managers. \r\n\r\nAbsent leadership, every team under-performs, regardless of the management instruments provided by HR or the executives. \r\n\r\nBut with an annual performance review, we can blame all our performance failures on the folks who never had a say in their environment.\r\n\r\n"
