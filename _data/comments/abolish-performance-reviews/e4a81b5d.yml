  Great resource; thanks for putting this together!



  My favourite performance review story, about worker W, W's manager M, and M's director D.



  W is not doing well on M's team, and M is concerned. W has a great set of skills that are not being used in their current role.  But wait! M has an idea. Team X in the same division has open headcount and needs someone with W's skills.  We'll move W to team X, open up a head on M's team, and hire someone who has the skills needed to make M's team a success. So M puts this plan into effect and W moves over to team X, and coincidentally worker N is available to transfer to M's team, who has the skills needed. Management success!



  D comes to M's office and says "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? I was going to tell you to shaft W at review time.  Now we have to find someone else to shaft, because the review system requires that every team have at least one "goat" that gets a bad performance review. Don't you know that you always need a goat on your team? Go figure out which of your high performers won't quit when we give them a below-average review and no bonus, OH I KNOW, HOW ABOUT THE NEW GUY?"



  Take a guess as to what company this was at, Phil. I think you can get it in one. :-)
