message: <p>Last night I was suffering from a little insomnia so I decided to sit down and test the Subtext 1.9.2 codeset... and you know what - it was very relaxing and rewarding! <br>I uncovered (and fixed) several bugs related to installation, importing dotTEXT blogs, and some UI issues in the HostAdmin section. And when 2 a.m. rolled around I felt like I had done some good in the world and I was ready for a good night's sleep.<br>Now, if I could just find 3-4 hrs every day to commit to Subtext I'd be the happiest and best slept guy around!<br><em>NOTE:</em> Phil, CoComment doesn't seem to be working quite right on your site. None of the comments that I've submitted the past few days are showing up on <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/comments/ussherm" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cocomment.com/comments/ussherm">my CoComment page</a>. Nor am I getting the CoComment pop-up that says "Your comment has been submitted to CoComment".</p>
