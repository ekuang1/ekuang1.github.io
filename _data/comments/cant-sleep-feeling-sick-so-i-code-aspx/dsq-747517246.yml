message: <p>Funny article Phil! Some of my friends and relatives think I spend too much time at the computer. Being a scientifically minded person, I decided to do some experiements. Over the last few months I have been using an accurate instrument to measure an important physiological parameter of my health. To my surprise, I found out that programming on a project I enjoy creates very positive measurements on this health parameter. Even programming for long periods of time without stopping to eat has produced measurements that indicate a very good state of health. On the other hand, some of the worst measurements have also been associated with computer use - for example, after reading stressful emails from my boss about bad news related to the company I work for.<br>Given what you said, I would bet that it could be shown that programming on Subtext is good for your health! ;)</p>
