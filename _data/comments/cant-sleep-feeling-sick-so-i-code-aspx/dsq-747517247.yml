message: <p>I've the same experience... when I'm sad or feel depressed, working on ST is better than Prozac or Xanax (Phil, now if you start earning 15$ per click on this page... you know who to thanks :-))<br>Too bad (at least for my company) working on my real job code doesn't have the same effect ;-)</p>
