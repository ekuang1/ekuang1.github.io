message: <p>Good job Phil,<br>Everybody who sees SubText, abbreciate your work.<br>I was studing in a university far from my home with different weather.  Doctor said I should use <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682159.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682159.html">Ibuprofen</a> and yes, it helped me to sleep at first nights when I was coming back from university.</p>
