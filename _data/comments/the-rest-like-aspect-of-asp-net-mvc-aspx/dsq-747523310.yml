message: "<p>Another point of interest is that an ASP.NET MVC framework was demanded by a very loud and vocal minority that does not represent the whole <a href=\"http://asp.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"asp.net\">asp.net</a> community: ayende, connery guy, the <a href=\"http://codebetter.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"codebetter.com\">codebetter.com</a> bloggers, etc. <br>Nearly all of that genre are consultants...the MVC Rails-like framework fits there requirements: fast, easy development,   etc. They can pick and chose the projects they want to work on, so when integration with legacy systems is not a concern this model fits.<br>One thing I have read over and over is that the webforms model is too complex, etc, etc: \"A Leaky Abstraction\". I think is its rather simple myself and even elegant. I have seen a lot of developers who abuse Page_Load and use it as a continuous block or procedural code...but that is not a flaw in the design, but in the developers. I mean if they can abuse Page_Load, I am sure they will abuse (if they even understand) an MVC pattern.<br>However sick and tired I am of listening to the MVC/Rails punch, drunk blogger/consultants that are pushing this framework, I'll be sure to use it in a fitting project ASAP. Not because I feel that its better than the traditional webforms model, but because I now have no choice: in this profession its learn or die...<br></p>"
