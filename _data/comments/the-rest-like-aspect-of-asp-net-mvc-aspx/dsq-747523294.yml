message: <p>With all due respect to Dino for his extensive experience in web development on many platforms, I think that it's a step in the wrong direction to start the REST-is-the-main-apsect-of-the-framework conversations before the framework is even ready for public consumption, let alone ready for use in production CLR web apps, where it will generate real, actionable heuristic feedback.<br>If the ASP .NET MVC framework delivers a web developer experience on the order of the Rails experience, then it's success will be traceable to the developer community's understanding that the power comes from recognizing the value of all of the framework's subsystems, and the knowledge and perspective that allows individual developers to wield all of the framework's aspects simultaneously with equal ability.<br>We get the most out of frameworks like Rails - and hopefully ASP .NET MVC - by harvesting the emergent value that comes from adeptly unifying the framework's various aspect into a single charge into a web app's problem domain.</p>
