message: <p>Yes this is a problem that I've noticed.  Once a blog receives alot of traffic you can forget about it. <br><br><br><br>It's really sad that this has happenned.  There is a blog that I go to daily and they must get spammed from some kind of bot.  It's all in chinesse and it's the same each time.  Why I know it's a bot is because each time it hits the blog it adds the spam to each blog entry.  So if you if had 3 blog entries there would be one comment in the first entry, 2 in the second, and 3 in the third, etc... Each time is spidered the site, it added spam to every possible blog entry. <br><br><br><br>It's really too bad!</p>
