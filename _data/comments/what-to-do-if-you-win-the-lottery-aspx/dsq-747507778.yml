message: <p>Well I have read most of the comments here. It's unlikely that many of you know the value of 1 million pounds. It definitely will NOT be enough for you to build a resort somewhere. I am a past winner of the lottery and the first thing I did was to buy a new house and 2 cars. After that I realised that money was being spent so quickly that it was just vanishing. So I employed a personal accountant who's now also my financial consultant. I started investing in the stock market, and got lucky on a couple of 10 baggers. Now I own one of the companies I invested in (Afren plc). I highly recommend investing in the stock market before it's too late.</p>
