message: <p>I'd pay off all my debts... which right now would be $1000 in credit card bills, and about $10,000 in school loans. I'd pay off both of my parents morgages, and give them a good amount of money. I give my sister something incredibly nice, since she has done so much for me, and if she decided to get married, i would make sure she would have the best wedding ever (even if shes not into that stuff).<br>I would still drive my 96 grand am until it shit out on me. Ok.. maybe i would buy a souped up scion tc for the side... in lime green.. <br>I would live in a sweet three bedroom apartment in Boston, and let two of my closets (and now luckiest friends) live there rent free. Ok.. they can pay for the electric bill and maybe cable.  I'd go to grad school there alsooo. <br>If i had any extra money, i would buy a real popular club that a lot of doucebags go to, and stand at the door and make sure they werent let in.</p>
