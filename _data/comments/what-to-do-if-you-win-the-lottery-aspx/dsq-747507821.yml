message: <p>To win the lottery would be such a fulfilment, there would be no worries about a job and the stressful life associated with one. Freedom of money will lend an opportunity to explore the world and gain more knowledge and insight into the environment and cultures people live by. My first action would be to give a portion of money to family and friends, especially to my parents whom I sometimes worry about, I would buy a nice house and design the whole interior. I'd spend my time reading books of subjects i'm interested in, learn to be multi-lingual then travel the world in seeing how I could help other people from less economically developed countries, making sure they have the basic needs to survive like food, shelter and warmth. I'd work closely with charities and help with their projects using manual labour if needed. The ultimate goal is to be happy by knowing that i've made a difference to other peoples lives with the use of the power of money in which this world has.</p>
