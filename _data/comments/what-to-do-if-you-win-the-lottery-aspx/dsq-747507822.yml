message: <p>I would continue doing what I am doing now making my property environmentally friendly and creating a permaculture paradise for me and my family. Working on Art and Music. Only all of this in a bigger way. Start some businesses related to improving the environment and to the arts. <br>I would NOT be donating to charities. Most charities stand for things I am blatantly against like over population and such. Nope not giving money to a charities so they can give it to people who are irresponsible in their breeding. <br>The money can be best served improving my own life and making my little peice of the world evironmentally friendly. In the long run it will do more good for the Planet as a whole. <br>Luckily my family is small so I wouldn't have to deal with a bunch of pests with their hands out either. <br></p>
