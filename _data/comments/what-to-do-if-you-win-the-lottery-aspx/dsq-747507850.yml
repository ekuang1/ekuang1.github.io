message: <p>How small minded we are as we struggle in our little cages within the Matrix. How about taking the money and educating the people about the Federal Reserve banking system and what a complete sham it really is. How about buying billboard spots all across America, displaying the futility of "trying to get ahead", when ultimately the paper money is worthless and only they can create or shrink the value of it accordingly. Lets talk about the New World Order, RFID chips, loss of Sovereignty, and use those lottery winnings to unmask the people who really control this country and consequently the world. Its time to wake up... Its time to take the red pill...Only gold and silver is lawful money. All paper currencies eventually self-destruct. As for me, yes I would crusade across this country doing lectures for the people in an attempt to wake them up.  At least until the Power Structure had me killed, which eventually would happen. The rest of my "PAPER MONEY" would be traded for gold and silver, just like the owners of the Fed do. Yes, the Rothschilds, Morgans, Rockefellers, Warburgs, etc. They ALL have substantial holdings in REAL money. They are not stupid. You shouldn't be either.</p>
