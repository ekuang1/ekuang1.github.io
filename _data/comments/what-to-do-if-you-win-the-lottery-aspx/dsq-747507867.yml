message: <p>if i won the lottery, first of all i would pay my school tution, buy a brand new car, and a house. And also since i'm engaged i will have the most beautiful wedding ever. Secondly i will pay off my mom's mortage, pay off my fiancee's parents mortage, and buy my fiancee a car as well. The rest of the money i will invest in real estate, open up some stores (i don't really know yet) for future generations.</p>
