message: <p>I would tithe ten percent @ the pre-tax rate to my church and my father's church.<br>  Then, I have a designated amount going to twenty people close to me.  <br>  Next, I will put all my cash into a CD, take a leave of absence from work, contact a financial planner, a lawyer, change my address to a P. O. Box number; remembering not to use a "change of address" notification through the USPS, for, they sell information for commercially-related matters.<br>  During the leave of absence, I will practice isolation and maintaining that my announcement concerning my financial gains not be necessary.<br>  Oh, by the way, if I am divorced I would get an agreement prepared with my "ex" which stipulates not to pursue me should I win a lottery.<br>  Don't forget to thank the Almighty for your new income.  Plus, ask Him to give you guidance to make the correct decisions to make your windfall last.  <br></p>
