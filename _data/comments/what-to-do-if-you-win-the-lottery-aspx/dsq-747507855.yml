message: <p>When I win the lottery on July 7, 2007. I plan to pay off all of my bills and my husband's bills. I plan to donate at least 10-15% to charity and to my needy relatives. The remaining portion will be use to purchase some land to build a house. I would use at least 25%-50% as a down payment. Then, I would save at least 10%-20% and invest at least 10%-20%. The other 5% would be use to splurge a little and take a vacation.</p>
