message: <p>i know for sure that i will win the lottery Jackpot? How? well, first you need to have faith in the lord. i'm talking about Jesus Christ, our father, which most of you don't accept as your father. There is nothing impossible for him to do. In other words, there is nothing he couldn't do unless he doesn't want to do it. I see all People who are dreaming of winning the lottery but they can't win no matter how hard they tried. There can be a reason that those people don't win the lottery. Maybe god don't make them win for a reason. Many people who dreamed of winning the lottery always say something they can't keep. They made promises that they would give charity, help poor and buy friends house. But alot of them won't do it for sure if they win. here is my peace of advice for anyone reading this right now. First, do not think about winning the lottery to often because it can destroy your dream. If you thinking about winning the lottery so much, you would lose your interest and starting to fall down. Secondly, believe in god and pray each night before you go to bed and you will see how everything will go well for you. Third, do have to much ambition. If you see someone hit the jackpot, do not get jealous because it was their times. Lastly, if you make a promise, you have to keep your promise. because eventhough you win and if you don't do what you said you was going to do, your money will go badly. You will think that you have a bad luck as thing is bad for you. Good Luck ya all.<br>                                                              <br></p>
