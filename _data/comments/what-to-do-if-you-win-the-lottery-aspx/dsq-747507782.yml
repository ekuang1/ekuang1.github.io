message: <p>I would hire a laywer and financial planner, from a blind trust before I collected the money. Also a security company and change my phone number. <br>Anyone who came asking for money from me just because I happened to win the lottery and they heard about it would be refused no matter if their need or cause was legitimate. They would not get one dime whatsoever. <br>Anyone wanting a business venture capital would be out of luck to because I have my own ideas on businesses that I would start as time went by too many to list here. <br>House and property would be paid off...... and spend a bit of time indulging after most was put into investments to gain more cash to put into action my plans for businesses I would want to start eventually and those would be started as situations allowed. <br>I wouldn't be giving huge sums to friends and family..... nope not at all..... cos most were not their for me when I needed stuff. Yeah at one time I had to eat in soup kitchen's  and work at labour ready and no one was helping me out. F**k them. <br>If I do help out people or charities it would be on my own terms... and I will repeat now. Any charity or person coming to me and askig me for cash will be turned down regardless of their need....... no exceptions.  <br>For all you all know I could already have won the lottery and that is why I am looking up "You've just won the lottery now what?"....... so if any of you chairty folks out there are reading this remember this that lottery winners don't want you harassing them and some won't give you a dime of their winnings......</p>
