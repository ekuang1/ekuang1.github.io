message: '<p>The first thing I would do is, pay off all debts, for me and my son, then for all of my brothers and there families. I want to make sure that there is enough money set aside for my handicapped son, that he will never need any kind of other financial aid the rest of his life, after I am gone. I also want to move my small metal shop into a 10,000 square foot building, with heated floors, there I will continue to build my (DREAM) business bigger. I want to tell my place of employment this quote: After going over my finances I have discovered that I can no long be employed with you. So I am sorry to let you go!, then I want to see there expressions on there faces!!!. I also want to make sure that my Mother lives very comfortly the rest of her days. I would like to have a shrine built for my Father, for he was a good man, and his life taken early. I want all to remember him, and his family. His dreams was crushed early. Then I want to build a huge log cabin on about 100+ acres. It will have a huge living room, with very tall windows, surrounding a natural stone fireplace, with fire place tools that I made in my shop. It will have a secondary apartment closely built for Aids, and there families to live for my son. Will also be a big entainment room, with a 8 foot real slate pool table. So my friends could come over for a theraphy session once a week.......funny!<br>I guess I even thought about making sure the church I go to would be maintained better, than it is now, set up a trust fund to take care of the churchs, and their cemetaries. I want to make sure that the local fire companies, have the most updated cloths and equipment. I will give to those that are less forunate, and try to make there life a little easier. I will always that God to for giving me the winning numbers.</p>'
