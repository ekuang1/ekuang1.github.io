message: <p>If I won the lottery, I would hire a lawyer to help me decide how much I could spend and what I should invest. <br>I would help family and a few close friends. I would give money to charities I am interested in. I would make sure everyone I loved had good health care insurance. <br>I would dream of great things but keep my spending reasonable to make my money last a long time.</p>
