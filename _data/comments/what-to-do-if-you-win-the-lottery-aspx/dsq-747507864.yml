message: <p>If I won the lottery say 25 million--  I would keep it quiet for a while, while I figured out what I was going to do with the money. I would like to provide for family members. All my parents siblings and their  children. My siblings and mother would get 1 million. My brothers children would get 500,000 in trust for them for when they are 21 years of age. <br>I would buy a three bedrooom condo in Puerto Rico in Isle Verde -- something simple off the beach .Family members could use it to vacation. Maybe I would rent it out when i wasn't there. I also would buy a large condominium in New York. I would buy into a bldg  that had a pool and fitness center in it. <br>I have friends I grew up with that would be helped as well. One who is not talking to me now. If she still wanted to stew about whatever,then she wouldn't get a thing. Ofcourse she wouldnt know about the money first hand. I guess I am being petty. FOur friends would recieve 10 to 20 thousand. <br>I wouldn't spend all the money...recklessly. I am a simple person and would just enjoy the luxury of being able to enjoy my life. I would be on a yearly budget, I don;t plan to be on the E channel and be one of the bad luck winners. <br>I would set up some money in trust to help family members send their kids to college. I consider it a large responsibity to have my relatives to share in the lottery. After all what would be the fun if you could drink champagne and you had cousins who were struggling to keep a roof over their heads. <br>Oh for me, I would have a large house-- condo and have more cats...yeah yeah I am single. All the animals would be adopted from shelters. <br>Oh and one of the charites i would set up is to help poor families <br>get vet care for their animals. <br>Guess, all of this would be changed more or less according to the amount I won. GIve or take 5 million.</p>
