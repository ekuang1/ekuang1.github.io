message: <p>If I won a million euros, the first thing I would do after screaming and shouting is buy an average house with a big garden and a swimming pool.Inside the house it will be like a luxury house with a jacuzzi, a lot of computers, a little cinema with a bar were you can have many candy and drinks.<br><br>Also I will buy a dreamcar a very cool and fast car like a ferari, a lamborgihni or an aston martin.I will buy also a lot of clothes, a new gsm and a kitchen with a lot of food inside the fridge. The rest of my money I will put it on the bank and hopely it bring up. <br><br></p>
