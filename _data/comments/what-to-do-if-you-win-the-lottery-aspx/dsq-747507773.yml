message: <p>Well, firstly after yelling and screaming with joy and confusion and saying thank you god a million times, I would buy a really nice house and have it nicely decorated like those on the movie 'extreme makeover'. My home will have a movie theater cos i love movies, I am also a playstation and pc game freak so I will have the latest games and the most high tech of computers. I would buy my mum, dad and younger brother a really nice big house, and buy my parents some rental properties so they can stop working as they are really stressed out and need a break. <br><br>I would give some cash to my brothers who are living overseas so they can enjoy their ventures alot more, and I would buy my nanna and grandad a nice homeand my partners nana and grandad a nice home also. I would buy a lambourghini for my self and a dodge viper for my partner.<br><br>With the money left I would most definately invest and set up trusts and a will to protect our winnings so they go to our two children (one who is currently an expectant baby) and adopted children which I would love to have too.<br><br>I would also donate money to those in need, something I would love to do but I am too poor :(</p>
