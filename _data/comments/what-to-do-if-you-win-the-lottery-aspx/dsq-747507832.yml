message: <p>If I won the lottery, I would most deffinatly by my self a big beautiful house in the country side with lots of land, buy a Big SUV, a large pickup truck, and then a car. I would give each Parent 1 Million, I would then buy apartment complexes and rent out to people (more money coming in) , Each of my 6 brothers and sisters would have their college tuition paid for if and only if they actually go and are passing. Donate some to St. Judes, Then save the rest...I would still be working though b/c I cannot just quit working.</p>
