message: <p>With my lottery win of 8 million...i am giving my ex-husband a million....seeing our kids through university and giving a lot to charities such as stop cruelty to children and animals. My daughter is learning to drive so i am buying her a mini cooper. I really want my dad to stop working so this will be a great opportunity for him to stop.(hes stillis working but very part-time). I am paying off all my sisters and brothers mortgages, loans and credit cards. We are all looking forward to our nice get-together holiday and spending some quality time catching up. I'm in the process of buying a beautiful house with a turn-a-round drive........i am truly grateful for all this.</p>
