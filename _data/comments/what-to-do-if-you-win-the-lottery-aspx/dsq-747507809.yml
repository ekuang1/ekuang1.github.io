message: <p>what i would do with a lottery win depends largely on HOW MUCH i win. so, if it were a huge amount, i'd be able to set up a trust for my mom, my son, my sister and take care of friends.<br>after hiring the attorney, setting up the blind trust and pay off all debt and figuring out what type of financial lifestyle i realistically can deal with then i'd do the fun stuff:<br>get a big house built in the country, in toronto, london, japan, and france. travel like crazy until i couldn't stand it, attend all the film festivals, learn to cook gourmet, open a restaurant, invest my money, live quietly and happy.</p>
