message: <p>I would seek out a plan to make sure I never ever ever have to work under the thumb of corporate America ever again.  I would go back to school to get the extra useful education I have long for. <br>Materially I do have few wants. I would want to buy a new home, one that would use less energy.  My current home would be fixed up and sold at a extra fair price to a good family.  <br>There are a few friends of mine who were maimed by corporate America and they would get some aid from me.  Even though I despise Corporate America, I would leave my current job gracefully.  <br>I would probably buy my wife a new good used car even if I could afford to buy a new one.  We would both feel that we would need to use the extra funds to help the less fortunate.</p>
