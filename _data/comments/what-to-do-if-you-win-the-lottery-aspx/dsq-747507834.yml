message: <p>I woundn't change much about my life.  Of course pay of debts.  Give some money to close family members.  Invest enough to live off and ensure financial security for a lifetime.  I like the car I own and house I live in just fine.  Here's the thing if I won a huge lottery like over 100 million I don't need all that money, no one does.  I would set up a fund that would provide interest free loans to people in my community who are interested in using alternative energy in their homes.  The initial investment for solar or wind power is more than most middle class people can manage.  This way they pay monthly as they would have with traditional means.   If you have something like this that you're passionate about it helps deal with people asking for money.  You can say, actually I could use some more funds for my project, are you interested?  I fully realize this would be challenging to implement, but it seriously irritates me that so many wealthy people spend so much of their money buying more stuff. Also I find it frustrating that the people who can afford to build an energy efficient home  instead choose to spend the money on more square footage which takes more fossil fuels to heat.</p>
