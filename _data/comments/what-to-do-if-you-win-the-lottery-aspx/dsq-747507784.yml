message: <p>first thing i would do, is arrange for a bank account just for this money alone, i would want Annuity, to ensure i do not go wild and spend it all.<br>I would give my parents a heck of a nice retirement fund (100k)a year, they had done so much for me and it would put my mind at ease finanically and medically speaking and lots of fun.<br>Being a nice brother i am, i would arrange for my siblings, to recieve small(75k) yearly payments, providing they stay out of jail, and drugs.<br>any members in my family wishing they can go to college, will recieve funds, and if the grades are really great, nice spring breaks.<br>i would set up a investment fund, to ensure we would be set after the lottery payments ended.<br>charities, well GOD help me win, so i would do my bit for man kind. food and medicine for starving and deprived children, cancer fund, and an animal shelter.<br>As for my self, i want a small farm with a river or a pond in it for myself and my dogs. maybe 2 nice vacations a year. I would be happy to recieve 100k a year for myself, and invest and do all the things above.</p>
