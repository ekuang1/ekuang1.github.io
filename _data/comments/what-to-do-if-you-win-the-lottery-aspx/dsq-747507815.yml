message: <p>I would concur with the author of the article  by saying that the lottery for me would ultimately lead to more time learning and basically doing what I want.  I feel that too many people in this day and age spend too much of their time just trying to get by.  Working just so that they can put food on the table and have a roof over their head.  What a terrible way to live.  What a waste of a life.  I don't want to live like that.    <br><br>So the lottery to me would be something that  frees up my time to live life the way I would want.  The author although brings up a good point in that regardless of where you are in life we can do what we want to do, although at a much lesser degree than if money wasn't a limiting factor.  But we can do certain things and many people do.  For me this is where my energies would focus after winning the lottery:<br><br>1.) Pay off all personal debts<br><br>2.) Ccncentrate on my physical health (personal trainer, good food, doctors visits, etc), ...i've neglected all of this because of lack of money<br><br>-My life wouldn't change any really other a few basic areas like this.  Probably spend alot more time reading.  If I were to endulge myself I probably take a cruise around the world or maybe I would just go live in some far away spot in the mountains.  The thought of winning the lottery is an encouraging thought for all of us because in some ways it is a sort of ticket to freedom.  Have a good day.</p>
