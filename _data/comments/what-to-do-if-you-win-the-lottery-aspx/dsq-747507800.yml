message: <p>I'm 17 and have a lot of dreams but have not enough money to implement them. So if I won a lottey I would buy my parents a nice house in another country, pay off my and my uncle's bills,  give some money on charity, i would run away from Poland to another country (USA, England or New Zeeland) and go there to school and study there. I love animals so I would give some money to animal shelter. I would also go travelling around the world... India, China, Russia, Germany, France etc. :) :) I would take my family from Poland and live with them in countries i've already written.<br>;* PEOPLE! TAKE CARE! EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE ALRIGHT! *;</p>
