message: <p>I would set up a blind trust to claim the winnings, get a financial planner, get things set up, not telling anyone other than the planner and my lawyer.  I would get my prize, invest it, open several bank accounts and give notice at work (as if I was looking for work elsewhere).  I would not tell anyone except maybe my parents.  My aunts have done a good job at alienating my immediate family from the rest of the family, so I would take great pleasure in telling family exactly where to go if word ever got out.  I would take college courses in different areas than I got my Master's in, maybe drama!  I would definitely travel a lot more, and give generously to the local animal shelters.  I would also invest in a top-of-line security and surveillance system of my house and environs.  I would get an unlisted number.  I would not get a boat/expensive car/second house/plane or any of the other trappings that wealthy people seem to need to surround themselves with.  I would probably get a nice, big-screen TV for the living room.  I would set up a trust so that my neice could go to the college of her choice without worrying about cost.</p>
