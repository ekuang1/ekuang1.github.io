message: <p>The thing I think about is if I won the lottery, then after like ten years I would get bored of travel and cocaine and charity, and the money would be getting relatively low, and I would probably want to do something with my life.  The trick is to figure out what that is and then make that my career, even if I don't win the lottery.  But I'll keep playing anyway as I work towards that goal.</p>
