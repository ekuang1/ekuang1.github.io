message: <p>If I won the big one.......of course my husband would know , we would find a great attaoney and take it from there. We would tell no one of our good luck. Our children and grandchildren would be well taken care of but done in a way where they would know nothing of our luck.<br>We have gone so long without so many things it would be easy for us.<br>i am sure we wwould travel more often and stay longer.<br>Ther are a couple of charietes that would hear from us. We would not like all the bother that comes to many that win, all the more reason to keep our business with us alone.<br>It would be wonderful to win but life has been good to us. We atre healthy and love each other very much. It is almost forty years for us and would do it all over again the same way with the same struggles.<br>Goog luck to all of us</p>
