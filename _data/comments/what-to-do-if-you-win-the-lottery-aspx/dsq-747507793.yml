message: "<p>PAY OFF THE BILLS, GET A CUSTOM BIKE (can you say \"OCC\"), BUY A BIG PICKUP (CRX!!), AND BUILD THE HOUSE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED (huge and in the middle of nowhere with a tall fence)!!!!<br>All that wouldn't take too long, so then I'd start taking care of those who've taken care of my family &amp; I over the years: Parents, Brother, &amp; friends!<br>I'd pay back my parents and my in-laws by either outright giving them a huge lump sum or by buying them each their choice of retirement property (whether it be land &amp; house, or whether it be an RV, houseboat, etc).<br>Then I'd buy my brother a custom chopper so we could tour the country together on our Hogs, and his own big rig so he could stop driving for everyone else and drive for himself (if he still wanted to work after I made a rich man out of him, too).<br>I'd work all this in with some donations to Church &amp; Charity, though I'm not sure which ones I'd give to (wouldn't be very many, just the ones that have something to do with stuff that's happened in my life; for example, a lymphoma research company would get some so they could help prevent deaths such as happened to my brother-in-law).<br>I'd follow all that up by helping out as many of my friends as I could; that is, the deserving ones that have helped me out over the years. Although that could turn out to be a LOOOOOONG list, I'd do what I could.<br>Then I'd bank the rest and live off the interest and start a few college funds for the kids (mine and maybe some friends kids).<br>Travel up north and see all my cousins, aunts, &amp; uncles that I haven't been able to visit since I was a teenager; tour the country in an RV; finally build my dream model railroad; complete my coin collection.....<br>It'll probably never happen, but I can sure dream, can't I?</p>"
