message: <p>I would buy all the Walmarts and stop them from taking over the world!<br>(That was a joke...)<br>I would give it to my parents (I don't have a choice, I'm 13) who would set up a fund thingy for me.<br>I would see if they'd let me buy a laptop, which I'd really like, but other than that, I'd go with my mother's idea.<br>I would start a company that loans people money so they can buy stuff that's slows down global warming (can't remember what it's called), and employ my 'friends'.<br>I really don't have many friends.<br>I would also try to let them send me to Chattanooga, Tennessee, to visit my friend that I haven't seen since we moved.<br>After that...well, I don't know. But I do know I'd think about everything.<br>Considering what I've read here, I think it'd be okay if I did win the lottery.<br>I mean, the people who've posted here can't even spell!
