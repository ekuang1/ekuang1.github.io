message: "<p>@Braden: True, and after re-reading my comment I realize I came off like a jackass. Blame the 3 straigh 12+ hour days I've had ;-).<br>But since you brought up MS...whenever they release a so called 'critical' patch, they don't spell out how to exploit it, they just say \"could allow an attacker to take control of a machine\" blah blah blah. I realize that in the OSS world, being transparent is a necessity, but had this been a large software package I wrote for a client, they would not have been happy had I published the steps needed for an attacker to take advantage of an exploit. Not happy at all.</p>"
