message: "<p>Thanks for the heads up and for the patch which fixes the problem.  <br>I've applied the painless-to-apply-patch to my site and all's well again.<br>Best -<br>Braden<br>P.S.  In response to Jason's comment:   Jason, those who are already running Subtext should already have the know-how to make sure that their web servers and all corresponding web applications such as Subtext are properly patched in the first place.  Sort of like what we all do during \"Black Tuesday,\" right?  :-)</p>"
