message: <p>That is one curious little boy! lol  I would agree that the roots of BreakBeat is Hip Hop for sure.  As for who invented rap, I have read the same thing, which is that "Rapper's Delight" was the first rap song ever released.  As for a majority of the music talked about on this post, I'm with Phil in saying "turn up the volume"!!!</p>
