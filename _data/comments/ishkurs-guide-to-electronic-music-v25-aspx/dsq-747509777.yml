message: <p>So is it controversial who invented rap?  Originally I thought it was some Jamaican in NY who mixed two records together in the late 70's, early 80's.  You say it was Blondie and I've also googled it and others have said when Sugarhill Gang released "Rapper's Delight" in 1979, it was the first rap song.</p>
