message: <p>What most version number scheme immediately, and conviniently, forget is the murky depths of maintenance where branches are born and grow into tangling webs of versions.<br>I'm very much in favor of having the two first digits "mean" something, especially for compatibility, but I wouldn't put any stop to how many milli, micro, nano version points to have after that. Although they don't say anything special they tell me (i.e. developers) how this version came to be and what to expect or not bugfix wise.</p>
