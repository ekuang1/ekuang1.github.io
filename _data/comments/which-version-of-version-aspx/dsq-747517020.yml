message: <p>i am a fan of major.minor.update.release-date <br>for example v3.20.10.090225 (feb 25 of 2009) <br>and i make each update worth about at lest 7 to 10 changes to the code for example rewiriting a code block or fixing a minor bug and when i have made 100 updates i move the minor number up one so if v1.0.x reaches v1.00.99 the next would be v1.01.00 and when v1.01.x gets 100 updates it is at 1.02.x unless a major rewrite updates it higher anyway thats my thoughts</p>
