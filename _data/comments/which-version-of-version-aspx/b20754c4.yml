  I am not sure how you would differentiate between major.minor[.revision[.build]] and

  major.minor[.build[.revision]] anyways. It's essentially recompilation of the code right. A new build is getting generated.

   I like to follow major.minor[.build[.revision]]. I am mostly concerned with Major.minor changes.
