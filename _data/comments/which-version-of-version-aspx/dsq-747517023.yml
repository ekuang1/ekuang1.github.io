message: <p>I maintain a database application and I'm a fan of major.minor.date.time.  But in my case, major and minor refer to the database; date and time refer to the code.<br>major - I've created a new table in the database.<br>minor - I've changed the layout of the database somehow, or I've added content to my static tables.<br>date - date the code was compiled into the update (yyMMdd).<br>time - time the code was compiled into the update (hhmmss).<br></p>
