message: <p>It's still very dangerous no matter what you as long as there is an action to delete records from the DB. I can simply type in the address bar of the browser after the document is loaded<br>Javascript:$.post('/Home/Delete/1'); and it will delete.<br>Mind you every thing you put in the page is exposed wheather it's a hidden field or whatever. Javascripst is not good if you allow it to handle operations that should be made on the server side.<br>You should not use Ajax or Javascript to delete anything from the DB. it's very risky and it is EXPOSED</p>
