message: <p>Phil, you could easily render a form with nothing but a submit button:<br>&lt;form method="post"&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Confirm delete" /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;<br>This would render in the delete action when accessed with GET - i.e. browsers without javascript. So there would be no need to use javascript to submit the form; nobody with javascript would see it.</p>
