message: <p>Agreed with Chad Myers on the better way to write this code...<br>BUT, this JavaScript doesn't provide any security at all. All I have to put on my evil page is a 1 pixel iframe with a form that auto posts on load to that URL.<br>Isn't this the point of the Anti-Request Forgery token thingy you guys have in the framework or futures?</p>
