message: <p>I'm just trying to teach myself C++ from Sams teach yoursel in 21 days, third edition bought it new but ran into a Now I know was a very simple problem and put it away for years now I have another  issue and refuse to quit. There is a paragraph in the book that I don't know how to type because I can't make the small characters  that mean to the power of but here is one I can cut and paste....<br>  As you know, the decimal system uses the digits 0-9 to represent numbers. If we wanted to put a larger number in column 10^n (e.g., 10), we would have to multiply 10*10^n, which would give 10^(n+1), and be carried a column to the left. For example, putting ten in the 10^0 column is impossible, so we put a 1 in the 10^1 column, and a 0 in the 10^0 column, thus using two columns. Twelve would be 12*10^0, or 10^0(10+2), or 10^1+2*10^0, which also uses an additional column to the left (12). Now my issue WHAT does the small n mean I can't find it anywhere and feel like I have to know to move on. Please help if you will. Thank You to 10th power.</p>
