message: <p>I tried to end a checking account at the end of the year and start another one.  It's been 6 months, I've given up balancing the new one, now I'm trying to piece together the old one.  It's got 6 years worth of checking in it.  It's getting to damn big!  Anybody with this kind of money (microsoft) should be using it to help their customer out!  Hell I might even think about buying full versions of their software if the would SUPPORT it.  Rat Bastards!</p>
