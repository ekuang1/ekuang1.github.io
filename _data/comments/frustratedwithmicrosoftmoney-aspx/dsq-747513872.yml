message: <p>MS Money may be frustrating, but I have found Quicken is many times more frustrating. I have tried to switch to Quicken at least 6 times (and have a stack of Quicken boxes to prove it). It's a frankenstein monster of code  from Windows 3.1 to XP, completely stupid non-standard controls, and quirks seem to be the rule rather than the exception. It also has brain dead data manipulation. When I imported my Money data, it classified my credit cards as savings accounts, and you cannot change them to credit accounts. You don't so much use Quicken as try to persuade it into doing what you want.<br><br><br><br>Money has a set of bank access definitions. Those definitions are not updated in your 'bug fix' updates, but rather in entirely new versions of Money. I had the same problem and had to upgrade to the latest version when my bank switched to alphanumeric passwords. Depending on when your bank rules changes, a later version should fix it. The definitions for the site access are very specific, not a free form field as you might expect.<br><br><br><br>If you are willing to try a little guy, however, I'd recommend looking at a product called MoneyDance (<a href="http://moneydance.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://moneydance.com/">http://moneydance.com/</a>) I've tried it a couple times, but I haven't been able to make the jump yet. I may at some point, but it just hasn't made its way up my priority list.<br><br><br><br>Also, you might be interested in reading this blog from a former Money developer. It explains a lot about some of the past iterations of Money:<br><br><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/philipsu/archive/2004/07/01/170682.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blogs.msdn.com/philipsu/archive/2004/07/01/170682.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/philipsu/archive/2004/07/01/170682.aspx</a><br><br></p>
