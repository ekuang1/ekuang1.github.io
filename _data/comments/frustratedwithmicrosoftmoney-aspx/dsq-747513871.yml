Close and reopen Money, and then sign in again online."<br><br><br><br>I do know that they are actually using an (India-)Indian account aggregation company named Yodlee (<a href="http://yodlee.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://yodlee.com">http://yodlee.com</a>) to do the magic account synchronizing. It could be that Yodlee has incorrectly set the maximum length of your FI's password. May want to try a different FI just as a test.<br><br><br><br>Personally I would avoid Intuit products. Their practices as of late have be rather underhanded. You wouldn't believe the setup and subscription fees they charge FI's just to offer their QFX (hacked OFX) exports.</p>
