message: <p>I'd like to add my complaints too towards MS Money.  EXACT same problem as Nathan from 2006.  I recently downloaded &amp; purchased MS Money Deluxe and am having much grief with my passwords (bank wants 11 characters, Money wants only 4-8 and they MUST match).  Where does a person turn?  My advice to anyone thinking about this software - DOWNLOAD TRIAL FIRST don't pay for it until you try it out.  Any knowledge on solution much appreciated!</p>
