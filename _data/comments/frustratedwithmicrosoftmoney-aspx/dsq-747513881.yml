message: <p>I am Using Money 2005.  Occasionally if for gets how to add.  At first I thought that I was making a mistake when balancing an account, but I could not figure it out.  When I balaced an account, the starting balance would match my statement from the previous months closing, I would enter the new closing balance. I proceed to check off all the transaction listed on the staement. The difference between my statement and register comes down to zero.  I press proceed and a window tels me that my starting balance is now wrong, but money filled it in from my previous sucessful balancing.  It only does it occassionally (3 times this year).  It has been off between a penny and ten dollars.  I found a place in the register this last time where there was only 1 transaction that month (an 18 cent dividend) and I took a screen shot of where money could not add the 18 cents and come up with the correct number.</p>
