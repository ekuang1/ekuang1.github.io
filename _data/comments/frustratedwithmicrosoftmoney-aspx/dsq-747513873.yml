message: <p>Thanks Maxx.  It seems that the latest versions of Quicken have been universally reviled, especially given certain underhanded practices Intuit allegedly engages in.  I'll stick with Money.<br><br><br><br>It's too bad that updated bank definitions do not come in product updates.  I shouldn't be forced to upgrade if the product I have meets my needs.</p>
