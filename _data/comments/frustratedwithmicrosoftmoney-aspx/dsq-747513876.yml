message: <p>I'm having the same problem as Nathan Hartley. How did you fix it Jason Knapp? I went into IE (the default for Money) and told it to accept all cookies, but I'm still having this problem.<br>Also, when I click Show Full Category List in Tools:Settings:Categories it tells me  -The standard categories have been added to your list of categories.-  I then click OK and nothing happens. Anyone know how to fix this?<br>Thanks</p>
