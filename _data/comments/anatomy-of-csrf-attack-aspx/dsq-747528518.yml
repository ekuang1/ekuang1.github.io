message: <p>Thanks Phill.<br>Seems to me that we will never be able to protect against such techniques - if the method was crafted enough.<br>I worked for sometime with a Performance Testing (more accurately stress testing) team before in a corporate environment, who were relaying on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoadRunner" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoadRunner">Best Money Can Buy</a> tools to automate such scenarios. And we always found a way to do it.<br>@Travis has a excellent point. All you need is (and sorry for the iteration):<br>1- Get the HTML containing the form<br>2- Parse it, get the token/canary<br>3- Post your evil request<br><em>This can be done using plain old JavaScript</em>. Even with an up-to-date browser, you still can achieve all three requirements.<br>To protect against this advanced JavaScript attack, you can validate the <em>referrer</em> header. But again, using Flex or Silverlight, you might be able to pull it off. (or maybe you're not allowed to change that header?)</p>
