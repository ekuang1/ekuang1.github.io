message: <p>I noticed the line about the browser being trusted in the post, but it's a pretty key thing.<br>For the anonymous commenter, the user may or may not have the expertise to properly choose a secure browser. Just because the user has said browser doesn't make it trusted, and they may or may not have done anything to specifically "make it vulnerable." Person buys a computer that comes with IE 5.5 on it and doesn't know about turning auto-updates on or how to do it manually. Doesn't make IE 5.5 the best or most secure browsing experience.<br>The user may also not have the opportunity to change browsers even if they want to. Some corporate environments have their stuff locked down so even if you know the browser isn't secure, you either use it or you don't browse - no choice.<br>And how many times have security patches come out for one thing that have broken another?<br>Like I said, the anti-forgery token for POST requests is a good 80% solution, but it makes a big assumption that can't be understated. Bold, underlined, and italic - <strong><em><u>it assumes you trust the browser</u></em></strong>.</p>
