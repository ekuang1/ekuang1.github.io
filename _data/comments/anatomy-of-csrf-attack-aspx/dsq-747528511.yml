message: <p>For Banking scenarios your duty is to make a call idempotent too. So "subtract 1000, add 1000" is not the request what should it look like, but "change from 2000 to 1000" describing a bank transfer more...I know it's not about the security perspective of the request but it's connecting :-)</p>
