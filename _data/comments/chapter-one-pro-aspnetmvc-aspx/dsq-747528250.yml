message: <p>The interesting question is, now that you've built it, what happens if people start using it to organize Nerd Dinners? I mean you may have just unintentionally created Frankenstein's Monster...<br>Witht hat said, I really like the idea of Nerd Dinners as a way to network with fellow coders, and hey if you learn some new skills over some bodacious grub then that's groovalicious!</p>
