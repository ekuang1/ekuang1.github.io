message: <p>Difficult chapter to learn MVC from because of the frequent stops to troubleshoot the example code. Example 1; 'Using' statements were coded into Scott's web.config file but this is not noted in the chapter. It is only by reviewing the source code that you 'discover' this (Scott should have started out with a blank web.config file and let VS2008 and his written instructions construct it, just like the reader would). Example 2; Coding terms change during the course of the book. Things like ModelState.AddRuleViolations(dinner.GetRuleViolations()) are later listed as ModelState.AddModelErrors(dinner.GetRuleViolations()) without any explanation. There are other such issues if you actually try to build the site using the chapter instructions. Some of the writing is lazy, especially in the later parts of the chapter. This is not unusual for an author (they get tired of writing the same thing over and over). It also wanders in some places, discussing things that do not pertain to creating the site. However, it is the job of the editor to get this issues corrected/fixed. If this document ever was actually proofed, then shame on the editors. Currently, for me, once authorization was instituted (page 127), create dinner() fails to actually put the dinner into the database. After a week of research and debugging, still not sure why.<br>Seeing all the NerdDinner "help me" postings, and my own frustrations at trying to make this work from what is written, it is understandable why Steve Sanderson's books are more highly recommended. <br>The downloadable code compiles and works just fine (it is quite a bit different than what is given in the chapter). The program itself is very innovative and the MVC structure set up is excellent. Scott and his teams are strong programmers. It is a shame about the amateurish editing, it ruins an otherwise quality product.</p>
