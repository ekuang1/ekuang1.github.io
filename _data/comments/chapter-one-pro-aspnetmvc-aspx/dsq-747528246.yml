message: <p>fear teh awesomeness! In all seriousity, what a completely bitchin idea. It's one of those "why didn't I think of it" things that makes you smack your head and go "yowsers".<br>Anybody here from Montreal or Sacramento, and would like to have a few beers with a mad aussie in the next few weeks? I'm in Montreal for a week starting from Saturday (beware the jetlag!) and Sacramento CA for the following week. Yeah... I should get all official and host a dinner, but I don't know the local area well enough to participate in such madness :-)</p>
