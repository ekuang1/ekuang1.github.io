message: "<p>In fact impedance is very similar to refraction index, the difference being that they are practicaly relevant in completely different frequency domains. An example of mismatch is: you look thru a piece of glass (let's say you are admiring a new notebook in a store) and you see, vaguely, your face. This happens because air and glass have different refractive indexes so part of the light bounces back on the separation surface between air and glass. Exactly the same thing happens to signals when they cross from one type of cable (let's sey 50ohms) to another type of cable (let's say 75 ohms).<br><br><br><br>Using \"impedance mismatch\" for the troubles you get when you try to fit a relational DB with an OO application is merely an analogy (while the two phenomenons presented above are actually the _same_ at a basic level).<br><br><br><br>regards,<br><br> the EE guy<br><br></p>"
