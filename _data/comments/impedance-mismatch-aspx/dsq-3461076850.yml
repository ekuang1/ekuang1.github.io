message: <p>I don't like this usage of "impedance mismatch", to me it makes a simple concept more complicated. Everyone here trying to explain why its appropriate is focusing on the word impedance, but really I think "mismatch" is what the software people really mean. There is a mismatch between the OOP model and the relational model.... stop trying to make things sound more sophisticated than they are...</p>
