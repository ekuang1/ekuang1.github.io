message: <p>I've seen the term "Impedance Mismatch" several times in papers about software or information systems. For instance:<br>"Information systems have traditionally suffered from an <br>impedance mismatch. Their operational environment is <br>understood in terms of actors, responsibilities, objectives, <br>tasks and resources, while the information system itself is <br>conceived as a collection of (software) modules, entities <br>(e.g., objects, agents), data structures and interfaces. This <br>mismatch is one of the main factors for the poor quality of  <br>information systems, also the frequent failure of system <br>development projects." [A Requirements-Driven Development Methodology, J. Castro,2001).<br>Excellent explanation for the software development context. Thank you.</p>
