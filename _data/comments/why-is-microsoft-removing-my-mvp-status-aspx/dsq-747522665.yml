message: <p>Geesh, not another one!<br>Big congratulations Phil. I do hope you keep up the blogging and the excellent work on Subtext. It feels like all the good guys are moving to Seattle, first there was Jonathan (aka Peli), then Bart De Smet, Scott (not sure who was first to move) and now you.<br>But I'll be looking forward to your new blog-posts.<br>Rudi</p>
