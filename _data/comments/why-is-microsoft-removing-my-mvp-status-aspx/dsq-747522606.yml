message: <p>Wow!  Microsoft is absorbing all the "ALT.NET" contingent.  Next will be Scott Bellware (that'll be an accomplishment!)<br>Congrats.  Adding you to the MVC team gives me a bit more hope that it won't suck.  As Ayende has said before, it always seems that MS rebuilds open source and competing products but makes them more complex and harder to use.  Hopefully you can help them keep it simple - we don't need drag and drop!  :)<br></p>
