message: <p>@Adam Me too!<br>@Jon Limjap - Well what I've seen so far is pretty impressive. In fact, I may arrive just in time to take credit for everyone else's hard work. ;)<br>@Scott - Doh! My apologies. I removed the image. It was intended as a joke at my own expense as I'm on the way out and I thought would fall under fair use, but I should have read the license agreement more carefully. I had no intentions of offending.</p>
