message: <p>Congratulations -- being born and raised in the Northwest, I love the weather here (a little variety is a good thing). That said, you'll be arriving during the dark and rainy months that some NW transplants find a bit ... well, depressing. Best of luck.<br>Oh, and Sequim is pronounced "skwim".</p>
