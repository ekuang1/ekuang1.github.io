message: <p>Good for you.  I would also love to work on the MVC framework.  Up to know, I've have a few discussions about the MVC framework, and I've seen the prototype code.  Feel free to ping me with any questions.  This is an area I would definitely like to use my MVP status to give input to Redmond.  I _really_ want Microsoft to do this one well in version 1.0.<br>Congratulations on your move.</p>
