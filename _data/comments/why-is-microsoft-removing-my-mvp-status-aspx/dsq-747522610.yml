message: <p>I wrote up a survival guide to Seattle a while back when Dave Winer announced he was moving up here.<br><a href="http://scottkoon.org/2004/09/13/survival-tips-for-dave-winer-while-in-seattle/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://scottkoon.org/2004/09/13/survival-tips-for-dave-winer-while-in-seattle/">http://scottkoon.org/2004/0...</a><br>The part about the grid <em>is</em> true, but it has unintended consequences. For a while I lived near the corner of 45th NE st. and NE 45 ave. It extends to the eastside too, I once got directions to the corner of 124th NE and NE 124th.</p>
