message: <p>(I'll prefix this by saying it's mid Friday evening here in Aus, I've not used MVC in anger, and I might have had a beer or two :))<br>Call me stupid, but why couldn't you just write an extension method to MapRoute that takes in the collection of routes like your second example, and just does a bit of a spin thru doing like what you did in your first example?<br>Although, on further examination, this directly violates "Note that the child routes are not themselves added to the route table and they have no idea what parent path theyâ€™ll end up responding to", so I'm probably talking out my backside here. Carry on. Have a beer for this tired Aussie :)</p>
