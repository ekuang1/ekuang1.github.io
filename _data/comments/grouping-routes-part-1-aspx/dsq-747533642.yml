message: "<p>@Dan F:  He could have done, but that would have meant that a request for ~/something_else would have to check against ~/blog/posts, ~/blog/posts/{id}, ~/blog/archives and so on.  He was trying to group all those three ~/blog/* routes under ~/blog, so that a request for ~/something_else just checks once, against the group, and moves on.<br>It's over-engineering in this case since 3 routes probably wouldn't cause an issue.  For a larger site, something like this may be significant.<br>However, like he says this is voodoo magic because you're not really supposed to play with the stuff he's playing with.  Still, fun and interesting nonetheless.</p>"
