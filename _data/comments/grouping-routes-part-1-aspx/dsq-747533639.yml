message: <p>The "AppRelativeCurrentExecutionFilePath" is exactly the same headache we have in the MvcSiteMapProvider. We fixed it similarly, by creating a wrapper around HttpContextBase and rewriting the URL in an overloaded property.<br>This makes two of us running against that wall, so maybe a small update in the route system can be handy :-p</p>
