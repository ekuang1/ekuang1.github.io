message: <p>I've an issue that looks like your post may elude to. Say you create a second GroupRoute like "~/forum" that adds the BlogRoutes Collection. Is that possible? if a user hits <a href="http://website.com/r1" rel="nofollow noopener" title="website.com/r1">website.com/r1</a>, how would you send them to the right page? Could you include the GroupRoute as a filter? Am I way off here? I'm way off aren't I?</p>
