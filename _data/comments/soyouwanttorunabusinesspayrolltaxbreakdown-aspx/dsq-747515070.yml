message: "<p>A month ago some Belgian magazine pointed out that Belgium is the #1 country in the world to pay additional taxes on employee wages payed for the employer. The average ratio is 51%, that means that it costs an employer 151 usd to give the employee a 100 usd (bruto) raise.<br>On top of that the employee's paycheck is taxed at an average of 46%. This means the employee is left with 64 usd.<br>Sigh, sometimes I wish I lived in the US ;).<br></p>"
