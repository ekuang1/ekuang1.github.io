message: <p>Hi Phil just find that the change <strong>was made</strong> in MVC 2 RC 2 default project template.I found that when I was playing with item templates and project templates in VS 2008 and VS 2010 and wanted to copy the templates to the VS 2010 regarding folder to work with the updated version of MVC 2 RC 2 in VS 2010 RC.</p>
