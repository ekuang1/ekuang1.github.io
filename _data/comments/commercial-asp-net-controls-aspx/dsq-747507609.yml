message: <p>I've used some.  If you have any desire for clean html and cross-browser compatibility stay away from Infragistics.  Their WinForms controls are great, but the ASP.NET ones are less desirable.<br><br><br><br>Best commercial component I've used is dotNetCharting's chart control.  Easy to use and looks good.</p>
