message: <p>Simone,<br>I'm still not clear on exactly what CoComment is trying to accomplish either. I've read the "What is CoComment" stuff over at <a href="http://cocomment.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://cocomment.com/">CoComment.com</a> but it is not exactly obvious [to me at least] what all this hype is about.<br>Anyone have a link to <u>CoComment for Dummies</u>?</p>
