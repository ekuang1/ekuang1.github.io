message: <p>Just to expand a little on what Phil had to say, in addition to being able to subscribe to an RSS feed of your conversations, there are 2 other ways to track them as well, for example my CoComment comments page is <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/comments/jaypatrick" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cocomment.com/comments/jaypatrick">here</a>, and they also have a small peice of html you can use on your own site to embed your cocomments, once again you can see mine &lt;a href="<a href="http://jaysonknight.com/conversations/default.aspx>here" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://jaysonknight.com/conversations/default.aspx>here">http://jaysonknight.com/con...</a>.<br>I agree with Phil that there is probably a better way to do this, but coco is still in early beta stages so hopefully they'll get it cleaned up a bit. The other obstacle they face is that to make it useful, lots of people have to sign up for it, and the blog owners have to implement coco on their sites.  It'll be interesting to see where this goes. The good news is that coco is backed by Swiss Telecom (the largest telecommunication company in Switzerland), so it's probably not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
