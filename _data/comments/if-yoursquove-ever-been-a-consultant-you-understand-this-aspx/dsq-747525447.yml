message: <p>I've rarely had this problem, although I see it talked about quite a bit on freelancing sites. What's my secret?<br>- My terms are NET 10 days not 30.<br>- No matter what size organization I am dealing with, I always make sure they understand that I will need payment in a timely fashion, or work on their project will be suspended. <br>- In most cases, I ask for some portion of the payment up front (perhaps 10%). The rest of the project is broken down into modules with appropriate payment milestones that are equivalent to approximately 2 weeks of work.<br>- If I haven't received payment in 2 weeks, I follow-up with the client to determine what is happening. (Sometimes I remind the customer that this is my paycheck, and ask how they would react if their paycheck was late.)<br>- If I haven't received payment in 3-4 weeks, I stop work until payment has been received. Then when the money is received, I add them back into my schedule. However, slow payers no longer get priority.<br>There is no reason why organizations can't pay consultants in a timely fashion.  <br></p>
