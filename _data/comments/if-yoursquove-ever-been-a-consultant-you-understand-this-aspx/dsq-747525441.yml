message: <p>An EU study concluded that 25% of insolvencies are due to clients paying far past the invoice due dates. That is why the EU implemented a directive that allows one to fine companies for outstanding debts (&gt; 31 days). <br>These fines are rather large (7% + refinancing rate = ~11%). No reminders necessary :)<br>If you are EU based and invoice to companies; Implement this and you'll see a sharp decline in invoices &gt; 30 old. <br>Some background info on <a href="http://www.afera.com/files_content/latepaymentsarticle.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.afera.com/files_content/latepaymentsarticle.pdf">www.afera.com/.../latepaymentsarticle.pdf</a></p>
