message: <p>Well, I have had this kind of problem too. I think we have to keep a way to get the money because the customers are always the same, they want to take adventage. In my last project, the customer stops paying, but I continued working. I thouthg that he would pay when the project finishes, but he never gave a intention to pay. Well, I decided to installed the system, but don't given him the source code (He was very interested in the source code). Well that was my key, I went there and I told him. The project it's finish here is the installation cd, etc. Then he asked me if the CD included the source code. That was my opportunity, I told him, well you haven't paid for that, but the system it's ready to use. We will finish in this moment with the project, you can use it. The source code is mine, if you want to buy it later, we will talk again about the price. <br>Well, the customer began to try to asked me for a payment plan. I told him that I have waited for long time and if he wanted the source he had to pay on that moment. He was a little angry at the first time, but he saw I was tolking seriously.<br>He gave the rest of the money on that moment!!.<br>keep a key!<br><br></p>
