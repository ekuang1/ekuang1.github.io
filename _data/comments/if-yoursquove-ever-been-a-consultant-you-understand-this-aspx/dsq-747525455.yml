message: <p>Of course you would never, ever, install a timebomb that would cause the software to stop working after, say, 35 days on a NET30.<br>Nothing serious, just something that causes critical functionality to stop working, something that could be easily deactivated if the bill is paid, usually in the form of a .01 version upgrade to "get rid of a few bugs". A really good one removes traces of itself and continues working even if the client restores their backups.<br>Only the evil Dogbet would do that.</p>
