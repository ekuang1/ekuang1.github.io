message: <p>Ah, the fun of it all. I harken back to one of my freelance jobs as a trainer for a smallish "Technical Skills School". Things started getting late and later and later still. <br>I had a quick sit-down right before my class with the operations manager. It was mid-semester. <br>I said -- "you owe me 4K that is way over 120 days past due, I have sent countless reminders, made countless phone calls, and all I get is the runaround. What is going on?". <br>He said -- "oh that... well, the ownership of the company has actually changed hands... although we still have the same name, you will have to contact the previous owner... but WE still want you to teach". <br>To which I replied -- "I need a check today, after class, or I cannot teach anymore". <br>To which he said -- "there is no way we can do that because WE don't owe you the money but we will pay future invoices and you MUST finish the semester or we will sue you". <br>To which I said -- "goodbye" with a smile and walked out then and there. I never got the money; but, I never heard from them.<br>That company went out of business (and they were national) about 1 year later. No wonder.<br>100% true story.<br>My phone service provider never once accepted the explanation "I am waiting on a check in the mail" as an excuse for not paying them.<br>That's the only time in 10+ years that that has happened-- but, there comes a time when one has to draw the line.<br>HTH someone.<br>Thank you.<br>-- Mark Kamoski<br></p>
