message: <p>Hi all!, I was trying to use this tip, but It doesn't seem to work in IE6... could someone please confirm this?<br>I can see that the <a> tag is correctly positioned and sized through DebugBar, but the region isn't clickable. The text inside </a><a> is clickable though.<br>Thanks to all</a></p>
