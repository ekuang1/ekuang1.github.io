message: "<p>I think I've found an interesting solution that I haven't read about yet. I'm using a wordpress blog and didn't want to actually put an image tag in the .php files because I want the css document to do absolutely all the work when it comes to styling. Alistapart wrote an article indicating that display:none renders the title invisible to screen-readers. Hence, my search for another solution:<br>here's the code for the header:<br><code><br>&lt;div id=\"header\"&gt;<br>&lt;h1&gt;<a href=\"<?php echo get_settings('home'); ?>/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"<?php echo get_settings('home'); ?>/\">&lt;?php bloginfo('name'); ?&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>&lt;?php bloginfo('description'); ?&gt;</a>&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end div header --&gt;  <br></code><br><em>the above code displays the blog title and blog description, depending on what the user inputs.</em><br>in the stylesheet I coded the header div and the h1 a combo (though reasonably, I could have probably left the h1 tags out, but I wanted the importance of the header to remain paramount. My understanding is that h1 tags also indicate importance within the markup. <br><code><br>#header {<br>background: url(images/title.jpg) no-repeat;<br>border: 2px solid blue;<br>height: 75px;<br>width: 509px;}<br><br>#header h1 a {<br>height: 75px;<br>        width: 509px;<br>opacity: 0.01;<br>position: absolute;<br>text-align: center;}<br></code><br>Interestingly, the inclusion of the 'position' tag seemed to ensure that the boundaries of the background image were entirely clickable. Before that inclusion, the text was clickable, but the empty space around it was not, no matter what size it got to. It doesn't matter what font size the text is, since the space is clickable, but it's invisible because of opacity. What I'm not sure about is how much opacity is supported in older browsers. I suspect it's unlikely. I tried to combine text-indent with negative margins with this solution, but it seems to conflict with text-align and the position. Your Mileage May Vary. <br>-Ruby</p>"
