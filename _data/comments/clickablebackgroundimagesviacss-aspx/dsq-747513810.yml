message: '<p>Article is misleading! Anyone with basic knowledge can wrap href tags around some text in a div. Pretty easy. <br>How about using a xhtml div element with a seperately coded css background image and making that image clickable/linkable?? Probably a job for javascript, eh?<br>ps: "display: none;" does not work, it just hides the text and makes it unselectable.</p>'
