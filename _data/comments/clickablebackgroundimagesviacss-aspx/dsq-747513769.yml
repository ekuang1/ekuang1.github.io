message: <p>That's a fair question.  It's not necessarily better. It depends on the context.<br><br><br><br>My example oversimplifies the real situation.  Normally, it would probably be better to have the logo as a real img tag.  That would be semantically correct.<br><br><br><br>In the real situation, we had a fixed width design and the html I received had the header graphic (which contained the logo on the left, and a big swoosh type thing in the background that extended all the way to the right) as one graphic extending the entire width.  <br><br><br><br>However on the right side of the header were some links and other dynamic content.<br><br><br><br>In this situation, had we known in advance that the logo was clickable, we would have cut this up in a certain way.  But to save time (and money), we just slapped it as a background image (so that we could have dynamic content over it).<br><br><br><br>Then later, after it was in production, we found out the logo had to be clickable.  When changing production, I like to do as little as possible.  So rather than recut the graphic and modify the html AND css, we just had to modify the html slightly and the css, no recutting graphics.</p>
