message: <p>The Clickable Background images using CSS works great. But i am not able to Save the Image using right click. When i right click the image, the save option is not visible. I know that including a background image in the css blocks us from saving the image using right click, but i want to find if there is a setting which i can use in the css which enables this option for me.</p>
