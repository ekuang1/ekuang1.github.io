message: <p>Robb, I was just being vain. I couldn't stand you getting any more attention so I just decided to link to myself. ;)<br><br><br><br>Actually, I think this is a problem with Firefox and the clipboard. Sometimes when I copy the URL in Firefox into the clipboard, it doesn't work. So I must not have paid attention when I pasted what was already in the clipboard.</p>
