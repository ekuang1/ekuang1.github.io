message: <p>Phil, this is brilliant!! I was just a few weeks ago asking my hosting provider for a better alternative than ftp upload triggered from local machine. <br>Would this work in Medium++ trust? Either way I'd love to see the source code for this. The MvcScaffolding project that Sanderson just blogged about opened my eyes to NuGet, haven't really used it before.</p>
