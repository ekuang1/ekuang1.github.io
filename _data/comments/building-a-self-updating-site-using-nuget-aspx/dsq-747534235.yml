message: <p>It's quite useful to have such easy process. Thanks for sharing the idea and actually doing it.<br>I was thinking, if we had a way to do this autoupdates in a partial manner that would me more useful. You can see here and there some of the features of a new version maybe in conflict with someone's way of arranging things. Does that mean we should have a package manager inside the package manager? Maybe the original package should be maintaiend very carefully.<br>Thanks pal anyway.</p>
