message: <p>Phil, this looks great. It would good to extend this concept further to create a way of deploying and maintaining features/plugins within an application. There are so many OSS projects that would benefit from a standardised way of doing this.<br>Orchard already has something like this - are they using Nuget.Core too?</p>
