message: "<p>If I remember my Korean correctly, Hangul requires consonant-vowel combinations, and what you wrote was the equivalent of writing some English consonant combinations which don't make sense on their own (like if you saw \"tqk\" on its own).<br>Wikipedia seems to support this, if that matters at all:<br>Syllabic blocks<br>Except for a few grammatical morphemes in archaic texts, no letter may stand alone to represent elements of the Korean language. Instead, jamo are grouped into syllabic blocks of at least two and often three: (1) a consonant or consonant cluster called the initial (초성, 初聲 choseong syllable onset), (2) a vowel or diphthong called the medial (중성, 中聲 jungseong syllable nucleus), and, optionally, (3) a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the final (종성, 終聲 jongseong syllable coda). <br>A more correct phoneticization of \"hacked\" which makes more sense in Korean (IMO) is 하쿹</p>"
