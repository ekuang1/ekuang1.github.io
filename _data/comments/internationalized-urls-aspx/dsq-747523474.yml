message: <p>What about phoneticizing the word? You mention above that 하ㅋㄷ has a phonetic equivalent which can be expressed in ASCII-range characters. I believe that most (all?) east-Asian languages have a fairly standard glyph/ideogram-to-phonetic-spelling mapping that could be applied. This would probably be more useful than a big nasty urlencoded string.</p>
