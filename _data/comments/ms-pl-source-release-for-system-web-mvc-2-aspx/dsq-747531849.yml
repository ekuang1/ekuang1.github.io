message: <p>This is great but we need a bit more clarification, let me explain.<br>What happens when the project I work under releases under a different license eg Apache License, Version 2.0.<br>I'm asking because according to the Conditions and Limitations of MS-PL, specifically this one "(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license."<br>This to me (I'm not a lawyer) states that the license I use to release my software under needs to comply with MS-PL, right?<br>So, the problem I'm facing is that I'm finding it very hard to find out what licenses comply with MS-PL, eg does ASFL(<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html</a>) complies with MS-PL?<br>Cheers<br>John<br></p>
