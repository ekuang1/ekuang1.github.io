message: <p>@John unfortunately, I'm not a lawyer so I can't provide legal advice.<br>It seems to me that you could simply have multiple licenses. Ms-PL for the Ms-PL portion of the code and Apache for the rest of it. Again, I'm not a lawyer so don't take this as advice. I'll pose the question on twitter to see if anyone responds.<br></p>
