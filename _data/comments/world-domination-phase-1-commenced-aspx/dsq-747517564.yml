message: <p>Good job Phil. <br>The mind-control game began upon conception. Phil, you'll notice that your thoughts are already on him/her, and will rarely ever come back for long periods of time. A physical device is rarely necessary for the parents. <br>Geeks need to make more babies! Join the club.</p>
