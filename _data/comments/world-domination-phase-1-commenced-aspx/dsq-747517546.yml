message: <p>Congrats Phil &amp; Akumi! I hear that the training for milestone 1 can get quite dirty, so Godspeed.<br>Have you thought about names yet? <br>For a boy, I think that Phillip Haack <strong>2.0</strong> has a certain ring to it. Unless of course you consider yourself to be a beta release, in which case a boy would be Phil <strong>1.0</strong>.</p>
