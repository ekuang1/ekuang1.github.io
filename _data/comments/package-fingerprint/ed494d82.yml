  I was just tweeting about Trusted Builds the other day (https://twitter.com/aelij/status/1127495832205393920).





  I believe this to be the best solution, and it's definitely doable. The pipeline could use a verified build that has certain limitations, e.g.:

  * No internet access except for verified feeds



  * Runs in a container on Microsoft-hosted machines

  * Mandatory malware scanning





  Only if these conditions are met, the package will be published as "verified" to the feed. Since the GitHub Package Repository and Azure Pipelines are both Microsoft-owned, forming this trust between them should be possible.
