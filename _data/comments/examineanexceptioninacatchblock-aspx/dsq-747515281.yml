message: <p>Thanks for this.  I have been wondering how to suppress the warnings about unreferenced variables, never thinking that the C# Reference and all the books I've looked at would neglect to mention that the variable name in a specific exception catch clause is optional.  It takes a visit to the language specification document to find this out.</p>
