message: "<p>It looks like if you're using a custom filter, ( : ActionFilterAttribute), to compress your html generated by a view, writing to the response output in an end request event doesn't work.  If I learn enough about MVC to understand why, I'll post back, or maybe someone knows.  I posted this on Stackoverflow too. (I know Phil Haack knows:))</p>"
