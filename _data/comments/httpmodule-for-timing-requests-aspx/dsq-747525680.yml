message: <p>Hi<br>The code is great, exactly what I needed however, outputting to the screen is fine, but I want then take the result and pass it to the server as a variable, but I can't read the value, how do I access it?<br>I also tried using httpcontextsession to set the value to a variable and then access that variable, but the session is always null<br>Can anyone advise please?  Thanks<br>Deirdre</p>
