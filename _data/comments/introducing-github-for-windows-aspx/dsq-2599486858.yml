message: "<p>One thing I don't like about it, is the way it installed itself in %APPDATA% (together with git.exe is set in %APPDATA% as well (why not Program Files as other legitimate software?) Recently, in an attempt to prevent CryptoLocker and other ransomware in the wild, the sysadmin enforced a new Group Policy Object with a rule to block any binary file to run from %APPDATA%. That caused a lot of problem (even the way GitHub install as a OneClick application should be frown upon: it doesn't leaving any configuration to user).</p>"
