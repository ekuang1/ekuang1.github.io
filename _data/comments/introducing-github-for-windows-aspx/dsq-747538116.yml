message: <p>Hello, <br>Has anyone tried running PowerShell ISE as a default shell for github? PowerShell works just fine but I really want the tabs of the ISE, and the more advanced options. However when I set the path in GitHub to custom C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell_ise.exe the PS ISE won't load my Profile. The Execution Policy is set to Undefined and I get errors when trying to modify it because it runs without Admin Privileges.<br>Any suggestions for this? Can I set-up GitHub to start the PS ISE in admin mode?<br>Thanks</p>
