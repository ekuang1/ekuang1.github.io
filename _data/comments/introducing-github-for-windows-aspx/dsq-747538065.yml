message: <p>Played with it some more and this is just really slick and cool.<br>After playing with it for a while I am now even more convinced that multiple remotes is probably the most needed next feature. In particular, it seems that one of the most common workflows probably can't be done right. Here is what I have in mind:<br>1. Surf to some cool open source project on github<br>2. Want to try it, so click "Clone in Windows"<br>3. Play with it locally. Find something where I can improve things and do it<br>And now I am probably stuck because I can't get this out of my local repo from within gh4w, right? I would have needed to first fork on gh, then clone my fork. But when I cloned I didn't really want to create a fork because I never planned to contribute anything, that only came later.<br>Actually, gh4w actually even tries to publish my changes back to the read only public repo and then tells me that there was an error. Really there shouldn't even be a button "publish" if the remote is access via the git protocol.<br>Alright, you guys are probably working on that already in any case ;)</p>
