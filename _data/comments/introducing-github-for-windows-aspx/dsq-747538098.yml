message: <p>Is it possible to add a context menu entry to folders, so I can open the git powershell from every folder in windows and be in the correct directory already? I tried to do it myself, but I could not figure out whether "GitHub.exe --open-shell" had a parameter I could simply set to select the desired folder. Would be great if this was possible.</p>
