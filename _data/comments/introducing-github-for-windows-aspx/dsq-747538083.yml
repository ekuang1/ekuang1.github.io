message: <p>Haacked - Is there any chance GH4W could simplify migration from BitBucket to GitHub? I recently had to migrate a project and I must say the experience was less than ideal. I have <a href="http://www.mehdi-khalili.com/migrating-from-mercurial-to-git" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.mehdi-khalili.com/migrating-from-mercurial-to-git">blogged</a> about the glitches I had and how I overcame them; but I think this could be made SO much simpler and I cannot think of a better candidate than GH4W.</p>
