message: <p>I agree with James Manning. They even state quite clearly that this is going to have a background update feature like Chrome, and update itself over time. They could have waited to add a lot more features before release, but why? Better to let it out into the wild and get feedback from real users, IMHO.<br>It's a starting point. And, personally, I like it a lot. I'm certainly not ready to switch from Tortoise Git to this full-time, but over time, as more features are included, this could very well become my client of choice. We'll see where this evolves to over time. Great work!</p>
