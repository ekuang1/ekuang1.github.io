message: "<p>This app gets off on the wrong foot, as it's just not obvious for a newbie what to do with it. I mean, after installation it offers one solitary option, unless I'm missing something: \"create a repository.\" As a newb to Git I wonder: what does this mean? I know what I want to do: I want to fork or clone an existing project. Is that what \"create a repository\" does?? I'm not sure whether I should fork it or clone it (the maybe the app should help me decide), but if I click \"create a repository\" I am taken to the \"new repository\" page which asks for a name and a description... hmm... this really doesn't look like I'm connecting to an existing project.<br>After seeing this I gave up on GitHub for a month and wondered if I should just break down and figure out how to use git command-line. I had no idea that one must use a web browser to Fork or Clone on <a href=\"http://github.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"github.com\">github.com</a> first, and then return to the Git App and click one's username to see the fork or clone listed.</p>"
