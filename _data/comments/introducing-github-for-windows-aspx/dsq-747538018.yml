message: <p>Borek, I tend to agree with you. The most difficult part of Git for Windows users is all the Unix type configuration, ie installing the right bits in a language they know, creating SSH keys etc. Wrap this in a nice interface and all is good. Actually using the Bash command line and Git Extensions is then very easy.</p>
