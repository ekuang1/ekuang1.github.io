message: <p>Hi.<br>I suppose it should be mentioned that if you're getting an error like this<br><code>An error occurred trying to download '<a href="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHub.application'" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHub.application'">github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com</a>.</code><br>and error log ends with something like this<br><code>Launching Application.<br>URLDownloadToCacheFile failed with HRESULT '-2146697208'<br>An error occurred trying to download '<a href="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHub.application'" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHub.application'">github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com</a>.</code><br>and everything is fine with your internet connection,<br>then you can try opening <a href="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHub.application" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHub.application">github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHub.application</a> directly in internet explorer and then it should work fine.</p>
