message: <p>Hmm, I wonder if I got so confused because the "Clone in Windows" command on my home computer doesn't work. When I clicked "Clone in Windows", I am prompted to download GitHub for Windows, although it is already installed. This gives the impression that cloning is a task that must be done within the GitHub app, even though the GitHub app doesn't have a UI for cloning.<br>At first I got the impression that it just didn't work in Firefox because I got it to work in IE... now I suspect the problem was that I was not signed in to GitHub on Firefox. Either way GitHub doesn't exactly guide one to the 'pit of success'.</p>
