message: <p>Good to have another Windows Git tool, but unlike claims in the article and comments, I never had a problem installing Git on Windows before this!<br>msysgit was not hard to install and connect to GitHub etc, it is just that it requires knowing a few Unix commands and using Git on a command line. There was bit of config (.gitignore for instance), but not hard for a developer (which I'm assuming most people using Git on Windows are).<br>Git Extensions was even easier and more fully featured. It uses a Windows installer (no more difficult than installing MS Office or anti-virus software for instance), and there are options to install SSH client (PuTTY or OpenSSH) diff tools (KDiff3), Visual Studio plug-in and so forth. By default you also get a sensible .gitignore configuration for Visual Studio.<br>Since the Git Extensions installer also installs an SSH client, then you can connect easily to an remote repository. (The lack of an SSH client being included with Windows is a stumbling block for other Git GUI software on Windows, as Linux and OS X have SSH included so no need to install).</p>
