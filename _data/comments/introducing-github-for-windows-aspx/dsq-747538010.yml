message: <p>I've seen just positive responses all over the place so let me add a view from another side.<br>I've tried gh4w for about 5 minutes and simply can't imagine this being my Git client of choice. Or, being my Git client at all.<br>The UX is pretty rough around the edges at the moment (e.g., I wanted to add an existing local repository to the list of repositories so I clicked "Add", this to my surprise displayed the create new repository form with the first item, repo name, already marked as invalid even before I had a chance to do anything; I could name a few other things just after the first 2 minutes with the app, it certainly didn't leave a good impression). Also, there is just very basic functionality there which might be OK for the first release but even that basic functionality is quite hard to use, for instance, on the commit screen it's very hard to view what actually changed in the files. Larger diffs are not fun to go through, there is no way to launch a 3rd party diff tool (is it?) etc.<br>I kind of understand why this app was created but if you claim that this app is "The easiest way to use Git on Windows. Period."  I have to strongly disagree. What might be slightly hard or confusing for newcomers is the original configuration of Git and gh4w does a good job of installing all the prerequisites but beyond that it is inferior to other Git clients in almost every way I can think of (features, usability, fit and finish etc. - the Metrotwit style might look fancy but I don't think it actually helps to do the job).<br>I think that of greater value would be some kind of installer that would install MSysGit, posh-git, TortoiseGit, create SSH key, upload it to GitHub, do some initial configuration locally and then just display a big message "now use your Explorer and TortoiseGit in it (or install Git client of your choice)".<br>I appreciate your attempt on a usable Git client for Windows but I don't think this one is it.</p>
