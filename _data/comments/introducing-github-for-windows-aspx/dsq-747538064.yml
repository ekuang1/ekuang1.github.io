message: <p>Well I just want to say that after playing around with this for a while it does the job that it clams to do. Its a simple windows installer that lets someone get msysgit and other tools installed and working. <br>It took a few plays to figure out how to get a local repo to connect to github and sync. But all in all it was pretty easy. Some people have a hard time getting it all setup for me it was just time consuming the first time. <br>I like the fact that it don't mess with any settings that you have for smartgit or msysgit that we my all ready have setup as I have both of them already.<br>@Borek thats great that you don't like and think it should be done different now go a head and do it make your wonderful installer to do exactly what you want I am sure many of us will be happy to try it out. Until then this is a decent low learning curve setup. and you don't like the GUI use the shell with whatever shell you prefer.</p>
