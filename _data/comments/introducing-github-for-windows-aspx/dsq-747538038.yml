message: "<p>@Timur yes. You'll need to use the Git Shell to clone it locally following the instructions from the other hosting provider. Then drag the local repository into the application.<br>@Craig: Sync does a <code>git pull --rebase</code> and then a <code>git push</code> if you have any local commits.<br>@Terry no idea about the perf differences between Windows and Unix. I haven't had any problems. GH4W does sit on top of msysgit and libgit2.<br>@Erik: I'm not sure about CAS support. Probably something we'll want to look into.<br>@Rob, @James, @Daniel, @Patrik: at the moment, it is not open source. Many of the libraries we created are open source. As we polish up more and more of those libraries, we'll release more components we used to make the app.<br>@Borek thanks for the feedback. We actually do install msysgit and posh-git and such. So if you don't like the UI, you can simply take advantage of the pre-configured shell we install.<br>@Marc yeah, we've run into some of these issues. We'd like to try and work with the Git and MSysGit team to supply patches.<br>@flukus not at the moment<br>@davidacoder supporting multiple remotes is something we'd like to do. We wanted the first release to be simple and support the mainline scenarios. We didn't want to rush support for multiple remotes. If we implement that, we want to make sure the UI is elegant and approachable.<br>@Otto: no relation to GitExtensions.<br>@Artiom: At the moment, we don't have good support for submodules. We plan to improve that over time.<br>@Version control noob: Try this <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/ch1-3.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://git-scm.com/book/ch1-3.html\">http://git-scm.com/book/ch1-3.html</a></p>"
