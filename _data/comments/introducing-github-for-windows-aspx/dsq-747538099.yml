message: <p>This looks like it should be an awesome tool.  But right now I'm experiencing an ENORMOUS anti-climax.<br>I had a fiddle around with GH4W today and, surely, I must be missing something... I can't find a "windows" way to add and commit files to a local repository?<br>GH4W is is a beautiful metro-style app, effortlessly making use of drag-n-drop for repositories - surely I should be able to drag-n-drop files too - rather than having to resort to laughably archaic command line operations, shouldn't I?<br>Please tell me I'm missing something!  If not, is the source available, as it would be a ridiculously quick operation to graft file-add/commit to it?</p>
