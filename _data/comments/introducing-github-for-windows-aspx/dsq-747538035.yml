message: <p>I heard about this from the Hanselman Podcast and was excited. I've been wanting to use Version Control for my own projects, and tried git a while ago but found it incompletely intimidating. I was hoping this was the answer I was looking for. But it seems like I still need an understanding of "plain ole git" to get started. I need a "GitHub for Windows for the Absolute beginner" set of instructions. Does something like this exist?<br>Thanks</p>
