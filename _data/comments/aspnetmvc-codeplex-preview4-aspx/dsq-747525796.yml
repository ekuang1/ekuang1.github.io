message: <p>Phil, I love the new MVC framework.<br>For Validation it would be nice if you could keep existing the existing technique used in Dynamic Data by having a metadata class or being able to use the metadata class if available. I think I saw or heard you guys were already thinking this way. I would love to see what this might look like as soon as possible.<br>Thanks!</p>
