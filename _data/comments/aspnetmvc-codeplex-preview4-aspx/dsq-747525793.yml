message: <p>Could you image what WebForms would be like if a similar approach was taken like this one for MVC?<br>I love getting the bits and getting to play around with them early. I also appreciate the fact that your team is so open to suggestions and feedback. It has really been great to see some of our feedback getting put in and considered.<br>I think that we all realize some hard decisions are going to have to be made for RTM (what's in, what's out, what goes to Futures, etc...) but I think that we have a real good opportunity with leveraging the MvcContrib project. With the bits made available to us there is nothing stopping us from writing our own jQuery "providers" etc...<br>In short... keep up the great work</p>
