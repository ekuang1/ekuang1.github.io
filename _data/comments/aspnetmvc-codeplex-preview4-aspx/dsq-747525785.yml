message: <p>"For those that have used this, you’ll notice that we removed the ComponentController class. Instead, we renamed RenderComponent to be RenderAction and re-implemented it so that it works against a normal controller. This code is was moved to the MVC Futures assembly since we’re not planning to include it in the RTM."<br>Can you explain this further and also explain the alternative, because I thought this was exactly what was needed and don't understand why it's bad.</p>
