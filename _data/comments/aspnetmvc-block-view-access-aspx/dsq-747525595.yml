message: <p>My thinking may be a little backwards wrt ASP.NET MVC (I still use monorail), but isn't the views directory really a directory of templates through which the views are rendered and therefore shouldn't containing anything but templates?<br>IMHO use a content directory to separate stuff that the browser will request directly from the stuff that the browser will receive indirectly (the views).</p>
