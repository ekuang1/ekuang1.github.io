message: '<p>Salmon &gt; 2lbs per week = mercury poisoning = personality changes, nervousness, trembling, and dementia.<br><br><br><br>NOTE (<a href="http://www.sfms.org/sfm/sfm301d.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.sfms.org/sfm/sfm301d.htm">http://www.sfms.org/sfm/sfm301d.htm</a>): <br><br>To give an example, salmon has a mercury level on average of 0.035 mcg/g. A 60 Kg person could eat 42 mcg Hg/ week and stay within the current EPA guidelines. This would be about 2 lbs per week of salmon. For swordfish at 1 mcg/g this would be less than 2 ounces per week. For canned tuna at 0.206 mcg/g, a child should not eat more than 1 ounce per 20 lbs. body wt./week. Although the recent warning did not include large tuna, many researchers and advocates, including myself, feel that it should have. Canned tuna is also still being questioned as people eat so much of it.</p>'
