message: <p>I'm with you there. I'm awful when it comes to the "finger crossing" methodology sometimes. However in my defense, I'm known for my forensic abilities and I learn better watching things break.<br><br><br><br>But I'm frustated in my current job role because I've been handed production applications written by some very, very, very poor developers. &lt;b&gt;ONE&lt;/b&gt; class I am dealing with is 28 pages printed. And since it's production, I'm not given the time I need to accurately fix things. It's nothing but popsicle sticks, duct tape, and chewing gum for me.<br><br><br><br>My main task is fixing the speed issues because our users refuse to use the application and the current system (Oracle Portal) has reached the end of it's supported life and needs to be shut down. But I'm not allowed to rearchitect the solution, I just have to find better uses of the chewing gum. Did I mention that the HTML data sent to the client is 756k to 1M? And that 80% of the fields require a postback?<br><br><br><br>So, I don't want to be intellectually lazy, but I'm dealing with code written by a group who was. And you can't fight illogic with logic.<br><br><br><br>Sigh... Sorry for the carping and bitching, but I'm feeling the pain of what you're talking about.</p>
