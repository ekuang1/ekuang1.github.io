message: <p>Congrats, Phil!  I think it's a wise choice, and they're lucky to have you!  SF is great, but expensive as heck (!), so you're probably getting the best of both worlds by living in SEA. :)  Give me a call one of these times when you're coming into the bay area!  I'm in SF fairly frequently now that I'm working at Bizo (which is going great by the way), so I'd love to meet up for a couple beers and catch up, or we can meet half-way for a Sushirito!  (Yes, that's a sushi burrito - only in SF...)  Take care!</p>
