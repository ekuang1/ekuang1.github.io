message: <p>I wish you all success at GitHub. I've been using Git since way before GitHub, and always on a Windows box, and I've pored over the code of many of the C# Git implementations. I've always hoped that Git would catch more C# interest, and I think that your mastery of C# and MVC should only lead to something good!</p>
