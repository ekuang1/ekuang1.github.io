message: <p>Congratulations and good luck! Like some of the other commenters, I have found Git too complicated and "hacky" to use. I still prefer SVN, but have used Mercurial on several projects and liked it. I would definitely choose HG over Git for distributed source control. Not sure how much you can do about that, since your job description probably doesn't include fundamentally changing the way Git works; but it would be fun to watch you try :)</p>
