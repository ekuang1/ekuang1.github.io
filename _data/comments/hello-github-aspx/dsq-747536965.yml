message: <p>I'm a fan of Microsoft having cut most of my professional teeth on VB/VC/.NET but as a Ruby, Rails and Github (@databyte) lover for 4 years now, you're on the right side of the fence to make changes. I know many .NET devs have embraced MVC, hand-coded Javascript, and  full-fledged integrated libraries using Nuget. The question is if they'll then fork existing libraries, make it better and facilitate the pull requests back up.<br>There is a percentage of devs who have embraced Powershell, can deploy code without a mouse, or love the idea of social coding. I'll be interested in seeing how you and Github consume the larger percentage of users that prefer GUIs, VS plugins, and rarely follow the musings of yourself and Scott Hanselman.<br>(My guess was StackExchange or Github, I think you're in a place to make a greater impact.)</p>
