message: <p>Cool deal and congrats! Although I will miss your contributions to MVC project, you're moving into another interesting area. I like to use GitHub with my C# projects already, but am even more encouraged to keep using it now.<br>Could you please write a nice post on proper use of line-ending settings in git for Windows projects. I've found this to be a source of frustration for beginning users.<br>Cheers!</p>
