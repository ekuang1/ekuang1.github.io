message: <p>At first I was baffled why you left Microsoft, you we're working on one of the best projectos to come out of redmond in years. But now I get it, and I'm glad for you.<br>I'm primarily .net developer and I've been using github for a couple of years now but it has always had better integration with MAC/*nix/Linux/etc than with windows.<br>I use github for all of my Android projects but I usually work on those from my macbook pro using Lion OS X or Ubuntu. <br>For all of my .net development I usually go with SVN/TFS because of the thight integration with Visual Studio. I hope your stay at github will make things better for us .net developers out there....<br>Good luck</p>
