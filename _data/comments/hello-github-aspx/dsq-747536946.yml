message: <p>Almost every time I push a c# web project to github, it gets tagged as Javascript, f.e. <a href="https://github.com/ToJans/Scritchy/graphs/languages" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/ToJans/Scritchy/graphs/languages">github.com/ToJans/Scritchy/graphs/languages</a>.<br>I would assume that is the reason c# is not popular enough on github. Fix that and verify again; I would assume figures would change a lot!</p>
