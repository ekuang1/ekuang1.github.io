message: <p>Thank Christ.  I had to use Github on my last C# project, and I swear it was like they went out of their way to make the experience awful on Windows.  The whole thing had me begging for VSS.  (No, I am not exaggerating.  Yes, VSS is awful. It's also capable of identifying the differences between two files and merging them.)</p>
