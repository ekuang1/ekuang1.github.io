message: <p>Congratulations on your new position, Phil!<br>I'd just like to add my vote for bringing Mercurial support to GitHub.  Mercurial is my DVCS of choice for .NET on a Windows platform and I'd love to be able to use GitHub with it.<br>I'll also second the call for you to work on a cool extensibility project (ala TFS's Team Explorer VS add-in) to bring seamless integration with GitHub to Visual Studio.</p>
