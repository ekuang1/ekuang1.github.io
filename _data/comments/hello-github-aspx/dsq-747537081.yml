message: <p>Congrats!<br>I have enjoyed your insights into .net/c#/ and MVC.  GitHub is a really nice service.  I use git and showed a client that is a microsoft shop how to integrate sql source control with git.  The client doesn't see any way they could go back to doing things the old way before git.  Partnering with RedGate seems like a good way to go about producing a killer visual studio plugin for GitHub.  I look forward to the future and the impact your presence will have at GitHub.</p>
