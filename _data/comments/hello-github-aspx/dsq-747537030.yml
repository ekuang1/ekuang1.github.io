message: <p>Terrific move. GitHub needs you, especially in making it easier to learn and use. That's why I don't use it ... yet. Not that I couldn't; or my client's couldn't. It doesn't need dumbing down. It needs to be more inviting. As it stands, it's just not enuf of a priority to make me (or my clients) feel it's worth the climb. There's too much else to do first. You get all that from everything you worked on at MS.<br>Ring me up when you're in SF (my home town)</p>
