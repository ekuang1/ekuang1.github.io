message: <p>Congratulations on the new venture.<br>I'm pleased with the timing of this personally, since I've recently started poking around GitHub and was somewhat put off by the fact that there seems to be very little at the moment in the C#/.NET ecosystem there.  When I saw the graphic you posted from GitHub's site, I wondered if maybe I wasn't in the wrong place and it was mainly for Linux based web development and satellite projects (which is fine for me since I have some background there too, but I work more in C# these days).<br>I'll definitely be following along with your work there, since I've got an idea for a C# project that I'd like to start with my GitHub account.</p>
