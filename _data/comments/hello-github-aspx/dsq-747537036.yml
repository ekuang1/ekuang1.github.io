message: <p>Yay! More power to .net open source! You becoming GitHubberati made me wonder if GitHub is perhaps the antidote to the poison killing me known as CodePlex? We currently host a kick ass CMS at <a href="http://compositec1.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://compositec1.codeplex.com/">http://compositec1.codeplex.com/</a> but not a day goes by where my eyes go teary because of the massive amounts of suck it force us to give our community.<br>We work internally on TFS (and it work well for us) and then sync up to CodePlex via a branch (and that also work well for us). If we can just get a similar setup with an awesome portal, you'd have another .net open source customers (which sport some of your own tech ;-). Just saying - would make a great blog post own how to get there.</p>
