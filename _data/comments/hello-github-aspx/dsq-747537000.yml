message: <p>Awesome! I love GitHub. Hosted one of my private projects on BitBucket, hated the issue system and overall UX, bought a GitHub account for $5/mo. Best investment ever. I think the issue system could be even sweeter when you think about adding custom fields, voting, and "private" issues (a big thing for me, I made a tag that I exclude when I display my roadmap on my app but then my app isn't a public repo).<br>I actually don't have much to complain about with using GH on Windows. Always has worked great for me, but maybe that's because I don't know what I don't know, ya dig?</p>
