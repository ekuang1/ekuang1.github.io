message: "I like the topic of your article so much! I was studying this, and have revealed one useful method of effective staff management.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent employee onboarding survey, carried out by bambooHR, 68% of people leave their workplaces within the first 3 months do so as a result of poor onboarding. The reason for probation difficulties is connected not only with badly thought out training programmes, but also with deficiency in relationships with new colleagues. \r\n\r\nA key element in reaching high levels of employee engagement and motivation is providing employees with development opportunities and enabling them to explore and realise their own potential. Around 74% of employees assume they do not use all of their capabilities while working, which shows that there is a lot more to give. Lack of relationships, the prevalence of theory over practical tasks and unsatisfactory feedback may lead to stress and demotivate employees. Kinesisinc estimates losses due to dismissal of £237 000 each year per employee.\r\n\r\nCollaborative learning is an approach based on the teamwork of the employees' group to achieve a joint purpose. Such an approach allows one to learn from the experience of others, helps to generate more ideas, as well as establishes a solid rapport within a company.\r\n\r\nThis approach is designed to correctly correspond to the needs of employees along with business and used to provide a smooth onboarding process in the company. This method allows people to ask only necessary questions for performing the task. Without wasting time on learning excess information, the employee can increase the work rate applying recently acquired skills, thereby bringing additional profit to the company.\r\n\r\nAs reported by ATD research only 38% of managers are convinced their learning programs are suitable for learner’s needs, while remained 62% of managers suppose their learning programs are ineffective. If most managers are not satisfied with training programs, then it is not difficult to imagine the discontent of employees. This tendency may cause loss of people interest in the work, which will have a negative impact on their productivity.\r\n\r\nCollaborative learning tools provide the opportunity for team members to always stay in touch and solve complicated issues even if somebody works from other location. It is very beneficial for a company in case it can’t replace an experienced employee, who always assists junior ones. Everyone can talk over the possible solutions for colleague's problems and study from the background of others, avoiding the same mistakes in own practice and saving time on resolving issues that have already been solved by the rest.\r\n\r\nI'll be glad if you explore my article more deeply here: https://anuitex.com/blog/post/collaborative-learning-to-achieve-better-results-in-business. And also I'm open to answering any your questions regarding how to increase the employee performance and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"
