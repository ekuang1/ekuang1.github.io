message: <p>A broader theory is the Competing Values Framework (CVF) produced by Quinn. It also explains why certain management methods will totally fail, and which environments match which method.</p><p>The astute reader can even expand upon or change the competing values being used to better reflect their own situations (it's good for 'drifting apart' scenarios which generate the competing values).</p><p>Method matches environment (I would recommend reading "The Principles of Scientific Management" by FW Taylor as a nice piece of history, especially inthe original)</p>
