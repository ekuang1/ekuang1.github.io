message: <p>Hi I was just wondering if you had a suggested approach for the scenario where a user can pick a subdomain name and then do some theming based on that subdomain in mvc4? would RouteMagic route based on subdomain or would it more be an issue of selecting a theme based on the user's subdomain via some kind of routing of the incoming request?</p><p>Cheers,<br>Tom</p>
