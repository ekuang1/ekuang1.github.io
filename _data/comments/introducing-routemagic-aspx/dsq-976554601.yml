message: <p>Hi Phil,</p><p>Thanks so much for the reply. I was looking at emulating the scenario similar to oztix where you have a theme that is applied to a section of the site (in their case a purchase workflow) based on the subdomain and the products list is generated based on that.. I'm assuming the subdomain is some kind of username parameter passed in through the routing and verified and then used to form the basis of a skin. i.e. &lt;user&gt;.domain.com like they do for <a href="http://karnivool.oztix.com.au" rel="nofollow noopener" title="karnivool.oztix.com.au">karnivool.oztix.com.au</a> where they have a themed user page and workflow on the subdomain vs their <a href="http://oztix.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="oztix.com">oztix.com</a> would it be some kind of subdomain routing where the username is passed in as a route argument? I guess then that lends the questions how would you setup <a href="http://username.domain.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="username.domain.com">username.domain.com</a> on the fly as well like lots of ruby apps do i.e. shopify? some kind of db table of users which you validate against for routing?</p><p>I've found this blog post here <a href="http://lukesampson.com/post/303245177/subdomains-for-a-single-application-with-asp-net-mvc" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://lukesampson.com/post/303245177/subdomains-for-a-single-application-with-asp-net-mvc">http://lukesampson.com/post...</a> and similar here <a href="http://blog.tonywilliams.me.uk/asp-net-mvc-2-routing-subdomains-to-areas/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blog.tonywilliams.me.uk/asp-net-mvc-2-routing-subdomains-to-areas/">http://blog.tonywilliams.me...</a></p><p>but wondering if you had a suggested approach mvc4 wise?</p>
