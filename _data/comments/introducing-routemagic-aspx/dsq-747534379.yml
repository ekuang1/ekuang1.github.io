message: <p>So you remove the ability to download the source code. How can we get to the demo that you say exist? You have no example of how to execute routemagic so that we can see the trace. So, all we can do is simply download the assembly without any idea of how to use it. Most of us need to debug our routes and will not need handler and grouping which is the only example. Your site says there is an example but since only the assembly is available we dont have access to the demo. Consider making the souce available again.</p>
