message: <p>What is the best way to work with the project while developing skins?  I installed Subtext, created a blog, copied an existing skin to a new directory and updated the skin.config.  Then I made a few changes to the page template and selected the new skin.  Everything worked great.  But now when I make more changes, no matter what I do, I can't get the changes to take effect.  Does it have to do with the pre-compilation?</p>
