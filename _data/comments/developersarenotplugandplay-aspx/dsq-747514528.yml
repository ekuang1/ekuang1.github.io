message: "<p>You've nailed it, Phil. And in Spain (at least around the body shops I've worked in) that situation, that kind of thinking is <i>everywhere</i>. In every company, in every  manager, even on most developers. Why bother?, they seem to think. We <b>never</b> have the time not only to refine and refactor our code (if it works, don't touch it!), but simply to do a proper analysis before coding. It's sad, because in the end it all just adds to the woes of the two groups of people with the least to blame: customers and legacy coders.</p>"
