message: "<p>In the role of VP Development for a software company, I am at the same time a developer (yes I actually product production code, with unit tests :-)) and an executive.  To be honest this post points out what I believe in general to be the primary problem at most places: the us vs. them attitude.<br>Non-technical management generally doesn't understand the concepts of design debt, agile development, unit testing, SOA, OOA, SAAS etc. etc. etc.<br>Technical developers generally have no clue as to the breadth of issues that must come into play when making decisions in a company of any size.<br>And isn't it fun putting both groups in a room and watching them attempt to communicate.  Perhaps I am blessed with an organization that saw fit to have a CTO (me) who is willing to translate technical arguments into business language and justify business decisions in non-IRS/SEC/FASB language.  I spend hours a week on these tasks and there are days when I'd rather ram my head through the wall.<br>A case in point was today's discussion: The revenue recognition implications of delivering our software using an SaaS model.  The implications to the bottom line (and thus our ability to pay the developers) is significantly impacted by this issue.  There are technical decisions that are driven by the decision about a deployment model that are impacted by this issue.  And I will admit that this time the developers had it wrong, and they were every bit as pig headed about accepting it as they generally accuse management of being.<br>Most developers and development management make very compelling technical arguments for their software development process of choice.  What most don't do is equate that to the real business driver, the bottom line.  To be fair, most executive/financial managers don't ask for this information either.  Both sides seem more interested in standing on the other side of the divide and pitching a fit, than actually trying to communicate in terms that the other group can comprehend.<br></p>"
