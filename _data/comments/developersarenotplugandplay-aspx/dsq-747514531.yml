message: <p>You make a good point.  I don't mean this for ALL managers (I was and am one too in a sense), but it's a common thread among executives.  And I don't do enough to put some onus on developers to communicate this.<br>As for not going into debt in the first place, that would be ideal in an ideal world, but not even I advocate that as being possible.  Sometimes you have to incur a bit of debt because you have to deliver.<br>But like a housing loan, that debt is a strategic investment.  The problem lies in not paying it back, but instead paying your mortgage payments with your credit card.</p>
