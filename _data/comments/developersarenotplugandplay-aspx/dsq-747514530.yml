message: <p>It's as hard to generalize about "management" as it is about "developers," but I've worked with my fair share of developers who were incapable of communicating the value of reducing technical debt and the long-term cost of not doing so. <br>It's certainly not easy, but unless you've got exceptionally good management, you're always going to have to advocate for things like that. <br>I'd also agree with you that the best way to handle the whole situation is to not go into debt in the first place.</p>
