message: <p>Hey, Nice post, that's exactly I was looking for!<br>Just one thing, in Razor, if you attempt to use like this:<br>@Html.RenderAction("SideCategories", "Category") <br>it throws an exception, stating that you have used inproper overload, however, (actionName, controllerName) overload is allowed.<br>But, if you compose like this:<br>@{Html.RenderAction("SideCategories", "Category");}<br>It works as expected!<br>Thanks again!<br></p>
