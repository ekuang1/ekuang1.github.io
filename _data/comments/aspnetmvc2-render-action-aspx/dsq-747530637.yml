message: <p>Sometimes this would be useful like Server.Execute in WebForms. But from the standpoint of architecture this sounds not a good approach since action like Menu is only a portion of View and should stay with View only. Unfortunately it produces an opportunity to allow developers to put View into Controller and thus may be a nightmare for change and maintenence.<br>On the other hand, a Web Form can encompass lots of postback triggers which corresponds to action in the MVC framework. Looking at View, so many actions in a Web Form share the same view. I am afraid this is difficult in the MVC framework. User control can mitigate this job. However, it is still a question how to write less Views or have actions share the same view.</p>
