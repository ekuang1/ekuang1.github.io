message: <p>Regarding forms in partial views, I generally don't put the form in the partial view. I'll do something like this:<br>&lt;% using(Html.BeginForm()) { %&gt;<br>&lt;% Html.RenderPartial("Comments"); %&gt;<br>&lt;% } %&gt;<br>Otherwise, you'll have to add something extra to the form to tell the controller what it should do.</p>
