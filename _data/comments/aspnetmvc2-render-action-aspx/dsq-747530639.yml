message: <p>Hi haacked. today i have a chance to test Html.Action on my controller, the concept is great for rendering static content, like menu, or cached content that you can cached, but like the before html.RenderAction, it's having the same problem issue on running too sync.<br>I tried to run a Html.action on my page with a query in the action that im trying to call. The page have setup 5 Html.action call. My result in my profiler is:<br>Async 1 - From main Controller - 3.1s <br>Async 2 - From main Controller - 2.2s<br>Async 3 - From main Controller - 2.4s<br>-------------------------------------<br>The total operate cost here is only ~3s since it's async<br>Sync 1 - Html.Action - 2s<br>Sync 2 - Html.Action - 2s<br>Sync 3 - Html.Action - 2s<br>Sync 4 - Html.Action - 2s<br>Sync 5 - Html.Action - 2s<br>-&gt; in here is another 10s to run <br>This issue is always the issue of calling Action in Controller. I guess unless you can render the whole <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> view and then detect Html.action, run them async, then render the final output. I believe there is almost no way to make this sufficient.</p>
