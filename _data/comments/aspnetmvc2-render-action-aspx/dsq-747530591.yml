message: <p>One more suggestion, and admittedly this doesn't come from someone who's using ASP.NET MVC right now, so there might already be a way to do this. But it overlaps with some work I've been doing on a different framework so I thought I'd mention it...<br>Since you already have a good typeless URL -&gt; typed parameter parser, why not allow the passing of options as an URL string?  In other words,<br>&lt;%= Html.Action("Menu", "width=400&amp;height=500") %&gt;<br>This allows you to create composable subparts without the burden of strict typing, for instance:<br>&lt;%= Html.Action("Menu", "width=" + Request.Params["menu.width"] + "&amp;height=" + Request.Params["menu.height"]) %&gt;<br>That in turn could have a params-based wrapper so that it could be written as &lt;%= Html.Action("Menu", Passthru("width","height")) %&gt;<br>The end result is that you don't need to use endless generic wrappers to do simple operations - on data that began its life as a generic string anyway.<br>In general I'd love to see more of this, where mvc takes on the strengths of dynamic templating languages like PHP, with the power of typed actions when you need them.</p>
