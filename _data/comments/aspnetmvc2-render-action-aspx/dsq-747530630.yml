message: <p>I'd argue your login form should post to a login action which <em>redirects<em> back to the original form, if your login is a normal form post. If it's an Ajax login, just return a login status view. In that case it doesn't matter where it's called from.<br>I think you may be over thinking this.</em></em></p>
