message: <p>&gt; I'd argue your login form should post to a login action which redirects back to the original form<br>I try to use return Redirect("..."); in the RenderAction, but I get the error "Child actions are not allowed to perform redirect actions."<br>How can I make my RenderAction action return a redirect so that I can use the PRG pattern?<br>(MVC newbie, so forgive me if the answer is obvious)</p>
