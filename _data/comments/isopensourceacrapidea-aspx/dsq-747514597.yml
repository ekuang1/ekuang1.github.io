message: <p>Yep. That's how the most successful OSS projects have run. All of the ideas run through one or two filter people who are either actually writing the code or acting as a gatekeeper for the patches. <br>You can't get two geeks to agree on Kirk vs. Picard. How can  you get them to agree on something as important as a design pattern or on which line the brackets go? If everyone active in an OSS project was submitting patches and/or working on the code it would  be pandelerium.</p>
