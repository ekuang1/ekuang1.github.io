message: <p>My friend Dimitri from down under emailed me these tips:<br><br><br><br>* Start with markup. Look at the comp, study the content elements of the template, then write code on how these should be represented as HTML.<br><br><br><br>* Throw away anything that writes HTML for you. All it'll do is get in the way, although the new 8 from Macromedia is mighty nice -- just don't get into the WYSIWYG mode. Once you're there, you're dead as the markup developer ;)<br><br><br><br>* Cut only what you need. You don't actually need to slice the entire template.<br><br><br><br>* When you cut out a design element, cut to the absolutely smallest size you can cut, but make sure not to get onto the shadows or other color gradations.<br><br><br><br> * When (if) developing comps, make sure to set aliasing to none for text that is supposed to be text. That would help avoiding client's unhappiness when the resulting page looks different from the comp.<br><br><br><br>* Make sure the template passes "stretchy pants" test, i.e. all<br><br>content areas accommodate content of varying sizes and constraints.</p>
