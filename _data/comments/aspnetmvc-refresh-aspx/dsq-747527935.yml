message: <p>Thanks Phil.<br>One problem I'm having is that we, as well as most larger setups, separate out the controllers from the views.<br>It appears all the new GUI features like 'goto controller' do not work in this case ?<br>Is there a workaround for this?  If not, any chance it gets addressed before actual release ?<br>Thanks</p>
