message: <p>wow! a microsoft tool that knows how to download an RC1 product. cool! i wish it had let me upgrade though instead of me having to uninstall and reinstall which is what I seemed to have to do.<br>So is this tool going to tell me when RC2 comes out? i'd hate to go two days without checking your blog and miss out on knowing about a release</p>
