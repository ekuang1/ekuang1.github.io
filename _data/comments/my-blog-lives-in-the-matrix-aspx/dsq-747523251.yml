message: <p>Oh people will read it. You'll be amazed at the number of comments you get complaining about Microsoft's business tactics now. Not to mention all the ones that will blame *you* for any perceived failings in ASP.NET as a whole even though all that stuff was built waaayyy before you started there and you had to suffer right along with them. ;)<br>VM's have always rocked. It's just that more people are noticing it now. My bet is that somebody will come out with an OS that is essentially a consumer level VMWare ESX or maybe even move the vmkernal into a ROM.</p>
