message: <p>Zing!<br>Boy, Joe has been laying out some nice zingers lately. Reminds me of the SNL Zinger vs. Burn skit.<br>But seriously... VMs do rock the Casbah! Of course, I'm still running my site on the bare-metal machine as it's only a single-core machine with 2GB RAM. Then again, the <strike>want</strike> need to move to a VM could be just the thing I need to justify shelling out some $$ for a new box.<br>I love talking myself into stuff.</p>
