message: <p>What about when the VM host goes down and takes all machines down? I'm sure that wouldn't ever happen. Again, anyhow. ;-)<br>I understand the benefits of partitioning - I guess. Seems dumb in this case, as you and Jeff (hopefully) trust eachother, but that's at least a benefit. You're apartment threaded.<br>The portability argument is awesomelly silly, though. You've got a single server doing nothing but serving two websites, and they're both very simple ones. How hard is it to move a SubText install? Backup and restore a small SQL DB, copy a single folder, update config file if necessary. Thirty minutes? It'll take more time (a lot more time) to copy the virtual machine image. So, to allow for the eventual possibility that you'll move servers, you're running three copies of Windows 24/7, and none of them is configured to serve web pages... which is the entire reason for getting the server in the first place. I'm not saying the overall setup is dumb, but the portability argument makes no sense.<br>I've got no beef against VM's as a technology, but the arguments people make for using them are often pretty illogical.<br>Oh... and I know you were joking, but the reason I asked if Operating Systems can detect if they're virtualized is because a virtual machine rootkit would be virtually unstoppable if the OS couldn't tell.</p>
