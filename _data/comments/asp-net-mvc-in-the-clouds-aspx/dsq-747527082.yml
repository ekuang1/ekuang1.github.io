message: <p>@Sean thanks Sean. I might have been offended if I even understood the point he was trying to make. I can't even begin to address it because I don't understand what specifically he means. Is he upset that ASP.NET MVC or Azure isn't OSS? Or is he upset that I'm not participating in Subtext development any more, which is not true as can be seen by reviewing recent SVN check-in comments on <a href="http://build.subtextproject.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Subtext Build Server">our build server</a>.<br>Calling someone a "sell-out" is a really vicious character attack. But without providing any details of what I've sold (and exactly how much did I get for it? Because I could use the extra money in these times :P )<br>Anyways, thanks for commenting Sean. It's much appreciated. :)</p>
