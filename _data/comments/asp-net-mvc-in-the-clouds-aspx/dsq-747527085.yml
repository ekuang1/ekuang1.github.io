message: <p>@Phil -<br>I for one think you, along with Rob and Scott have brought an entirely new way of doing business to Microsoft which I've come to love. You guys now have the resources and manpower to produce amazing systems like the MVC because you understand the importance of listening to the community.<br>I'm a general fan of open-source, where the whole purpose behind it is to propegate the evolution of software. I simply don't see how stoner Mike there can dispute that what you've brought to Microsoft has done just that. If he's referring to Windows Azure, I'd really be interested in hearing how Microsoft is doing anything different then the other big-wig Cloud servers out there. Its the next generation of hosting and I for one, am glad to see MS jumping on that bandwagon. There is no web-based language that rivals <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> MVC riding on C#.<br>This post may seem a bit suck-upish, which wasn't my intention. I simply hate the term "sell-out" and genuinely appreciate yours, and the rest of your gang's contribution to web-development. The MVC framework has reinvigorated my passion for web-development.<br>&lt;/long&gt;<br>Great post, thanks!<br></p>
