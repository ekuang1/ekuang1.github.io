message: <p>I admire that you are able to put up with flames like the first comment Phil. I for one would have deleted that off the bat. It really doesn't add anything and is just a blind insult thrown your way.<br>I commend you for listening and being open rather than slamming the door shut in people's face like Mike. You are in a difficult position, bridging the gap between OSS and MS. I don't think I could do it myself.<br>Keep up the good work man. There are areas where there are shortfalls but in the grand scheme of things I think you are doing the community a real service. As you stated before, you have a thick skin so march on! =)<br></p>
