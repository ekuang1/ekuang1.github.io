message: <p>Mike:<br>Join the dark side and get a free cookie. :)<br>I'm a devout pragmatist, and only got into .NET about a year ago when I started my current job. And with a background in Open Source I must admit that I was not to keen about working with a closed framework.<br>But I am starting to get very comfortable with it, because .NET is by far the best platform I have ever developed on.<br>And after a while I realized that the best way of developing a platform is the way that gives the best results, no matter what license gets thrown on top of it. (As long as you are allowed to freely redistribute said framework to your users)<br>So light up another one and code using the platform that you feel most comfortable with. And if you really feel that .NET is too closed, then join up and start developing lots and lots of free libraries for it. They are the ones you'd want to customize to your needs anyway :)</p>
