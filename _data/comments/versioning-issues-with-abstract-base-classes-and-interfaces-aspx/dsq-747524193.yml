message: <p>Interfaces are the devil and I think they should be avoided at all costs.<br>I used to think they were great, that they provided powerful flexibility and made everything easier but after dealing with just one round of needing to add a single property or method to an interface I discovered their horror.  I've spent months going through systems removing all the interfaces like pulling weeds.  <br>The versioning issue is a nightmare and I cringed when you said "...this means is that new clients of this class need to perform an interface check when they want to call this method every time...".  I've discovered that developers almost never check, they just grab the new methods and assume the system has the latest and greatest thus causing themselves and their clients no end of frustration.  I can completely see why other framework developers came to the same conclusion, it puts burden on everyone and doesn't make anyone's life easier.<br>Hate interfaces... :)<br>Off-topicish feedback, the ASP.NET MVC framework needs some conventions set down now because already I'm seeing MVC projects that put assets in different locations, that are using various folder names for the same types of things, some are calling things "helpers" others call the same "utilities".  One of the major things that makes Rails so powerful as a framework isn't just MVC or ActiveRecord, it's *convention*.  A Rails developer can walk up to any Rails project and know instantly where everything is, knows exactly what is contained in that vendor folder, how the database columns are named and what type of code the helpers contain.  <br>A lot of ASP.NET devs are sort of wandering around stuffing things wherever, sorta lost and making it up as they go which just wastes time and prevents the real work from happening.  There needs to be a Code Tzar inside the MVC camp that says, This Is How It Is, similar to how David Heinemeier Hansson is for the Rails camp.<br>Just a wee bit of feedback :)</p>
