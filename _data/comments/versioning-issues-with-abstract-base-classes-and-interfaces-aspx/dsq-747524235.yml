message: <p>@Francois "The first rule of package dependency is to choose one version, test everything against it, run with it and stick to it. If there is one thing you'll be sure to do when upgrading version, is recompile, run UTs, test plenty and test again!"<br>Absolutely. To say that I should be able to run my deployed application on a new version of the framework that the app has never been tested on is ludicrous. The framework CANNOT guarantee 100% backward compatibility, no matter how hard you try. Therefore the only responsible choice is to only run on versions of the framework on which you have tested. Corporations that say that they want this capability are speaking from ignorance; they don't want to have to do the work of verifying their applications on a new framework version, so instead they want the new framework version to guarantee that it will work with their application, even though it can't possibly make that guarantee. The fact that the .NET design team is perpetuating this absurdity boggles the mind, and forces me to seriously question the commitment of Microsoft to .NET as a long term strategic development platform.</p>
