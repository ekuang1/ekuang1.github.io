message: "<p>re: Constraints<br>I never said I love these constraints. I'm just saying they're there. I've done my part to question them and in hearing the answers, realize it's not black or white. <br>No matter what I think, changing them is not so easy. Think of your own workplace. I'm sure you have constraints you wish you could change, but can't. So you optimize for the constraints.<br>Again, I'll write about that in an upcoming post, and *then* you can skewer me for peddling Kool-Aid. ;)</p>"
