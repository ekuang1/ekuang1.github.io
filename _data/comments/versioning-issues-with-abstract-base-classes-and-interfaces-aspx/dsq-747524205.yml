message: <p>&gt;Who doesn't expect to have to recompile their <br>&gt;application with a new version of the .Net <br>&gt;Framework?<br>Uh, yeah, that would be me. I was quite happy to not have to recompile our apps when 3.5 came out. I'm quite happy that I only need one version of Reflector, not one per framework version. Same with SQL Server. Windows Live Writer. etc, etc, etc</p>
