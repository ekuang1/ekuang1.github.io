message: <p>@chadmyers I forgot to finish my thought... ;)<br>However, MVC itself does have its own context objects (ControllerContext) and I'm investigating some interesting refactorings (based on community feedback as well as my own unit testing problems) that I think will really improve the extensibility, composition, etc... story for MVC. Although you won't see those particular changes at Mix. Maybe the next release if this pans out.</p>
