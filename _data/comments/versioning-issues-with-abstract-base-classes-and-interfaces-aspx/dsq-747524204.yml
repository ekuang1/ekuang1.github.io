message: <p>In what situation will I NOT have to re-compile my code when a new version of System.Web.Extensions is released?  Are you saying there is a way that my code will automatically start using 3.7.0.0 instead of 3.6.0.0?<br>How does adding a new virtual method that throws NotImplementedExcpetion not break my code?  If I do not recompile then anytime that new method is called I get an unhanded exception?<br>Your rationale has not convinced me that I am any better off with an abstract base class instead of an interface.  At least with an Interface I know right away that the contract has changed.<br></p>
