message: <p>@Derek,<br>I wonder what would have happened if Microsoft had chosen to fix the many bugs and reimplement the many poorly designed features that have been reported in .NET 1.1 and 2.0, even if it would have resulted in more breaking changes. Would we have seen a lot fewer companies implement costly workarounds or completely recreate a portion of the framework which didn't meet their needs? Would that have resulted in shorter project turnarounds and greater productivity across the board? Would that in turn have created greater confidence and buy-in to the framework, and accelerated adoption of future versions? I guess we'll never know...</p>
