message: <p><br>Sorry, I was not clear when I said that we serve both of the groups. I did not mean that we make the Framework perfect for both of these groups. We are trying to make it the best we can given we have to serve both of these groups. We try really hard not to break customer’s code and we try to design the framework so it’s malleable (abstract classes) and we are adding features to the CLR (like type forwarders)  to be able to make breaking changes yet shield customers from them, and we try to serve well the customers who want extensibility. We believe we can do it with well designed abstractions (whether they are abstract classes or interfaces). We sometimes fail here and we would love to hear feedback on where you need more extensibility.<br>As to the acceptable loss analysis, we are doing it. We are making some breaking changes in almost every release. The current bar for accepting such changes is very high (security issues pretty much). The bar does not allow for breaking customers because a team wants to add a member to an interface. As I said we are continually looking for ways to allow us more such changes without breaking people.<br>Lastly, it’s not about understanding dynamic casts. It’s about self explanatory APIs. I hope you would not like a framework that is full on members returning System.Object and having to down cast to something else to actually use the return value.<br></p>
