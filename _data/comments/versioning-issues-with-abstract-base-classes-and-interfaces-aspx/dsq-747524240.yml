message: <p>I totally understand Microsoft's position.  Having worked on delivering a framework for the last 5 years I know firsthand the pain that is caused when you introduce breaking changes.  It is not about the fact that you might break 1000 apps, it is about the fact that you might break applications used by hundreds of thousands of users.  One of the "apps" may be a component used in another 1000 apps thereby preventing those dependent apps from being able to upgrade to the latest framework until the component vendor updates their app.  This then creates support problems for the component vendor since they now must maintain 2 versions of their application depending on which framework they are compiling against.<br>In the end it is very easy to say just break compatability, but if you are not the one who must "support" that decision then maybe you ought to cut MS a little slack.  Clearly this is something that they have spent a lot of time agonizing over and whether or not I trust "Microsoft", I certainly trust Scott Guthrie and his team to try to do what is best for the long-term health of the platform.</p>
