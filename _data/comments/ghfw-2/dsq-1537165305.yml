message: <p>Hi!</p><p>Amazing client - thanks. Although supporting Windows 2.0 seems a bit of a step too far in backwards compatibility.</p><p>Three requests:<br>1) Can I right-click on an unsynced change and just sync up to that commit? Reason is I have some "normal" commits followed by a load of tiny, Heroku config-related commits that I'll probably roll up into one commit later.<br>2) Speaking of which - can I please select multiple consecutive local commits and roll them up into a new commit? In this case I'll do it when I've finally got my Heroku settings right, and I'll be able to see those settings easily in one commit.<br>3) Can the error messages be slightly more specific? Not specifying my proxy correctly just prompted me to open up the git shell.</p><p>Thanks for this product though; you made the choice vs Mercurial very easy.</p>
