message: <p>@Haacked<br><br><br><br>Ordered, thx for the link (and it was only 1.99 used)!<br><br><br><br>@Greg<br><br><br><br>I hardly ever code more than 90 minutes straight w/o taking a break (mainly due to meetings, phone ringing, etc).  TBH I think my typing style is f'd up...I've been watching how I type lately and the fingers that are tingly/numb (right index and middle, and left index), I almost always hit the keys w/ the tip of those fingers rather than the pad, and I think that's why they're numb.  I don't do that on "natural" keyboards, only on laptops, which is usually what I'm using.  I may need to retrain my fingers on non-natural keyboards.</p>
