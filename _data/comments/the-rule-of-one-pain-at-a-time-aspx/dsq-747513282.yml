message: <p>I agree about the laptop stuff, and I've been trying to spend more time on my desktop machine (which does have an ergo keyboard...that's actually what I'm used to, jumped on the ergo bandwagon several years ago, but after going independant about a year ago I've mainly been using laptops).<br><br><br><br>I think my typing style is pretty spot on (not self trained, I actually took courses), but I look forward to seeing the recommendations in the book you linked to.<br><br><br><br>As a sidenote, when I worked at MS a few years ago, one of the things they *made* new hires go through was a complete ergo crash course where a "specialist" (could have been a janitor for all I know) comes and monitors you working for about an hour, then makes recommendations on keyboard height, chair adjustments, etc...they realize the liabilities of repetitive stress injuries and took them pretty seriously.<br><br><br><br>I really think it's the laptop :-).</p>
