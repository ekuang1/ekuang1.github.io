message: <p>Amen, brother.<br><br>I agreed with most of Joel's post up until that point myself. Joel even alluded to Eric Sink's article describing the difference between programmers and developers. He should have stopped there. The developers that Eric describes more closely coincide with the "rosh gadol" type that Joel wants on his team, IMO. The rosh gadol type sees what needs to be done, and does it, while still fitting in with the team.</p>
