message: <p>@Jake yep! I corrected my post. Thanks!<br>@Adam locale is not set automatically by default. There's a web.config setting to do that and yes, it should work with MVC.<br>@David that would require doing some sort of currency exchange rate lookup. We don't have a currency type so that's something you'd have to roll yourself.<br>@Sharbel,@McConnell Ha! That's a typo which I corrected. You can see where my mind is lately. ;)<br>@Raphael to localize error messages, see my post on <a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2009/12/07/localizing-aspnetmvc-validation.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="localizing validation">Localizing ASP.NET MVC validation</a></p>
