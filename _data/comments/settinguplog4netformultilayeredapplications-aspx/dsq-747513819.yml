message: <p>Mr. Haack,<br><br><br><br>I used this suggestion along with your first guide for a Winform app. I has worked wonderful, but only on .NET 1.1. I just upgraded my project to .NET 2.0 and I don't get any output (nor errors) from log4net. Do you have any suggestions?<br><br><br><br>Thanks<br><br><br><br>Jes√∫s</p>
