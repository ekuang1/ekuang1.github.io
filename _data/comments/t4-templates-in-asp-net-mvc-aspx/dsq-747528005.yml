message: "<p>@gb: t4 templates can be generated at the command line, so can be integrated into your CI build, or even mapped to a toolbar in the express versions of VS. <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126245.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126245.aspx\">msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126245.aspx</a> It should be found here: &lt;root&gt;\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\Text Templating\\1.1 As to productivity, the most common uses are for ORM and CRUD type forms, but they can be applied to anything repetitive.  With any code generation tool you need to determine whether you will generate once and hand edit forever after, or regenerate whenever your model (or other 'source') changes, overwriting the generated code.  MS tends to present the former pattern in Visual Studio with their project and page templates.  Most ORM type solutions (including linq2sql) tend to follow the latter pattern.  I personally would advise you to follow the latter as much as possible.<br>Hope that helps!</p>"
