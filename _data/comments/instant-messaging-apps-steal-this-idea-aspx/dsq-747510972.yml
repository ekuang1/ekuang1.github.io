message: <p>MSN Messenger doesn't pop the window open, you get the "toast" notification with the first few words.  It does create a new conversation window, but it stays minimized.<br><br><br><br>I'm using the 7.0 beta, which also shows the last few lines of the previous conversation if you do open the window, which is great when you get a "Yes" and forget what that was a response to.<br><br><br><br></p>
