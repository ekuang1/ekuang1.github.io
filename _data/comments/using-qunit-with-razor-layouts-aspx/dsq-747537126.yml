message: "<p>@Saeed, testing javascript is common enough, go ahead and look at some of the more popular javascript libraries and you will probably find unit tests.<br>  Here's a project I worked on which ended up with maybe 800-1000 unit tests: <a href=\"http://allrecipes.com/my/menus/planner.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://allrecipes.com/my/menus/planner.aspx\">http://allrecipes.com/my/menus/planner.aspx</a>  There's lots of client-side behavior, I couldn't have done it without writing tests.<br>  <br>  @Haacked:  One downside of this approach is that you have to open multiple pages to verify all your tests.  I prefer to have a single test page that references all the tests.  I might have multiple test pages to isolate slow tests, or to isolate tests using components like jasmine-ajax that affect all tests once loaded.<br>  <br>  And last but not least, Jasmine &gt; Qunit  :)  <a href=\"http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/\">http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/</a></p>"
