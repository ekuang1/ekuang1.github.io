message: <p>the appender would need to be rewritten to store messages to a queue, and then unload them in a dedicated thread which writes to DB (or, through some interlocked method, marshals each message if you need the writes guaranteed before continuing execution.)</p><p>the problem is a connection creates an ambient transaction on the "Logical" thread (in .NET this will span appdomain boundaries via marshalbyrefobject/remoting, for example.) The next time a connection is opened the existing ambient transaction is enlisted in a distributed transaction along with the new connection. Opening and interacting on a dedicated thread is one of the best ways to avoid this problem. Unfortunately this means the ado appender needs rewriting. ugh... good to know without finding out the hard way.</p>
