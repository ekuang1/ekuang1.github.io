message: <p>Great article, and we have been using something very similar for many years and thought will share another technique that can be used in addition to this. <br>Create an extra table in the database that simply keeps track of your database schema version. When I run a script that modifies the schema I simply insert another record and indicating the current database schema version (1.0,1.1,1.2 etc etc). This allows any team member to know the "version" of the database and what scripts they need to run to get their copy of the database to match the current version.<br>Another advantage is that if your application expects a certain schema, you can program your application to check for the database schema version and ensure that it matches your application's expectations and taking appropriate action (avoid runtime errors).<br>Also, for oracle here are the views that can be used:<br>select * from all_tables -- return all tables<br>select * from all_tab_columns -- returns all columns<br>select * from all_contraints -- returns all contraints - including fk/pk i think<br>oops... just realized that Scott Allen has posted a link to his blog that describes the technique I just mentioned above :)<br></p>
