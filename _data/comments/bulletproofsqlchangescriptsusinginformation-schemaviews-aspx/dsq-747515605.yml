message: <p>These views are great, but when I write a stored proc that uses the view in one database (for instance, master), and try to run that stored proc for each DB, the view returns only the information for master.  I have tried using dynamic SQL to USE DB_NAME() for each, but it still does not work.  Has anyone else run into this?</p>
