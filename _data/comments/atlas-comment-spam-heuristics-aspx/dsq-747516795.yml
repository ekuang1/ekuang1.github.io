message: <p>Love the feedback on NoBot, please keep it up!!<br>I'm the author of NoBot, so I thought I might be able to add some more information here.<br>First, NoBot was not influenced by Haacked's earlier post. The similarity is definitely there [great minds think alike? :) ], but NoBot already existed in pretty much the form it released in for some time before August 29th. I tried to do my research before starting NoBot, and didn't come across too much relevant information. The aforementioned blog post definitely would have been a good find! :)<br>Alan Le's observation that hitting Back in the browser causes problems is a good one and I've made a note to look into the matter. I suspect he's right that the issue is that the issue is related to the browser being "smart" and avoiding another trip to the server. One could probably disable caching for the page via something like "no-cache" (I do this in our automated test suite, for example), but that's not the kind of thing I wanted a control to be doing to its page without very good reason. :) Page authors are, of course, welcome to take this approach if it helps.<br>The comment about the sleep being easily thwarted is both true and not true. :) Yes, bot writers can manually do a sleep, but as Haacked notes doing so will tie up their resources a bit. Probably not enough to stop them, but that's just one of the potentially many schemes NoBot uses to try to avoid bots/spam. Additional suggestions/recommendations are both welcome and encouraged! (Just drop a note to me via my blog and we can discuss your idea.)<br>Mike Dimmick's observation about IP address filtering is another good one. The good news is that NoBot's parameters can be set such that IP filtering is disabled (try setting CutoffMaximumInstances really high or just modifying the code to remove filtering entirely (the source code's free, remember!)). Again, IP filtering is only one of NoBot's schemes. I'd love to have more of them so that folks could pick and choose which ones were relevant to their particular sites/users.<br>Thanks again for the feedback - I hope you find NoBot helpful!!</p>
