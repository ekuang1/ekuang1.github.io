message: <p>Thanks David, I would have been surprised if my post had anything to do with NoBot. That would be too fast a turnaround! :)<br>Forcing a computation on the client is similar to approaches considered for dealing with Email Spam. It's just easier to implement for Comment SPAM as you've demonstrated.  Nice work!</p>
