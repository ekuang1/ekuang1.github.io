message: <p>The problem is in determining the market value of a given employee. It's not that the company will do a comprehensive market analysis for each individual, especially if they are programmers. It's hard to figure out the value a programmer brings to the table. It could be a great model for industries with more transparent relation between employees' work and the company's bottom line but I'm not sure about the software industry.</p>
