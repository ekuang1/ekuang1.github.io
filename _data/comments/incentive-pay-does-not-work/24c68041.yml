  Sometimes an entire department is misclassified and screwed on pay.







  Me: I've written all these really great articles for our research library that have received attention in the field and also developed and gave a lecture using subject expertise. We really shouldn't have the same title, pay, and job description as people who check books out.





  Boss: That's just for your own fun. No one has to work on our serious monthly publication.





  Me: It's not fun for a low-paid, low-title person not making enough for a house to try to meet deadlines for this kind of work. And what do I get out of it, an extra 2 cents on my raise, if that?





  Boss: No one has to do anything.







  Me: That's funny, because when I don't volunteer you ask what I'm going to do rather than "if." But fine, then, I won't do anything if you have less balls than I do and are too scared to even bring the issue up to your own boss.
