message: <p>In my experience teamwork in software industry is a utopia created by business owners to seed a sense of belonging, ownership of something bigger, apparently more important than the individuum. In reality software teams are made of hungry, selfish, envious, sarcastic, intelligent and sometimes smart individuals, who have their own value sets and objectives, everything else its a mascarade.</p>
