message: <p>The Haiburton contracts are a political scandal.  <br><br><br><br>Newsmen tell us over and over that a subsidary of Haliburton over charged millions<br><br>for meals.  We have never been told what or if any punishment or fines were <br><br>leveled.  <br><br><br><br>This Haliburton Cheney story needs to stay on the front page.  Demostrations,<br><br>law suites on behalf of taxpayers, something has to keep this scandal in the<br><br>face of voters.<br><br><br><br>Nixon said he was not a crook.  Haa Cheney taken that line?<br><br><br><br>Congress needs to pass a new law stating that no contract can be made between<br><br>a President or Vice Presidents past employers or any company in which either<br><br>official was employed and the United States government without the consent<br><br>of both houses of congress.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The Haliburton sweet deals were pure political graft.</p>
