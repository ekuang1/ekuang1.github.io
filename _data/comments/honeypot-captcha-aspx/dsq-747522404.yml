message: <p>This simple technique really works because the bots are so badly written most of the time. Unfortunately you can't go much beyond this without seriously hurting accessibility, which is a shame because a nice javascript hashcash would really put a dent in the spammers whilst not requiring users to figure out increasingly obscure captchas.</p>
