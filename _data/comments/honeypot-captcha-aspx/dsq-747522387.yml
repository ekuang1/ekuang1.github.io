message: <p>I've used something similar on my YaBB forum for a while now and it works brilliantly, I went from around 5 bot accounts being registered every day to zero.<br>The signup page of my forum has a couple of radio button and prompts users to click "yes" to signify their acceptance of the TOS. Renaming these buttons and adding similar with the question "Are you a spambot?" gets them every time :-)</p>
