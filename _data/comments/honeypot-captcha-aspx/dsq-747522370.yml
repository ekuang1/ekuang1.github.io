message: <p>The id of the captcha should be random dictionary words so that the spambot can't ID it.<br>It should never be author, email, or url because genuine commenters with Comment Pre-fill forms will be hit with it.<br>(I hit Alt-C and fill in my name/email/url on all WordPress blogs, for example -- and would mark me as a spammer instead of the wonderful commenter that I am :) )</p>
