message: <p>Hello.<br>This is a fairly elegant solution to a problem that plagues blogs and boards all over the web. I found this article right after implementing the very same solution on my new web development blog. I hope this cuts down on the 'poker' and 'adult' spambot comments that have been showing up in my database.<br>Good article, by the way. Comments spanning almost 4 years and people are still commenting :) Good stuff.</p>
