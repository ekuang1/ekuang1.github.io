message: <p>@ vakantie<br>It's an eternal war. Just see it as a game. Hackers will always be able to crack new kinds of protection, and then they will come up with something new, and then they will hack it again. It's just fun for both parties if they don't take themselves too seriously. Keeps us busy and our intellect sharp :)</p>
