message: "<p>Instead of using Id's to label your for elements, why not use classes?  Then you could have, say, 2 comment elements, 2 title elements, 2 url elements, et cetera.  Once you have them, hide one of each and don't accept anything that fills in the display:non elements.  Then it wouldn't be able to distinguish between the real and fake ones.  <br>Since css allows for multiple classes per elements, you could have, say:  &lt;div class=\"sweet url\"&gt; and &lt;div class = \"sour url\"&gt;.  Then you could distinguish between the right and wrong one in your code.</p>"
