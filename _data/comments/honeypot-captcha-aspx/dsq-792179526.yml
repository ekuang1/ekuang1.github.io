message: <p>I know this is really old, but I had to reply as I had a fun answer.  My site was getting hit 100s of times a day by the same spammer, so I took any incoming requests coming from that IP address and bounced them back to that same IP address.  So basically I spammed the spammer with his own spam.  :^)</p>
