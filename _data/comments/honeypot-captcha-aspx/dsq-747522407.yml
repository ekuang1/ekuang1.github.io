message: <p>Actually this is one of the few articles I could find that shows the principles of an efficient solution against automatic forms submission.<br>And you can go a step further by randomizing the various elements that are in the css and/or generate the css/stylesheet on the fly. So for each page load a different css and vary the number of invisible elements with the form. If you check the HTML and CSS specs, they also have certain rules you could take advantage of. For instance, if the same css tag or css field inside the tag is repeated the last one overrides the first. You can also have tags in comments. All of which lead to more and more complex bot structure to identify something and submit a form.<br>Anyways, I totally agree and I found it pathetic to say the least, to bloat forms with crossed-out images and mysterious active scripts and other ajax and anti-ocr methods to identify if it's a bot or a human who submits a form. <br>So you can secure 100% your forms without adding anything extra that is visible to the visitors.</p>
