message: <p>&gt;&gt;Dare I &gt;&gt;say...System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex? <br>Matt, I totally agree, however this is programmer laziness rather than ignorance.  I try to avoid sounding dogmatic, but I believe that regular expressions is an entry-level skill for programmers.  It's one of the most powerful and widely-applicable domain-specific language out there.</p>
