message: <p>Just wait until I get my "this song will download to your machine while you read my blog and you'll have to listen to it" up and running...oh wait, MySpace already has an annoying feature like that.<br><br><br><br>On a serious note, I do have to agree w/ Phil on this one...coming from a strong musical background it's nice to see the tunage being listened to whilst the bloggee ws posting...if only they could make a plugin for WinAmp...I only use WMP for pr0n. ;-)</p>
