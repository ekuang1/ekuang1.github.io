message: <p>I agree with Sergio - your site suddenly came to a crawl yesterday when I was here looking up and old post. It was likely due to the Coral changes you had made and all of that re-caching, DNS lookups, etc... that go along with it. At any rate, <a href="http://haacked.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="haacked.com">haacked.com</a> seems to be back up to speed now.</p>
