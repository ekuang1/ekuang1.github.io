message: "<p>Is that cut-off in PDT? :)<br>IMHO NFoo implies a 'port' of the Foo project? (NHibernate, obviously, being a/the prime example)<br>In the  most civilized manner possible, I'll add 2 more names for no real reason (since the finalists are already chosen :)<br>#1 - since it's not about fetching arbitrary packages (we're not installing applications AFAICT, in contrast to what apt/dpkg/rpm/etc can do), focus on the role of 'get this dependency' - ***DepFetch*** (google shows it not having any obvious usage currently)<br>#2 - gem makes sense for ruby (obviously).  In similar fashion, we could find a name based on the Iron* line of naming (especially as a show of support as those teams have suffered).  Combined with a focus on simplicity, and inspired by my son's favorite movie (Cars), we get Rust-eze or ***RustEze*** (PascalCasing for Anders reasons :).  We even get a Billy Mays-like tag line for free: 'Bringing you libraries with the Power of Oxygen!'  ... there are shorter, dorkier versions around too, of course, like 'Some assemblies required' :)</p>"
