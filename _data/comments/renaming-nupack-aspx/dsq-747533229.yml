message: "<p>Don't want to be too harsh, especially since you're not the one to blame, but I have to agree, they aren't really good. SnapFetch actually isn't that bad, it's just a bad name for a Packaging System IMHO. Same for NFetch. DotNetPack and OuterPack are just uninspired and Bland :(<br>I know, no suggestions, but I still make some, e.g. the PowerShell-styled \"Get-Packages\", or something that has Repo(sitory) in it. Or something that's really made up. \"Parcels\"? \"NetLets\" (inspired by CmdLets)? \"FuncBits\"? (Functional Bits, as in Bits and Pieces).<br>I don't know, all I can say is: I really recommend taking another shot at this.</p>"
