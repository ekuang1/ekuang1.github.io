message: <p>Hmmmmmmmmm...<br>A New Package Manager, what to call it? NuPack? Apparently not.<br>Pacman? What do you mean its already taken?<br>Well what about Packman? Too Close to Pacman?<br>HaackMan?  Too personal?<br>Get Me Code - GMC - more about trucks.<br>MSVSPM - We all know how much Microsoft like acronyms (Microsoft Visual Studio Package Manager)<br>GuPack (named after that red polo) still too personal?<br>RedPolo? - does RedPolo have a chance? - All .net developers will think that they have their very own guy in a red polo running around fetching their code.<br>OK naming stuff is a bit more difficult than first imagined, especially Big Company Stuff.<br>Just call it Brian.<br></p>
