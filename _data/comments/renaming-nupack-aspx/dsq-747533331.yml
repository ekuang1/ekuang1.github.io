message: <p>hmm..<br>- No "Nu" because so many future users will wonder what this is.<br>- No "Iron" because this is not a DLR related project. Much confusion will come.<br>- No "N" prefix unless you really want to hint people this is ported from other platforms. This is no longer the case for many apps with similar naming but still I may think so when reading such name.<br>- No "Fetch" or words that need better explanation of the job of the thing<br>Then what? Really couldn't think of something sold enough. Maybe ".NET Package Explorer"? It should be as easy and straight forward as this (without more geekiness or special name parts). Not saying it should be exactly this one though, but you get the idea...</p>
