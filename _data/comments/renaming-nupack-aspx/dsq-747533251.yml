message: <p>Could go for the Russell Brand approach:<br>Haack's Paacky Whaack<br>But I guess things that sound like open source projects works aswell.<br>NDubz did it when they stopped producing their music in Java and used .NET Framework insted. NHybernate isn't on iTunes yet.<br>What about SubPack? Sounds slightly healthier than McPack.</p>
