message: <p>Question. How many people have to comment on the absurdness of the choices given, in order for the team to realize that the factors for choosing the name would never result in a good name?<br>Just ask Jeff Atwood what happened when he let the community brainstorm names for their newly launched stack exchange sites, but limited the suggestions to those with a domain available. He launched, and then reverted the name (and redirected the domain). At least he had the courage to do so. With NuPack I don't think it's gonna revert, no matter how bad it is. Sadness.</p>
