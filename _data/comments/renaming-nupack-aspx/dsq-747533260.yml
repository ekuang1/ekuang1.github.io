message: <p>All of the proposed names are horrible. If you insist that these are our only choices... well, shucks then I guess, I vote for none of them.<br>If you wanted us to propose a name... then I'd rather have NCase, but that's also taken... damn. I feel your pain, but again, those proposed names are worse than nupack.</p>
