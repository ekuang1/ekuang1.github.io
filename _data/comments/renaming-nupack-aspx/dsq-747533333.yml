message: <p>I knew this would happen the moment it was announced. Microsoft either comes up with names like Extended Package Manager Professional 2010 Live or something like NuPack.<br>Outercurve is pretty silly too. Funny, since I think Codeplex is a really good name.<br>Anyway, I'm not voting, new names are silly too.</p>
