message: <p>Trying to be civil about it, but it's hard. NuPack is soooo much better. Part of the allure of "gem" is that sounds cute and works well as a noun. "There's a gem for that"!<br>Therefore I really like one suggestion by "GP" above, "NuGet", which could easily be transformed into "nugget" (maybe in pronunciation only). "I'll just get a couple of nuggets to complete this task".<br></p>
