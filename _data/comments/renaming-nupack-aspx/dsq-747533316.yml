message: '<p>I agree these names suck :)<br>I vote for no name change or nPack.<br>Off-topic: why not learn from Mercurial and make your commands less verbose e.g. add instead of add-package, list instead of list-packages, etc...  maybe even np instead of nupack or npack.  so you can do things like<br>np list<br>np add<br>etc...  less typing = no carpel tunnel = good<br>Nice work though and I will try and contribute whenever I have time.</p>'
