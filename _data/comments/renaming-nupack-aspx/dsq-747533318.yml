message: "<p>In honor of the Lewis and Clark expedition: Packagawea<br>But seriously, the given names suck. So let me make a serious suggestion I came up with while thinking about names this morning: Modularizer. <br>It's descriptive, it's cooler than any of the given names. And since I liked the name regardless of whether it gets used or not, I registered the domain and would be happy to donate it to the cause.</p>"
