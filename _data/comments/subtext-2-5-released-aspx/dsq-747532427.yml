message: <p>I'm having a heck of a time with the upgrade.  Biggest issue right now:<br>Go to <a href="http://www.blogcoward.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.blogcoward.com">http://www.blogcoward.com</a>, and it says I'm in the middle of an intall.  Go to <a href="http://blogcoward.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blogcoward.com">http://blogcoward.com</a>, and everything displays fine.  Is that one of the bugs you are working on?  if not, could you ping me offline?<br>"The type initializer for 'Subtext.Extensibility.Providers.EmailProvider' threw an exception." is another one.<br>Help!</p>
