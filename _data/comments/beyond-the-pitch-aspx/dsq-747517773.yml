message: <p>I am much more of a fan of indoor soccer, mainly because even in the summer in Wisconsin it can still get cool.  Plus with indoor soccer it is basically great skills with the speed of hockey.  This is a cool idea though especially when the Galaxy has some extremely good virtually unknown players.</p>
