message: "<p>@Jeff: Your analogy breaks down my friend. If you change \".com\" to \".org\". You get a different site. If you change \"http://\" to \"ftp://\" you get a different protocol.<br>But if I change \"www.\" to \"\", I get the same exact thing. Ergo, the \"www.\" is superfluous.<br>But yes, it's academic.</p>"
