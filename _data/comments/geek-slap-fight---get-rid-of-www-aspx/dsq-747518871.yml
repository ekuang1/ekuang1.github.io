message: <p>The rest of the world still very much uses www so those of you in the development side are probably the only guys who think it's redundant.<br>I don't know why they ever added it in the first place... I suppose a way of seperating intranets or closed networks from public ones. But, it was fairly obvious that this wouldn't be the case.<br>I do think they can use this idea to help curb 'dodgy' websites being viewed by kids... but I heard that the court through out that idea. I was a little upset about that.<br>I'm not keen to have to register two domain names just for the sake of geeks who are too lazy to type www like the rest of the world. Viva www!</p>
