message: <p>Phil, I'm in complete agreement with you. Moving beyond www is one of my minor personal crusades.  Here's what I tell my clients:<br><em>&lt;RANT&gt;</em><br>Don't put <strong>www</strong> on your letterhead, emails, or your business cards.  Your website is a "modern" website that doesn't need the www.  It does accept it for folks who unknowingly add it, but don't encourage them.<br>Open up any Newsweek, Better Homes &amp; Gardens, or Car &amp; Driver and look at the ads.  Do they advertise their websites as <a href="http://www.ford.com?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.ford.com?">www.ford.com?</a>  <a href="http://www.priceline.com?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.priceline.com?">www.priceline.com?</a>  <a href="http://www.nike.com?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.nike.com?">www.nike.com?</a>  No. The www is a distraction and weakens your brand.  Let's move into the twenty-first century folks and drop the www.<br><em>&lt;/RANT&gt;</em><br></p>
