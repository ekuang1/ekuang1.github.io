message: "<p>Which begs another question, why are we visiting the site at all when the posts are delivered to us via RSS/ATOM?<br>answer: Comments. The inescapable urge to share our wit and wisdom with the other readers of the site. The need to educate/show up the author with our own comment. The CommentAPI ain't there yet, so we have to resort to going to the site.</p>"
