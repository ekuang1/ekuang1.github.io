message: "<p>Thought I'd put a thought in on the subject.  I say let's get rid of the \"www\" altogether.  It's always been useless to me.<br>As far as the http:// ftp:// debate goes, I actually use ftp:// a lot.  It's not necessarily redundant, but it's hardly used by the general public (hey, \"general public\" is redundant).<br>The Interstate debate starting up:  In some areas, the people might just say \"The 5\" or \"The 405,\"  but that's not how we say it in Alabama.  It's \"I-85\" and \"I-65.\"</p>"
