message: <p>Im sorry but in the context of professional corporate large scale web projects legibility means squat and you better damn well know your shorthand properties or pick them up quick. You should be hand-coding optimized css, if you need to use a compressor you are wasting time putting in those extra returns and typing out full properties and time = money. =P<br>.selector {margin:10px 20px; padding:10px;}<br>This is how your code should be written from the start.</p>
