message: "<p>I use CSSClean all the time (especially with how VS always screws up my CSS formatting). Or yes, CSSTidy.<br>As to \"less experienced web developer\": running the risk of sounding elitist, I would hope that they'd learn it pretty quick or else you have bigger problems (how hard is this basic CSS? Just remember top/bottom and left/right).</p>"
