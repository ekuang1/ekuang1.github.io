message: <p>I have to agree with James white American women are less receptive to asian men. I have traveled quite a bit around the world and the white women i've met outside of the US are much more receptive than their counter-parts here in the states. White women in the states are more 'stand off-ish, I guess it's because we regard them as such beautiful, sexual, 'perfect' women that they hold themselves higher.(note not all american women are like this, but more so than the ones outside the states)</p>
