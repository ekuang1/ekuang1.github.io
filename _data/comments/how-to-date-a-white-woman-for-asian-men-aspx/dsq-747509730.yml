message: <p>I am Indian Bengali Male that grew up in Boston. When they talk about Asian, I don't think they mean Indian or South Asian also because Indian women only marry Indian men and Indian men only marry Indian women. I know lot of White guys love Indian girls but Indian girls stick to their own kind. Lot of my White male friend constantly bugging me to hook them up with Indians girls but the Indians rejects them saying they don't like White Trash. As for the Indian male, we also get lot of White girls just fool around with them but never marry them or go out with them, we only marry Indian women. I never saw Indian women with white men or any other kind, or Indian men with White female or any other kind. My cousin married a men from another part of India. Our whole family disapproved it and started rumors about her and looked down upon her and the guy and guy was a doctor which is big plus for Indian. <br>Here are some reasons why Indian women and Indian men stick to each other.<br>1) Indians do arrange marriage and Indian have big family pressure<br>2) South Asian (pakistanis, Indian and Bengalis) both males and females prefer to hang out with each others in schools and college which create bonds and friendships<br>3) Indians females watch and love Indian films (Bollywood) rather than English film (Hollywood)<br>4) 99% of the Indian females find Indian males attractive and also 99% of Indian males find Indian girls attractive than other race. <br>5) Indians culture is unique to Western culture like food, clothing, views and religion. Indians, both female and males love their culture and want to marry someone who knows the culture and religion.<br>6) South Asian have strong community like South Asian parties, family gathering and more</p>
