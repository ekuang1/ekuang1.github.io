message: <p>I don't think it has anything to do with racisim, as was stated earlier.  I think it has more to do with personal preference.  I'm a 25 year old white woman, and I just don't find Asian men to be attractive physically.  I do, however, find some African-American men to be attractive, and have dated a few and slept with a few.  I also find some Latino's attractive, and have had nights of passion with them as well...so obviously it's not racism in this case.  All in all, I'll stick with the white meat.  Again, personal preference.</p>
