message: <p>I want to add that many times when I (a white American from Maryland and Delaware) have been hit on by women, they have typically been Taiwanese or Chinese, and extremely beautiful.  White American women that I have approached have always been cold and elusive or not physically attractive.  They've been angry or confused about the type of men they want to date.  The white women I've been friends with come to me in tears because of the way men treat them, yet they've never wanted to have anything to do with me on a sexual level.<br>However, I've never tried to have a relationship with Asian women due to my own prejudices that I should be with a white woman.<br>I've endlessly searched the Internet to try to find the answer to the question of why women of Asian ethnicity find me attractive while women of my own race don't.  Many sites claim that White men marry Asian women due to a sort of Asian fetish among white men.  Well, traditionally I've not been attracted to Asian women so it's not a fetish on my part. It is the women who hit on me.  Yet these very same women who approach me are hit on by other white men who do seem to have this fetish. (One guy who hit on a woman who found me attractive declared "I love Asian women").<br>These men are denied by the objects of their desire and watch these women leave with me.<br>Does anyone have any insight as to why this is the case?  <br>(As a side-note, I am beginning to let go of my prejudice and embrace the idea that perhaps I was not meant to date women of my own race)</p>
