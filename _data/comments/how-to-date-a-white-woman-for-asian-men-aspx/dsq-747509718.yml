message: <p>Umm... experience is the best teacher. Not some stupid book. <br>I've been with women from nearly races (black, east-asian, white, latino, mid-eastern, south-asian), but it's been mostly with the Caucasian ones. Why? Cuz that's just my personal preference.<br>Im from the Philippines (Asia) and my sweetheart is from Belarus (Europe). We're both migrants to New York City and met each other here. Although I've been here since I was young... So despite our different backgrounds, we got a lot in common and have great compatibility.</p>
