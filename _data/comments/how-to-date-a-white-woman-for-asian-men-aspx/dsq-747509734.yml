message: <p>Sam, you know plenty of Indian and white marriage in your fantasy dream, in reality it less than 2%. Yo, in England and Europe Indian women are Westernized since many of them are there for more than 2-3 generation but their presence in England is stronger than ever. Now they represent 5% of Uk's population. White men try hard to marry Indian girl since White men find them super attractive but they fail because Indian women donâ€™t like White crackers. Know this, Princess Diana wanted to marry a Pakistani guy but the guy refuse because his family won't accept it. Now the White Men in Uk accused the Indian and Muslims for not integrating just as American accused Latinos or Spanish people for not integrating because they marry from the same culture and want to keep their rich alive.</p>
