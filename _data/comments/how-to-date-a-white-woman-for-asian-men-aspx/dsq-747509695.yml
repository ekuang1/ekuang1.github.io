message: <p>Ha ha... doesn't touch a nerve.  <br><br><br><br>It's just that joke is promoting an outdated negative stereotype of Asian males.  I knew it wouldn't take long to appear in the comments. It's just way too easy pickings.  And you went there.<br><br><br><br>And strangely enough, I still find it funny.  It's probably the choice of using the word "wiener".  Use it in any sentence and the sentence is immediately funny.  I love crass jokes.<br><br><br><br>So officially. Shame on you.  Unofficially. Ha ha. ;)</p>
