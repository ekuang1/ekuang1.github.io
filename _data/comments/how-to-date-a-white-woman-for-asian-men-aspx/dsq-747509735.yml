message: <p>I'm dating a 6'1 asian (100% chinese) guy, so not all asians are short, that is a stereotype as is the thing about penis size lol.   We have not been intimate but I assure you there is no issues there.<br>But yea there sure is a stereotype on penis size. I told a friend I'm dating a chinese guy and first thing was about that....<br>Amazing, how people are so dumb.<br>(I am 5'7 blonde hair, blue eye, ) No, I never dated a chinese guy before, but only as I never met one who I clicked with....<br>Anyway, interesting reading . Been looking up some things about inter racial dating for us since he is very ok with it but told me to prepare for some issues here or there.</p>
