message: <p>Not really. A lot of people care about color although you may not. If people do not care about race why are there segregated communities such as Mountain Brook in Alabama or Littleton. In Mountain Brook, Alabama, there are absolutely no Asians..kids in the school grow up without ever knowing an Asian. First is exposure..second is racism..too many questions being asked as to why asian women date white men. If you are interested in reducing racism, we need to ask why white women do not date Asian men..religion may be a reason..but most likely reason is racism. Even in Asia where white American women who attend church with locals do not date any locals from the church! Not so with white men!</p>
