message: <p>Well...I'm asian-european and I find 'almost'(I don't want to sound rude so..= &gt; almost) only asian guys attractive.<br>Well you can call me a weirdo that I find them HOT!(and very cute)*giggles*.Cause asian/white girls prefer white guys(well the more choice for me(^_^)..  I think that's weird that other asian women prefere  white guys.They are tall and 'act' more masculin and asian women are very feminime and short.(And I don't think bodyhair is attractive) Well one of the reasons most girls don't want an asian guy is probably because most of them are shy...how many times that it happened that a white guy offers you a drink and say things like you are so beautiful and other crap..well asian guys are very shy...and because of that they look like they don't have any interests.If someone is asking to them "Isn't she hot".He would normally blush.well not all but mostly...I think this is very cute and I am very shy too...and they are more polite and decent(well most of them).I'm a decent girl.<br>Oh and btw I find it slutty that girls care about size of penis.</p>
