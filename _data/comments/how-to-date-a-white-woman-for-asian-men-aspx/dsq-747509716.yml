message: '<p>Wow, two posts in one month... I must be on a roll. This one is more of a hypocritical observation turned rant. It?s OK when I do it, but I don?t want to have to watch you... Apparently this is a wide spread issue (Come on, go to the link, the Amazon review for a pair of underware are not NEARLY as funny as the ones for say... ?How to Date White Women... A Guide for Asian Men?, Amazon removed the offensive {read: hilarious} reviews, but that doesn?t stop the Internets from recording their existence.) But still, at what age exactly do men decide that it is perfectly acceptable to adjust their pants in public?

I mean, waiting for the subway, in the ticket line at the movies, at the deli, on college tours... Dad... There are different maneuvers that can be accomplished to both relieve yourself and make some attempt to adjust ?your self.?

One of the people behind you will always find the free teller first and treat you like an asshole for personally slowing down their day and taking up their time. Rollins called it murder to the Nth degree. Not so if your doing it intentionally, it?s fun. I save those minutes I steal from peoples lives throughout the day and keep them in jars in the in the basement. It?s like a retirement fund. TIME is a function of the UNIVERSE, it is not relative to YOU. You are not running on different time than US. How about I loan you an hour, some time around the fall equinox; but I?m going to expect that hour back and maybe some interest. Interest... I?m in line at the bank... So you have two choices ? you can either catch up on the newest home mortgage rates for smiling diverse CitiBank families posted on the far wall (How nice, the Asians will be buying a home with their newly approved loan and the African-Americans got low interest debt consolidation account. Something tells me, despite the smiles, the Asian...</p>'
