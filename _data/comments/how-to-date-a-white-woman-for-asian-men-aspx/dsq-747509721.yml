message: "<p>This book must be a joke. It implies that an Asian man can simply buy a book and learn the secrets and techniques to date a white woman. I'm sorry it just doesn't work that way. Women are a fickle bunch, and they either see something in you or they don't. This goes more with personality, looks, succesfullness, education and less so with race.<br>Regardless, I hardly think Asian men are \"stealing\" white women. I find this almost opposite to my observations. I usually find white men drawn to Asian women and Asian women to white men. One Asian woman replied that size really did matter. The stereotypes aside about Asian endowment or lack of generally isn't a requirement to date a white woman. Chances are you will have to put in major investment: time and money dating here before she will even want to see your cock. It doesn't make a difference whether you are white or Asian. I do notice that in gay circles there is a huge difference. Asian guys almost exclusively date outside their race. Take a look at some of the Asian profiles on any gay personals site. It's typical to see GAM seeks GWM instead of GAM. Regardless these Asian men aren't stealing any white men either. They date according to their tastes and preferences. But a book revealing who to satisfy your personal fetishes. It's laughable but a sucker is born every minute.</p>"
