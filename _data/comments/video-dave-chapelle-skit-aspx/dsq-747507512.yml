message: <p>I... I just don't get the appeal of Dave Chappelle. I mean, he's not too bad but he really doesn't warrant the accolades that he recieves. Then again, I guess I should take into account the effect that trends tend to have on most people where they think that every "new" thing is simply the greatest until the next "new" thing comes along, on which they cling to and proclaim it the best. As far as I see it, there is nothing new under the sun therefore there is comedy that I see as timeless and classic whereas I don't see his stuff as being such... but, of course, I could be wrong. I mean, come on, though, "I'm Rick James, bitch!" who's going to know who the hell Rick James is in twenty years? Hell, I don't even know nor give half a shit as to who he is now. I think people need to look at entertainers for what they are and quit giving them more credit than they deserve. Actually, really, the thing I find to be pretty funny is how people will down-play others' belief systems and idols but then turn around and praise someone to no end, you know, kinda like making an idol of that person. Hmmm... oh well.</p>
