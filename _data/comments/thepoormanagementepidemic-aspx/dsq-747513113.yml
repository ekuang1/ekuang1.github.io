message: "<p>Jerome Alexander has written a good book about how this epidemic gets its start, incubates, and then infests the entire organization.  He has lots of real live examples and stories from his own experience plus some pretty advice.  I would recommend it to people both below and above the middle manager level.  That's where the problem is.  \"160 Dgrees of Deviation:  The Case for the Corporate Cynic.\"  Read it!</p>"
