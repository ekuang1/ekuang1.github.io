message: <p>Kristof, might be worth taikng a look at <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/532121/tons-of-package-did-not-load-correctly-errors" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/532121/tons-of-package-did-not-load-correctly-errors">connect.microsoft.com/...</a> - it describes those package loading errors and has a suggested workaround. The workaround didn't work for me - said I already had a new version installed of the packages it recommended manually installing - but for the time being the problem seems to have disappeared anyway, fingers crossed.</p>
