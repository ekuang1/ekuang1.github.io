message: <p>NickS - Steve Sanderson actually wrote MvcScaffolding which, I think, is the technology used to do the scaffolding.I know for a fact that you scaffold out everything in the command line and include a "-repository" switch that puts everything in a nice repository. Since the Add Controller dialog is extensible, I wouldn't be surprised to see a repository template soon.</p>
