We can deploy the site to the machine later."<br>Please help me, this is my senerio: I have a Windows XP Machine (the Source Machine with my ASP.NET MVC 3 App. built on VS 2010 with Razor View engine ready to deploy).  I have a Test Server (the Destination Server)within our organization to which I have full Admin rights.
