message: <p>I think a lot of peoples' issues with installation have to do with an conflict when the installer tries to execute vs10-kb2483190-x86.exe. I get the same hanging and eventual error described by a lot of commenters, and when I go to the temp directory that the installer uses and install all of the MSIs individually it works fine. This is the second tools update with this issue.</p>
