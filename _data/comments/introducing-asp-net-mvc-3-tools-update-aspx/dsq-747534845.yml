message: <p>okay, the problem is bigger than I thought.  It appears the the modernizr-1.7.js file is breaking across several of the audio codecs, not just theora.<br>I am running VS on a VM with no installed audio device (the host server does not have one to assign).<br>Could this be the issue, and if so, how can I fix it?<br>Even removing the modernizr files from the script folder, deleting them from the project and rebuilding doesn't work, as VS dynamically replaces them on debug.<br>I'm new and trying to learn this, but the environment keeps killing my efforts.  Any help would be appreciated.<br>Thanks</p>
