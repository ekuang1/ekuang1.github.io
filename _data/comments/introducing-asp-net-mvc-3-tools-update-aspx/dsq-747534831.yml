message: <p>It seems that only the people with problems are posting here? The only issue I had was that it failed to download via WPI (too much traffic?). After 3 attempts, I finally downloaded the installer, and it worked without a problem.<br>I've already been using MvcScaffolding, Modernizr, and CodeFirst on every new project, so having it all 'baked in' now is nice.</p>
