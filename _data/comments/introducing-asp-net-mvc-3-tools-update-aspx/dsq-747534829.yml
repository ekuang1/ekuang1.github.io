message: <p>After installing this update and then working with my previously existing MVC 3 project with Razor view engine the designer is basically useless as now Visual Studio will lock up as soon as I start to type in a cshtml file.  I then get the "Visual Studio is busy with an external operation...".  Eventually it comes back until I type something else.<br>Gerry</p>
