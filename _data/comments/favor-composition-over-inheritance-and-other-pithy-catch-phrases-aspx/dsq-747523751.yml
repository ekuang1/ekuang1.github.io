message: <p>Larry makes a good point, the definition of the word "favor" seems glossed-over. But, maybe Phil is vehement about not even favoring a practice because it is still a rule, even if not black and white.<br>As an aside, ALT.NET (the label and the movement) makes me think of the adage "nonconformity _is_ conformity".<br>The thing I DO like about ALT.NET is their tendency to, as Phil wishes above that it was their only tendency, "... focus more on the principles of thinking for yourself and a desire to improve."<br></p>
