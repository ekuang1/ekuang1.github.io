message: <p>You wrote your rant as if "favor" means "always use".  It doesn't, and I don't think that most people think it does.  I can *always* favor composition over inheritance, but that doesn't mean I will always *use* composition instead of inheritance.  I dunno, I suppose that's the entire point of this entry, but to me it seemed like you are arguing over a straw man.</p>
