message: <p>While it is true that most of our community once they have learnt a pattern, regard every problem as a nail to be pounded with their newly crafted hammer, this particular advice is one of the best counterpoints to the legion vast who have yet to realize that inheritance implies an  'is a' relationship rather than a simple way to reuse the code of the superclass.<br>Likewise, there is nothing inherently wrong with the singleton pattern, nor the template pattern, each has its merits and it is the inappropriate application of said patterns that cause such great consternation.<br>There are far too many absolutes in our community and not nearly enough rational advice, this piece of advise is not one of them, it just needs to be explained in terms of a 'is a' and 'has a', and it makes much more sense.<br>In any case, describing a sentence prefixed with the word 'prefer' as 'pithy' seems out of place.<br></p>
