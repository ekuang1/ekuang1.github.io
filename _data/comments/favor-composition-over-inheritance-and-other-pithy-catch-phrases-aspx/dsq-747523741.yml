message: <p>I couldn't agree with more with this.  I feel that often times people back themselves in to a corner.  I have heard others bring this same mantra of "composition is better than inheritance."  While it is true that you could typically use one approach against the other, they really best serve different purposes.  As a developer we need to be able to find the best tool for a given job.  It's the classic saying of "when your only tool is a hammer every problem starts to look like a nail."</p>
