message: "<p>As someone who tries to be a Software Engineer, I'm reminded of the old engineer's phrase: \"Good. Fast. Cheap. Pick at most two.\" Software Engineering is all about making engineering choices -- inheritance vs. composition, build vs. buy, Open vs. Closed Source, etc. Closing off your mind by always picking one alternative means closing off choices that might be better for your particular project (possibly your next project).</p>"
