message: <p>(In a world where search engine ordering defines currency, this is a happening conversation.)<br>For most junior programmers, blindly adhering to these patterns is likely to produce better designs than ignorance of them. If a junior programmer is doing design work, handing them a list of these pithy phrases and an example or two to demonstrate them is going to be very helpful.<br>Teaching junior programmers standards, such as design patterns, is a necessary first step in properly educating them. The wisdom to question patterns and to decide when *not* to use them comes with experience. But note the emphasis here on learning them as quasi-absolutes, aka “Best Practices”. <br>Learning “what to think about” is not a necessary first step in learning to think, but I think a lot of time is wasted when such guidance is missing.<br></p>
