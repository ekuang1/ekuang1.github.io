message: <p>It's amazing to me how many of us started out around 9 or 10 with a vic 20 or C-64 (as I did), or TRS-80.  For some time I thought I was the only one who remembered the C-64.<br>Saw your recent interview on Channel 9, glad to hear you're enjoying the Seattle area.  We are also moving up there at the end of the month from LA.  Can't wait for the cooler weather.</p>
