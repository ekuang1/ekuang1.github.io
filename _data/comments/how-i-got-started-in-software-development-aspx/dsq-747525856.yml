message: <p>Timex Sinclair 1000 in the early 80's here, so I must have been ten or eleven. It had a nice black and white, membrane keyboard, pluggable RAM expansion cartridge.  I think I even have some of the old games on cassette... things like tanks and frogger...  I learned BASIC on that thing, and then moved on to a Commodore 128 and a *gasp* floppy drive.  It was great.  Then a 286 or 386 I think.  I ran a nice ANSI BBS (Wildcat maybe) off that with a 1200bps modem.  And then I went to college and discovered BITNET, C, and MUDs.  It was all downhill from there.</p>
