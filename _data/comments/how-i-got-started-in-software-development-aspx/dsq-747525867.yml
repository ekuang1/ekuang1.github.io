message: <p>"I guess I got my first taste when I was around eight with my first computer, a TRS-80 Color Computer."<br>Wow, that is really once upon a time. So not all computer geeks are computer genius who started programming at 16 and made their names at 25. But you probably made your first programming gig before 25. <br>Should all people be banned if they did not know any programming before 25? <br>Enjoy your blog</p>
