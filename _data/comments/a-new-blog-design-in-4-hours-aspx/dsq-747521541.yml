message: <p>p.s. I saw those questionable claims too, but the Wikipedia article now has citations and confirmations (such as Guinness records) for many of his claims.<br>To be honest, even if some of his claims turn out to be exaggerated, I don't think it takes away from his main points. At the very least, his claim to writing a bestselling book cannot be disputed.</p>
