message: "<p>It certainly is a great looking skin. Kudos, indeed. <br>As someone who is not a 'coder' this post was a something of a revelation for me: Do I want work with my blog, or work <em>at</em> my blog?<br>subText is a great .net project- perhaps the best of it's breed. However, I was working way too hard trying to tool up to what wordpress can already do... and I realized that my _time_ could be better spent.  ~cheers</p>"
