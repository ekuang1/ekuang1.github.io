message: <p>Grats for the new layout. One complain from me too, though. Please, make something for the colours when painting with mouse. On main post the background colour changes to white and front stays the same which is bad because of the gradient from yellow to white. On the bottom of the post, you can't see what what you've painted! In comments there's the default dark blue background which is ok but not in line with the main post policy.</p>
