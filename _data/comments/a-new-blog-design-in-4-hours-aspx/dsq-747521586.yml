message: <p>I like the new design, it looks really nice (except link to comments should be at the bottom of the blog post, but you arent the only one who made this mistake!).<br>However, I am afraid I will have to totally agree with Mr. Strahl, this fixed width craze is overrated.  I have a 24" widescreen LCD and my resolution is pretty bloated.  Not that I enjoy moving my head back and forth horizontally when reading....  this is just way too narrow.</p>
