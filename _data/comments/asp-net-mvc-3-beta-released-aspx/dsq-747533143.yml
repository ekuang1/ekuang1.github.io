message: <p>One thing I would really like to see with MVC 3.0 is much more intuitive support for Multi-Select Drop Downs. I realize there are half a dozen to the other solutions out there, but it seems that no matter what, it always becomes a problem in any project I do. <br>I would really be excited to see the MVC team address this in the future. <br>One thing I haven't liked about MVC 3.0 is that a lot of the features that are being touted are very unclear. What I mean by that is that they assume a very specific level of knowledge in certain aspects of "MVC", such as Dependency Injection, and IoC. I realize that from a technical community standpoint, you cannot just 'dumb down' every post made, but I feel that a lot of blog posters do not keep in mind that MANY MANY MANY of the people 'getting into MVC programming', like myself, are very unfamiliar with these concepts and the way they are presented makes it hard to understand their significance. I know I spent a great deal of time reading through ScottGu's posts on MVC 3.0 and I find myself just saying "I have no idea what any of this means".<br>In any case, I love how MVC 3.0 is shaping up. Keep up the good work. In all the years I've been programming, I've never seen a project evolve as quickly, <strong>and as professionally</strong> as ASP.NET MVC. I feel like we have a team that wants to make this a champion. I feel like we have a team that wants this to be a standard. I feel like we have a team that isn't cutting corners to get things done. When the MVC team releases something, it feels concrete, it feels thought out, it feels like something I can be proud to say I am using.</p>
