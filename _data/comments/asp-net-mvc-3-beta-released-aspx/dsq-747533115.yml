message: <p>Phil, we need multiple views support in mvc, or a way to update multiple divs in one request like erx mentioned. This should have been in since v1 :).   Anyone else think this is important?<br>At the moment I am queuing my requests, div one updates and sends js request to update div2 so user sees delay... Still better than the js hack option.</p>
