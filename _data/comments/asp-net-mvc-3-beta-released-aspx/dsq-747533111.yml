message: <p>(I posted this on Brad's blog too - wanted your input also)<br>Any improvement in validation support?<br>1)  Need to set a range - dynamically.  Say you are transferring money out your bank account.  You click on the account you want to transfer from and I have a box to type in how much you want to transfer.   In the controller - I can look at your balance and need to be able to set the max value at that time.  It does me no good to use a static attribute.<br>2)  Out of the box support for remote validation.<br>3)  Put a from and to date field on a page.  Make sure the from is before the to.  Or have 3 or 4 date fields that are all related, say - date you are leaving on vacation, date you are returning, date you want to fly home.   (leave&lt;return, flyhome&gt;=leave and flyhome&lt;return)<br>4)  Model validation - validate the model after all fields have been validated - and some way to send a javascript version of this to the client.<br>Are there any plans for implementation of any of these scenarios.  I know I read there is some additional support for 'related field validation' in the preview (would it support option 3 above?).  What about the badly needed option 1 and 2?<br></p>
