message: <p>How do you add global namespace imports for razor views?  with aspx views namespaces added in the web config via the pages/namespaces setting were available.  With MVC 3 preview 1, razor views could see namespaces added programitically using Microsoft.WebPages.Compilation.CodeGeneratorSettings.AddGlobalImport("") -- It appears this method no longer is available.</p>
