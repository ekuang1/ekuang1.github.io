message: <p>I've been meaning to get used to using and learning how to use Github for a while now so I really appreciate this post. I do have a question, would this be a good way to test websites before actually launching them? For example, this guide ( http*githubmobiriseblog*blogspot*com* ) - what do you think about such web-builders with Git-supporting?</p>
