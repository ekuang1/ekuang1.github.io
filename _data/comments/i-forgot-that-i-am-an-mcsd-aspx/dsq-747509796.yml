message: <p>HAHAHAHA! What did you expect from getting an the MCSD? The world to be doffing its cap to you as you prance through the heather!?!?!<br>No. The qualification gets your foot in the door by showing you at least know something about the language and that you care enough the put down the Â£500 to take the exams. Thats all and thats fine enough.<br>Why you think its even remotely contrustive to compare the MCSD to the MCSE, I dont know. Two completely different things.<br>PhDs wont get you anywhere in the real world, now thats a real waste of time...</p>
