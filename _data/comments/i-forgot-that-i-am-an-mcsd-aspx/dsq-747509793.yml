message: "<p>Jayson: As a manager, I'd say nothing beats experience and just coming across as smart and as a problem solver in the interview.<br><br><br><br>I personally don't value a Comp Sci degree as much as many employees do.  In part, because I myself got a degree in Mathematics.  <br><br><br><br>Depending on the type of software development you do, I think a Comp Sci degree is no more relevant than a Math or Philosophy degree.  The reason I feel this way is that Computer Science as it is currently taught is largely focused on theory.  In the CS classes I took, I never once used source control.  Never even heard of it.  Not once did I gather requirements, document my work, etc...  Computer Science doesn't prepare students to become software engineers apart from the general skills one learns in any good school: problem solving, critical thinking, etc...<br><br><br><br>I know some schools are adding Software Engineering as its own discipline.  That would actually catch my attention when evaluating a candidate.</p>"
