message: <p>i'm in the same boat as you actually (obtained mine a while back as well)...what concerns me is that the MCSE certification carries much more weight than it's development counterpart, even though i've heard from many that the MCSD cert is harder to obtain (let the flames begin).  you mentioned some names in your post...well, those guys are all very well known devs (in the MS community at least), so yeah, they probably aren't too concerned about obtaining this certification...but for someone who is just starting out in the MS dev world (as i was a couple years back when i obtained the cert), i feel it can really make a candidate stand out in the sense that they are "trainable"; but if you look at the numbers, MCSE's outweigh MCSD's heavily, and i think you nailed it...MS promotes the MCSE more, plus there really isn't a 4 year degree aligned with _just_ system admin stuff, so programming positions are looking more for a comp-sci background rather than a cert.  that being said, i've never had an interview where my certs weren't brought up, and i definitely feel they gave me an edge over other candidates as they show a more specialized type of training on the Windows platform.  as the years have ticked by, the certs have meant less and less over plain experience.  caveat?  nothing beats a good ol' comp-sci degree and experience.</p>
