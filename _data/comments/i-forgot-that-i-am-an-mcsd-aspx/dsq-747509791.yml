message: <p>Ha ha... Well put Dimitri.  And I agree with you.  I am and hope to continue to be recognized for the quality of my work.<br><br><br><br>However, for smaller independent consulting firms that decide to become Microsoft Partners in order to stay viable, having that Gold certification may be helpful due to the benefits Microsoft provides to such partners.  Attaining Gold certification requires MS certification of a certain percentage of employees.<br><br><br><br>Also, consider a company who needs to hire a developer, but the company itself isn't very technical.  Perhaps they need a really really small technical staff.  <br><br><br><br>I think it's hard for them to evaluate potential employees so they are tempted to rely on certification as a baseline evaluation.  Now of course, I don't believe a  certification is a good indicator of a candidate's quality at all.  But I also think that the employer's focus on certification shouldn't automatically disqualify them from a candidate's list of potential employers, considering that the candidate may BECOME the tech department and help guide its future direction.</p>
