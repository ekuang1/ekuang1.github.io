message: <p>Certification-smertification. I never cared to get one, albeit I probably never needed one -- I haven't updated my resume in years. As long as you write good code, your peers will recognize and value your work. And if certification is a critical issue of employment eligibility, you probably don't want to work for that employer anyway.</p>
