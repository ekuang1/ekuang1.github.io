message: <p>I actually was one of the first 1000 that was MSCD certified.  Did it help me at all? HELL NO!  I refused to get recertified ever again.  The only people that it serves is the company you work for.   It's really only a cash cow for Microsoft.  <br><br><br><br>I found out very quickly that they never took it serious was when I went to Tech*Ed 97.  They were supposed to do something special for anyone who was a MCSD.  They were going to give a special pin that you could wear and show everyone you were certified.  Sort of cool but also lame at the same time because who really cares.  However, when I got to the registeration booth I thought they would give me the pin because I had told them during sign up that I was an MSCD.  Instead, they put out an OPEN bucket that ANYONE could take the pin and put it on.  What a joke!  I asked what was so special if everyone who found the bucket get a pin an wear it?  They looked at me like who really gives a rat's ass.<br><br><br><br></p>
