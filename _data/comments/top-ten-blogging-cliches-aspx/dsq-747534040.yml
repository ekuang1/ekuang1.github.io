message: <p>I swear like a fucking sailor.  But when it comes to blogs/other communication, I tend to use the *** as a matter of either <br>a) not getting SPAM filtered <br>b) I work in the big machine, some people get sensitive about it and call it "unprofessional" therefore hindering my career advancement.  That and I'm sick of HR calls.  ;)<br>I'm sure you're familar with the a philisophy of "Just fucking do it!"  If not, here's a link on mine with a slight opinion ;)<br><a href="http://yakshaver.blogspot.com/2010/05/do-it-fuking-now.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Yakshaving-YetAnothernetPerspective+%28YakShaving+-+Yet+Another+.NET+Perspective%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://yakshaver.blogspot.com/2010/05/do-it-fuking-now.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Yakshaving-YetAnothernetPerspective+%28YakShaving+-+Yet+Another+.NET+Perspective%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">yakshaver.blogspot.com/.../do-it-fuking-now.html</a><br>Good shit though.</p>
