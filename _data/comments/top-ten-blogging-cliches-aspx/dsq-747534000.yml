message: <p>You should add "Future Predictions of the New Year" to your list of overplayed cliches in blogging. These just waste more bandwidth and pollute Google with results that are not relavent to what you're searching for because what the post mentions is not real. I don't know how many times I've seen it predicted that "This year will be the year of the Linux desktop." Face it, when Linux is ready for broad consumer adoption on the desktop, there wont be anymore desktops.</p>
