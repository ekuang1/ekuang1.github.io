message: <p>Another cliche is that one should blog to promote one's business. <br>This is in every online marketing guide. What's amazing is that the blanket recommendation takes no account of the time and effort involved. <br>Surely it makes sense for some, say, those whose trade is largely dependent on online publishing or communication of ideas. For others, electricians, restaurants, etc this makes no sense, except as a hobby.</p>
