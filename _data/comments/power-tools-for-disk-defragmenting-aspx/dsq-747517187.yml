message: <p>I've got to agree with James and Braden... Diskeepr has been in charge of my HDDs for the past couple of years  and I love. <br>Since configuring a custom "Set It and Forget It" defrag schedule, I've not had to manually defrag a single time.<br>One thing to note tho... if you plan to run Diskeeper on your Win Servers, you'll need to pony up for the Server edition.</p>
