message: <p>Great post.<br>Do you need to create a HTTP module for this?  <br>As your MVC application implements System.Web.HttpApplication you could wire all this up on the application_start and add the event handlers for the events required in the application class.<br>This might not be as tidy or reusable but for a single web app its probably less scary for folk who want to avoid HTTP Handlers.</p>
