message: <p>I had successfully implemented the above IHttpModule in my web application and tested it on IIS 7.5 which I use for staging on my computer. It all worked well and so I deployed my web application on live hosting server. But, somehow on live server, the unauthenticated ajax-requests, forced browser to trigger windows/basic/digest authentication on the browser. Since I was using only Forms authentication in my web app, I was confused as to why the browser presented such "authentication required" popups, before running the ajax error handler (which redirects to forms login page). Later, I noticed that IIS adds "WWW-Authenticate" headers for a 401 request, so such 401 responses trigger the "Authentication Required" popup in browser before even running the ajax error handler for the ajax request. The only solution seems to me is to disable the Basic, Digest and Windows Authentication at web application level in IIS. This problem did not occurred on my staging server as Basic, Digest and Windows authentication modes were disabled for the web application. <br>Any better suggestions to tackle the problem that I am facing ?<br>regards,<br>Nirvan</p>
