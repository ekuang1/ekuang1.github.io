message: "<p>Thanks. Here's what I found. You can induce a 401, while retaining FormsAuthentication, by creating an /Account/Login path that can never be authorized.<br>   [Authorize]<br>    public class AccountController : Controller<br>    {        <br>        [Authorize(Roles = \"NonExistentRole\")] <br>        public ActionResult Login(string returnUrl)<br>        {<br>            return View();<br>        }<br>    }<br>Would there be any issues with this (apart from having a role called \"NonExistentRole\") ?<br></p>"
