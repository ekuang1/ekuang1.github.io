message: <p>Wouldn't it make more sense to have this be handled by a different HttpModule based on the url's extension.<br>In Rails, if the URL has no extension, it's supposed to be a browser call, where you might respond with a redirect.<br>If the URL has a .json extension, you get a plain error, not a redirect.</p>
