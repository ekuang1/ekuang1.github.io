message: <p>Hi, I was trying to extend this logic to apply to requests for unauthorized static content (Say, some static content protected by denying unauthentication users access to the location of a static resource in web.config). But I see that the request is not available to my http module beyond the PostAuthenticate application event in the pipeline. In fiddler it somehow shows up with a 302 status. My configuration is as follows:Â runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true" and there is no proecondition of managed handler for my module. Any help to find a solution to my problem is greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thanks.<br>A</p>
