message: <p>Well here's my take on it. If it truly provides feature parity. In other words, from the outside I can't tell the difference. Does it matter? It's like the turing test of source control emulation. ;)<br>If it does have parity, then I think that's pretty sweet. Though it leaves me wondering how they plan to keep up parity with new Subversion releases.</p>
