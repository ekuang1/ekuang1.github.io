message: <p>I wonder why all of the Open Source code repositories suck in one way or another.  I am waiting for one of the major sites to finally see that what projects need is a complete package.  One with a decent integrated VCS, Item Tracking, Forums, Wiki, and maybe even a nice blog.  Oh and you should be able to get a sh*tload of metrics on every aspect of the project.  It is almost as if they only want you to store your code on their servers but keep all of your other project stuff somewhere else. <br>Finally, the site should not look like it was built by a bunch of blind 5th graders with no design skills.  I mean really - how much would it cost SourceForge to pay a designer to make the site look like it was actually built sometime in the last decade.  Everytime I go there I keep expecting to see blinking or scrolling text telling me about the current project of the month.<br>While we're at it, how about actually making it easy to search for and find projects.  Give me some rich search tools that actually understand that I am looking for projects that meet a certain criteria.  I don't code in PHP and could care less that you have 500 projects written in PHP that also happen to use my search term. Oh what about all those C, Perl, Haskell, Java, Ruby (ok maybe I'm interested) or python projects.  Just show me the friggin .Net projects that are about "X". Oh and make sure that someone has actually worked on those projects sometime in the last century.<br>Is this asking for too much?</p>
