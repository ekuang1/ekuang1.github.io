message: <p>@Joe - <a href="http://Koders.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Koders.com">Koders.com</a> does a pretty decent job of searching SourceForge. The problem is that SF doesn't provide any sort of project feed that I know of, so we have to rely on people submitting projects to koders or crawling.</p>
