message: <p>@Phil - I was talking more about a search based on various pieces of project meta-data.  Whether it is project activity, keyword, language, last check-in, etc.  All of the data exists in the db, it is just that in many cases the sites don't expose a form that allows for this level of search.  SourceForge has one of the best, but there are still basic searches that I cannot do.  For example, go to any repository and try to find a BSD, C# project with a release in the last 6 months using the keyword of your choice.  What good is a repository of 100,000 OS projects if you cannot do any meaningful searches.  I have not used Koders enough to be able to comment on all its features, but it is not at all obvious that I could answer the above question.  To me this is a feature that the repository should provide. <br>Sharpforge looks like it is a good start for a repository.  Unfortunately it is not setup to actually scale for the 1000s or 100s of thousands of projects like a SourceForge or CodePlex.  I am not sure how well their code will scale when you have users hitting forums across 1000 different projects.  But definitely something to keep in mind and watch.</p>
