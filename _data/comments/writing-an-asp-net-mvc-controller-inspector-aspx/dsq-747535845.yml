message: <p>Phil what we need are tools that help us to find controllers that are throwing 404 errors and MOST importantly will give us a checklist of things to try to fix it. I have a app right now where one bad route broke routing for the entire application, had to spend hours and hours to learn that you need to add views as embedded resources because its a large multi-project mvc app where there is only one area defined, and now I have a controller that is returning 404 and the spelling, inheriting form Controller and implementing the IController interface all appear to be correct. The most critical thing is to expose the reasons  for and solutions to the extremely brittle routing engine that throws lots of 404's errors for routes,controllers and views but give developers EXTREMELY unhelpful error messages and no suggestions on how to fix the errors that it reports. The developer experience for MVC routing needs desperate attention and it isn't fully baked yet. There is a reason devs are still insisting on sticking to <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> 4.</p>
