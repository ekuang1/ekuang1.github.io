message: <p>A couple of points:<br>1. I am very grateful for the talented folks who create open source projects and even the people who may disagree with an approach, or are upset because something didn't install correctly, etc., need to recognize the tremendous personal sacrifice it takes to support open source.<br>2.  There is plenty of room for spirited discussions provided the intention is good.<br>3.  Community members need to come to the aid and help 'discipline' anyone who really crosses the line.</p>
