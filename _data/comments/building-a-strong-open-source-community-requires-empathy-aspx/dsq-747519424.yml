message: <p>KUDOS PHIL! <br>I was really mad when another project's dev came over to my project (<a href="http://codeplex.com/clubstarterkit" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://codeplex.com/clubstarterkit">Club Starter Kit</a>) and started saying </p><blockquote> "Why are you doing this? This is pointless! Use SharePoint." </blockquote><p> <br>So I decided to delete it... maybe I shouldn't have. Oh well.<br>Anyways... I love SubText... keep up the good work!</p>
