message: <p>Great points, though I think they apply whether you are working on an open source project or not.  Anytime a developer is interacting with their users or anyone in the public, they need to take these into account.  Even with commercial products, you can get livid or toxic users who can be taxing on patience or dig under your skin.  In the end, need to realize which things to take with a grain of salt or to sift through and find what is constructive.</p>
