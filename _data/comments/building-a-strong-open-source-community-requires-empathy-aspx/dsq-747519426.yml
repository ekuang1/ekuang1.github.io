message: <p>Thanks Zack!<br>A legitimate question would have been, "Why not use Sharepoint for this? What advantage does this project have over using Sharepoint?"<br>Coming in and declaring the project pointless without waiting for the answer to his question is the height of arrogance. It's no wonder you deleted it. :)</p>
