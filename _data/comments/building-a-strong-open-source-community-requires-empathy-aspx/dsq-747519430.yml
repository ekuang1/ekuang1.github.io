message: <p><strong>@Rob:</strong> Where did you post <em>Open Source Challenges</em> go? It showed up in my RSS aggregator and when I went to leave a smart-ass comment on your blog the post was M.I.A. <br><strong>@Phil:</strong> Buddy, I'm glad that you had an opportunity to reply to that thread before I did b/c I might have 'disciplined' the poster (as <strong>Geri</strong> suggests)... I was all fired up about not being able to post a quip on Rob's blog b/c he was being a jerk - removing posts and whatnot!<br><strong>@everyone:</strong> You should be more like <em>foo</em> and start doing <em>bar</em>. I'm so freaking sick of <em>baz</em>... you suck!</p>
