message: <p>To me there's a strong difference between a thoughtful review/rebuke/suggestion/rant and someone who's just out to rile people up (trolling). When you get someone, like the person in your thread, who writes things like "There, now I made people really angry" you have to scratch your head. I realize he apologized, but I think he should have had a time out in the corner (or like I suggested, to just "go away").<br>I don't think there's a problem telling someone you're going to ignore them unless they exhibit some professionalism.</p>
