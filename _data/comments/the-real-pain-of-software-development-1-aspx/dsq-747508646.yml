message: <p>RSI from typing blows. It's ruined my programming career, I got it from a crappy desk that was too high and rubbed my arms all the time, now my right wrist has been hurting for almost 9 months. Ibuprofen really doesn't do anything, but massages and ice are amazing, I just started that recently and I've seen a lot of improvement, not cured yet, but hopefully. Let this be a lesson to every programmer who codes too hard.</p>
