message: "<p>1st, at 42.5 my spine is S-ish and my torso rotated, both towards the mouse.  It was so bad that one of my ribs no longer properly joined to the spinal column which caused sometimes intense pain at *random* points along the rib.  Started sitting on an exercise ball and the pain was gone in two days.  Unless you've got Herman Miller money, get a ball.<br>2nd, my fingers were feeling it due to mushy keyboards.  Got a Leopold 10keyless with Cherry Browns and its *super*.  Every cm your arm has to travel towards the mouse is that much more strain on the shoulder, yo!<br>3rd, get yourself some mouse buttons.  Microsoft Intellimouse 4.0 with 3 programmable buttons:<br>   big thumb : double click; <br>   lil thumb : back<br>   wheel but : forward<br>4th, master AutoHotkey; I've only begun, but CTL-ALT-F12 has been resizing and replacing all manner of console windows and now CTL-v actually pastes to console windows (cmd.exe, fsi.exe, ...)<br>Unfortunately, with Windows, there's approximately 5K more steps to ergo-heaven.  I'll keep all y'all posted if I solve it :-)<br>Lasting peace and happiness for *ALL* human beings!<br>Robert W. McCall<br></p>"
