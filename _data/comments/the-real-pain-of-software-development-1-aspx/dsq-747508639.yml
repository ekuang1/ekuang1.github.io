message: <p>I had terribly painful tendonitis in my wrists and hands from using the computer a few years ago.  I went to see a doctor who prescribed a lot of ibuprofen and I also saw a physical therapist who tried all sorts of stuff.  Neither of them were able to make much of a difference in my condition.  Then I tried simply icing my wrists and hands for about 10-15 minutes each night in bed and, after several weeks, I was 100% cured.  I've had some pain start come back several times since then, but a couple nights of icing has fixed it every time.<br><br><br><br>Switching to a thumb-operated trackball (Logitech) instead of a mouse helped somewhat, too.<br><br><br><br>Good luck getting better, I know how frustrating RSI can be.</p>
