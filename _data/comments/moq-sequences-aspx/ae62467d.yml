  With the new version of Mock you can now use SetupSequence:

  // taken from: https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart#miscellaneous



  var mock = new Mock<IFoo>();

  mock.SetupSequence(f => f.GetCount())

      .Returns(3)  // will be returned on 1st invocation

      .Returns(2)  // will be returned on 2nd invocation

      .Returns(1)  // will be returned on 3rd invocation

      .Returns(0)  // will be returned on 4th invocation



  I thought I should post this because this was one of the top google search results which at the time was a nice solution to mocking sequential method calls :)
