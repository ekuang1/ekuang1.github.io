message: "<p>@Trystan: Look at the date of my blog post, I'm pretty sure <code>SetupSequence</code> came after! According to the commit, it was <a href=\"https://github.com/Moq/moq4/commit/50341025c65c6190005a9d6ff6cad005cbb4e83e\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://github.com/Moq/moq4/commit/50341025c65c6190005a9d6ff6cad005cbb4e83e\">added two years ago</a>. I should update my post though as I hadn't realized they added it!</p>"
