message: <p>Enterprises are killing ASP.NET Webforms over MVC 3 and the upcoming 4 argument by merging it with HTML 5 specification. Lack of knowledge from people and sheer media and tech news are driving the technology decisions, unfortunate but bitter truth.<br>They both have their own advantages and disadvantages, no doubt, but to an extent that, oh Webforms - hmm won't be there kind of arguments makes the management scared. Any update you can provide on your view now since MVC 3 is out and 4 is on horizon will really benefit the enterprise architect idiots to make such statements.<br>Thanks,<br></p>
