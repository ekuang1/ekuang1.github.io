message: <p>Since this is the top Google hit for "future of <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a>",<br>and we've since seen MVC reach and pass(?) adolescence;<br>it would be interesting and very helpful to get an update of the situation.<br>Have ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC become so entwined, that your post still stands as truth?<br>Is there any statistics of use you can make available?<br>I think many would benefit, as there is still a lot of ASP.NET sites being met by new developers, and the discussion of whether to migrate or not is rampant across the globe, methinks.<br>Thanks!</p>
