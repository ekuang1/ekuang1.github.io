message: "<p>I personally love ASP.NET WebForms coz have been working with WebForms for about 5 years now. However, the MVC framework is great for test driven development and many developers can work together much better organized.<br>I like both frameworks and personally, I still love more WebForms than MVC, even though I've already started developing MVC apps regularly almost few months now.<br>I think the problem with the MVC is that many juniors get 'scared' once they start learning about it. It has a lot of new things, new terms and one thing which applies for everyone: 'Developers often need to have completely freedom on the way of how to organize their logic from the ZERO level, I found that some of the developers don't like it because they feel that they have to follow rules which exists only in the MVC framework for web development' - Anyway, I think once get used to work with the way of how its organized, everyone will like it :).</p>"
