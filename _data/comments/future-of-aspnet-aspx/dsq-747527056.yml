message: '<p>WebForms were great in 2003-2005, but since then ASP.NET has constantly disappointed: UIPAB (MVP) was a configuration exercise, ASP.NET Themes &amp; Skins were out of line with the rest of the web community (CSS), ASP.NET AJAX attempted to drag the WebForm baggage into JavaScript, and 3rd Party controls were more trouble then their cost. <br>The word on the street is that WebForms are for "kiddies". :)<br>Keep up the great work MVC team! Hurray for MVC!<br></p>'
