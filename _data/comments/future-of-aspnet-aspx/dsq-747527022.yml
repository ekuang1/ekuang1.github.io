message: <p>Hey Phil, this is all good news. It's great to hear that as the toolset from MS grows, so does the sharing between those tools. I think MVC is part of a natural evolution and has its place in our world, just as webforms do. <br>I remember the good old classic ASP days, and they weren't as bad as everyone makes them out to be. MVC leans towards those lighter, "cleaner" front ends and the all-important TDD factor can not be ignored. I agree 100% with Mark that webforms are wonderful too and have empowered people to do amazing things in even more amazing timeframes. <br>All in all, I think that Microsoft is heading the right direction and as these toolsets evolve we will benefit across the board because the people driving things forward at MS have such fantastic vision.<br>Great news all round.</p>
