message: '<p>I can proudly say I took one look at webforms all those years ago and dismissed them within an hour or so. They were so obviously unsuited to the flexibility of the web.<br> ... and the horror code I have split my sides looking at: people writing pages of garbage simply to get back to default html/http behaviour! ... jscript event links replacing <a> , and  revealing completely wrong customer account details regularly, and noone knowing why, and the whole site navigation wrapped up in the mess.<br></a></p>'
