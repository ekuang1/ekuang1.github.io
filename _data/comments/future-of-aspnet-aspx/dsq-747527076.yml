message: <p>Well, listen to the purists rant.  Hmmm.. Most of what I've seen with Java and asp is primitive and crude compared to the power and sophistication of a telerik web grid.  So basically, I'm hearing the argument that Web Forms are not elegant enough or fast enough or scalable enough.  But I am not going to try to explain to my customer why my team is still jacking around with html and css and spending thousands of their money hand crafting spinning logos.. The reality is that the world is coded by the 30 -40/ year script kiddies.. wake up brothers.. MVC is a time warp to ASP and javascript..</p>
