message: <p>I love webforms ...MVC is good in certain aspects and cases.But u must have some solid reasons to drop something in favour of something else.I dont see any reasons.Enterprise level(n tier) apps were made successfully before MVC came and people were happy wid the results....I see no reson to switch to something new when u already have something which u are happy with.MVC is big timewaster in terms of htmlcode and codebehind  being together and it looks ugly as well....long live webforms!</p>
