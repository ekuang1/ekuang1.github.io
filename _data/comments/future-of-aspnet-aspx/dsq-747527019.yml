message: <p>While it's nice to see that Web Forms will enjoy continued support (which I believe they should), the thing I love about MVC is its inherent ability to work within a TDD framework.  It promotes Behavior-Driven Design, which Web Forms just doesn't do.<br>Keep up the great work and thanks for reminding everyone that just because it's the new hotness doesn't mean that Web Forms is entirely the old busted joint.</p>
