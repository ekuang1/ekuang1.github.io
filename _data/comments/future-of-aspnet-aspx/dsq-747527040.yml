message: <p>From my point of view I see ASP.NET WebForms and Dynamic Data to be the RAD platform, competing with platform-as-a-service type offerings from Salesforce and Oracle. ASP.NET MVC becomes the testable enterprise and Web 2.0 style platform, for more agile AJAX apps. I see those as totally complementary to one another.</p>
