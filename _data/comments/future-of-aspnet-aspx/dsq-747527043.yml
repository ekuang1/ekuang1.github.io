message: <p>I never really liked Web Forms from the get go, because the model of WinForms beaten into the Web never really sat well with me.  The real death-knell though was  the first time in VS2003 that I couldn't open a web form in design mode any more.  No real reason, just VS refused to open it.  I had only ever edited it in Design Mode, never hacked by hand in VS or anywhere else.  So since i could no longer edit the page, there's no way any one who's still sane can work with all that asp:stuff by hand, I had to rip out all the web forms stuff and replace it with plain HTML.  Took a little work to re-do the code behind stuff that connected it, but I've never looked back.  I've never had an aspx that's just plain HTML fail to open in any editor, even VS :P.  About 2 years ago I moved to Monorail and thought to myself "This makes building .NET web apps fun again."  Maybe if I had problems getting Monorail in the door I might look at ASP.NET MVC, but for now, it's too late to the game, and gives me no real reasons to move off Monorail.  If MS hadn't wasted several years trying to cram Web Forms down people's throats they could have been quicker to the game with MVC and maybe had a chance of getting people like me on board.</p>
