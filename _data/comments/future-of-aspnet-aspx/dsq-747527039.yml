message: <p>I use WebForms and I like them. I use some commercial controls too. I read about MVC and noticed it doesn't support server controls like the gridview. It expects me to use a foreach loop instead of using a repeater? I don't want to spend time hand coding html. <br>I am not quite ready to throw away all the controls I have been using so far. I will wait till v2.0 comes out where it has support to more controls and be more mature. There's too many other technologies to learn.<br></p>
