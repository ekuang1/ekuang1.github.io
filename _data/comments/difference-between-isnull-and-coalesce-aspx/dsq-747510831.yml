message: <p>Very interesting.  Personally I'd never heard of the coalesce keyword until reading this post (had to run to BOL to check it out).  isnull truncates the replacement value to the size of the expression being checked whereas coalesce does not?  Interesting behavior, and not at all what I expected.  Good post.</p>
