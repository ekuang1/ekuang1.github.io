message: <p>Thank you for an interesting idea. My wife gets frustrated with me because I do tend to follow a similar "squeaky wheel" model around the house. I don't consider myself very handy, so I don't really work very hard at solving it either. However, this could be a very interesting idea which would help me get on top of things and make her happy because I'm paying attention to those details.</p>
