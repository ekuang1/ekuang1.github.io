message: <p>I wanted something that wasn't yet another place to go to. I already integrated GitHub into my workflow. I also wanted something that had a website and native apps. At the time, GitHub had an Issues app that worked nicely. We've since pulled that down, but the mobile view for issues is pretty decent.</p>
