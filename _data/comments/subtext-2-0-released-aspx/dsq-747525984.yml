message: <p>i've tried to upgrade from 1.9.3 to 2.0.0 and got stuck with message "... is curently upgrading... if you are a host admin click here..." and when I click, I am redirected to same page again. would it be better to do a new install? in that case I need to find a way to copy all data from my old install to new one. I am on shared hosting on <a href="http://qsh.eu" rel="nofollow noopener" title="qsh.eu">qsh.eu</a></p>
