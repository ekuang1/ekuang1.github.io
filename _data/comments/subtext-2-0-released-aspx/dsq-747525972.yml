message: <p>Congratulations on the release - excited to check it out.<br>For previous versions of SubText, the recommended first step for getting on board with development was submitting bugfixes or tests.  With the move to MVC, what would you recommend as first steps for someone interested in  helping out on that, given that not necessarily all of what's out there now will be moving forward?</p>
