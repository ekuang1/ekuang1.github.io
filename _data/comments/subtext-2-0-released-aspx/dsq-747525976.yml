message: <p>Thanks for the new release. Already installed and using happily. :)<br>I think it will be a good time to ask , whether you are able to plan future roadmap(i love this words:) of subtext or not ? <br>After I saw the easiness of Subtext installation , I would like to see a ASP.NET CMS in a similar way. Do you have suggestions what should I use as a CMS ? <br>Thank you very much! Please let me know if anything I can help / contribute / carry . (btw  my native language is Turkish , may be a language translation ?  )</p>
