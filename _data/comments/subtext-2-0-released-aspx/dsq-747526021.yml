message: <p>I tried to upgrade from 1.9.5 to 2.0 right after launch with no success.  The problem seemed to stem from my blog being hosted on a shared environment (webhost4life).  Has anyone had success in upgrading on a shared environment?  If so, can you provide steps in overcoming any issues?  I'd appreciate any tips you have.  Thanks!</p>
