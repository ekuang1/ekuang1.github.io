message: <p>I have dragon's problem:<br>&gt;&gt; i've tried to upgrade from 1.9.3 to 2.0.0 and got stuck with message "... is curently upgrading... if you are a host admin click here..." and when I click, I am redirected to same page again. <br>However, before I got to that problem, I had several element deletes I had to do to the web.config related do duplicate entries that seemed to be due to Ajax 1.0 according to the comments. After several attempts of deleteing lines, I finally got to the "...is currently upgrading..." page.<br>I downloaded the manual scripts but am not sure how or which to run. I am upgrading from 1.9.5 to 2.0.<br>I am using IIS7 and SQL 2008.<br>I first tried using Installation 2.0 which got errors like this:<br>The specified schema name "&lt;dbuser,varchar,dbo&gt;" either does not exist or you do not have permission to use it.<br>I looked at some tables and the TABLE_SCHEMA column had 'dbo' and not '&lt;dbuser,varchar,dbo&gt;' as some of your statements are looking for. <br>I had upgraded SubText a few times before up to my current 1.9.5.<br>How can I fix this?<br>Thanks,<br>Gary Davis<br></p>
