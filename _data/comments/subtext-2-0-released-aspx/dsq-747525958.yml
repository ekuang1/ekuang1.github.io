message: <p>I know the people doing some stuff with DasBlog briefly discussed the possibility of doing a rewrite in ASP.NET MVC.  Would it be at all worthwhile (this is dangerous territory I'm treading in, I'm sure) to perhaps make a Subtext/Dasblog "one blog to rule them all" codebase between the two?<br>Just an idle thought...<br></p>
