message: <p>Are you people kidding me?<br>.NET open source applications aren't open source because... what?  <br>You can't debug the kernel so that makes the software I've written and the code I've left open to you what?  Less open source?  <br>That has to be the most retarded argument I've heard in a LONG time.  Get over yourselves and your "MS is evil" paranoia.<br></p>
