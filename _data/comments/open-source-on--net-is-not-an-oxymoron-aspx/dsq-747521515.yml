message: <p>&gt;&gt; Whereas with licenses such as the new BSD or MIT license, the freedom of the user of the code is paramount.  &lt;&lt;<br>To be clear, the BSD/MIT types of licenses gives the *developer-as-user* who is incorporating the code into new software maximum freedom.  However, the GPL is designed to give the *end-user* of the software maximum freedom.  It is specifically designed so that end-users would not be locked of of being able to do what they may want or need to do with the software.<br>The BSD/MIT type of license gives similar freedoms to developers who use the code, but not necessarily to the end-users.<br>I think this is why many developers do not like software with a GPL license - the license is not intended to benefit them so much as it's intended to benefit end-users.<br>(Note - I'm not saying one is better than the other, just pointing out who get seems to get 'maximum' benefit from the licenses).</p>
