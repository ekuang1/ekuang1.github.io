message: <p>OK, that's it. The "bank error" in your favor has officially kicked in :) I think OSS built on the Windows stack cannot be entirely compared to one on a complete OSS stack. At least not in the "purity" aspect, in case anyone cares about it. If I weren't myself a .Net developer, I'd propose the term Dirty Source - not 100% pure OSS, but enough to entice your inner opportunistic quest for "free stuff". Let's face it, most people use open source for the monetary aspect (or lack thereof) of it. And there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
