message: <p>As an end user or even an OS developer why should I care if my database or my IDE or operating system is OS?  That is kinda like walking down the street, finding a $5 bill on the ground and saying "If only my wallet was free, then I could put this money inside."  The software has value regardless of the cost of rest of the stack it is used with.<br>I believe the people who see LAMP based OS projects as the only "real" OS projects tend to have this mentality that Open Source is somehow equated with "free software", where others, like myself, fall in the Open Source is about access to the code and the sharing of knowledge.  This is a classic dichotomy that has existed for the last 10 years (<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html">See Goodbye, "free software"; Hello, "open source"</a>) and which is just more apparent in the MS world.</p>
