message: <p>Open source for 99% of the people using it, at least an entirely open stack, is kind of like putting on anti-closet monster spray before going to bed when you're a kid. You aren't really going to need it but it might make you feel better.<br>How many people are there in the world that really understand the Linux kernel? How many are there that could understand the Windows kernel? Yeah, you can submit patches to Linux or Apache, but it takes about as long for your patch to get reviewed and put in the product as it does for a Windows developer.<br>But I do believe that if the entire stack isn't open, then the product isn't really Open Source. It's Open Source with an asterisk. But I'm OK with that. it's as open as I need it to be.<br>That being said. Most .NET Open Source are bizarre animals. The projects are based around custom build files and poorly documented install instructions. Multiple levels of assumptions. If your project doesn't support a "click on the .sln file and hit build" kind of ease of use, it won't get much in the way of contribution.</p>
