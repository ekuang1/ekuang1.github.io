message: <p>It's not that I do this to myself, it's that nearly every work environment I've worked at uses Windows. My current employer uses Windows, Linux, ASP.NET, Ruby, and PHP.<br>Wouldn't it suck if the only platforms for which I had great OSS tools available was Linuk, RUby, and PHP and nothing for Windows and ASP.NET?<br>I want to be productive at work so I can get home to my family and good OSS tools help me do that. What's so wrong about wanting these tools for every platform I have to work on? You might say convince my work to switch or only work for companies that don't use Windows, but that's unrealistic.<br>As I posted in a comment regarding this post on <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/info/234yr/comments" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Vote!">programming.reddit.com</a>...<br></p><blockquote><p>It's a bit like freedom in China. You could leave China because the govt doesn't support it. Or you can hope it catches on and starts to spread.</p></blockquote>
