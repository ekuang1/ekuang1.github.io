message: <p>I think a lot of people forget something very obvious about Open Source.  Open source software is running on proprietary hardware.  Almost every single time.  Your entire "stack" is not open until your hardware is open.  So until I have an open source computer running, my software will never be running on a completely open system.  It will only be running on different levels of open.  And that's fine.<br>So if I write open source software for Microsoft's operating systems, using .NET, it's still worth your time!  To say it's not good to bring open source to the windows platform is like saying it's not good to bring food to the starving.  Ok, that was a bit dramatic of a comparison, but you get the idea.</p>
