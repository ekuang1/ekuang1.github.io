message: <p>The argument against OSS on .NET is that you'll never get a shining recommendation from MS to use your framework, application, or platform if it is Open Source.  At least not the way you would get Sun's blessing if you chose Java.<br>Boo f-ing hoo.  Since when does MS give a shining recommendation to anything that they didn't create themselves?  Even commercial frameworks and apps on the .NET platform rarely get official commendation from Redmond.<br>The only way MS will ever recognize an OSS effort is to copy it with a commercial product.  I think thats the ultimate mark of success with an OSS .NET project :)</p>
