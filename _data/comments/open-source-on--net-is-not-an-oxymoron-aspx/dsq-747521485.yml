message: <p>The one part of the stack that I would like to see is a viable open source alternative to visual studio. Sharp Develop and MonoDevelop just don't cut it. With the c# language being a standard, and with alternative libraries (Mono.*), there is the huge potential for and complete open stack that would be very compatible with your vacation view.</p>
