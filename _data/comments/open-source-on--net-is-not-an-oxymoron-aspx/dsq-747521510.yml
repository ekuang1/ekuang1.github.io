message: <p>"Microsoft has been actively promoting DotNetNuke for the past 4 years."<br>I think that's only because they could verify the pedigree. DNN started out from the iBuySpy portal if I'm not mistaken. Which was a demo site built in ASP.NET 1.0 by a MS vendor. So effectively, MS started and sponsored DNN from the start.</p>
