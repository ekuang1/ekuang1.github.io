All the large open source projects are produced primarily by people paid to do so, either full-time or as part of their ongoing employment.<br>Take the canonical example - Linux kernel, Apache, MySql, PHP. Two of these are produced by single companies. The other two are largely produced by a network of paid employees across a number of companies.<br><br></p>
