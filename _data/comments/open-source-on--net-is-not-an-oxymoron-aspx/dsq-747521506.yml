message: <p>Hey, it's your problem, not mine.<br>And considering the fact that Microsoft will support and encourage you no matter what and never attempt to undermine the entire concept of open source, I can't imagine why anyone would question open source on Windows.<br>But if you want to write code that's exploitable by others for their own advantage and don't want to be paid, that's entirely your right, and you should be encouraged to donate free work to companies that can profit from it.  :)</p>
