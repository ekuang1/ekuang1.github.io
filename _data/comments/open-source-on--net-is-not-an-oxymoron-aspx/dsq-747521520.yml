message: <p>I develop proprietary software for a small company with an even smaller budget. I use the freely available Visual Web Developer Express &amp; can't afford expensive proprietary toolkits &amp; libraries. So I'm in the funny situation of actually <strong>relying</strong> on a lot of open source software to build proprietary products! Needless to say I strongly dislike the GPL.</p>
