message: <p>It is amazing how much misinformation people are willing to post.<br>"you'll never get a shining recommendation from MS to use your framework, application, or platform if it is Open Source" - Ohh really?  Microsoft has been actively promoting DotNetNuke for the past 4 years.  We have been a part of the Shared Hosting program with Microsoft for three of those years which means that our software is promoted to hosters as a low cost Windows .Net based alternative to packages like Joomla or PHP-Nuke.  We have more than a dozen individuals who have been made MVPs as a result of our work on DotNetNuke and we have been promoted from Microsoft's own ASP.Net website for the last 4 years.<br>"At least not the way you would get Sun's blessing if you chose Java."<br>This is great.  I better go tell Marc Fluery that all those years of battling Sun over the J2EE certification was just Sun's way of showing they cared.  Or maybe the guys on Eclipse didn't realize that Sun cared so much when Sun tried to kill off Eclipse and the SWT. Ohh...and the Linux guys... Yeah I bet they really felt the love from the Solaris group at Sun.<br>It is also amazing how much people claim to hate VS, yet in the Java OS camp they have spent the last several years trying to come up with a decent alternative to VS.  For years all I read about was how much better VS was than anything else.  After IBM spent millions of dollars and went through several different shitty IDEs, they finally succeeded with Eclipse, but other than that you cannot point to another successful IDE in the Open Source world that compares with VS.  NetBeans is cr@p.  BEA's couldn't even give their IDE away.<br>You can talk about how great Python and Perl and PHP and Ruby are, but how come we almost never hear about the tools used to code in those languages?</p>
