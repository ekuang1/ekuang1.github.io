message: <p>Okay, I am cool with your feelings on the software stack not being entirely Free. Those are your feelings, and though I disagree, it can make sense.<br>Where you really start to bug me, though, is where you talk about the stack stopping at the software aspect. You pose the question, "why doesn't proprietary hardware taint the openness of the stack with so-called 'all-or-nothing' people?"<br>If you understood anything about FOSS, you would realize that, since the beginning of the Free Software Movement, we have been perfectly fine with hardware, proprietary or not. Guess how much it costs to reproduce software. Now guess how much it costs to reproduce a hard disk. They deserve compensation for the production of the hardware, and Free Software advocates have always said that.<br>The only thing we have ever had a problem with is closed drivers that run the hardware, as that instantly makes it unusable in a Free system. As long as the drivers are free, then closed hardware is peachy.<br>If you want to understand more about the FOSS movement, I suggest you read some books and/or papers on the subject before you make us look like we're hypocrites.</p>
