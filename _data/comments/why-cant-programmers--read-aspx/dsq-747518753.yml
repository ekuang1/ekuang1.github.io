message: "<p>@Ryan: Heh heh. Well the thing I try and remind people is that risk management doesn't mean you can prevent the risk. It only means that you are aware of the risk, are working to reduce the risk, and hopefully have a contingency if the worst happens.<br>Even with clear acceptance criteria, SOW, etc... There's always the risk of miscommunication with a client.</p>"
