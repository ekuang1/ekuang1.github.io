message: <p>Interesting...I've been typing up a post on what I consider healthy developer attributes but haven't published it yet.<br>I've worked with guys in the past who were phenomenal coders, but had to be micromanaged to the point of insanity and were guilty of just what you pointed out...inability to read, or in most cases, <b>not reading between the lines</b> i.e. validating input, or including exception handling, or logging, etc.<br>Then there are guys (and I fall into this category) who are average coders, but are sticklers for getting things right the first time, and also take the time to ask lots of questions if they aren't sure about something. It also amazes me how many so called developers turn their machines off at 5pm, and don't turn them back on until the next workday. For them, it's just another gig. Passion scores more points for folks I interview than just about anything else.</p>
