message: "<p>Manager: What is your estimation for solving the FizzBuzz problem? <br>Programmer: Hmmm... 30 minutes with automated build, unit test, and everything.<br>Manager: What? No, it's over the budget. You have only 2 minutes to give me your program. <br>Programmer: OK, I guess I can take out the automated build and unit testing part. Which will take 5 minutes. <br>Manager: I don't think you comprehend what I just said. 2 minutes. <br>Programmer: OK, I guess I can just do it without even trying to test run it. BTW, is 3 and 5 going to changed? Will the client want to introduce new requirements to it? It will make more sense if the rules can be configurable by external files...<br>Manager: I don't know. And, you are wasting you time. Just do it. <br><br>-- That's our daily life --<br></p>"
