message: <p>Fast but sloppy programmers - the bane of my existence. Managers love them because they churn out lots of code. Co-workers hate them because the churn out lots of CRAP. <br>It's kinda like the old joke. The warden addressed the prisoners and says "I've got good news and bad news. The bad news is that we have to eat is horse shit. The good news we've got lots of it".</p>
