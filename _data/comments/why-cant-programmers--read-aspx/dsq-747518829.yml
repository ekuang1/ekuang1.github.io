message: <p>It is wrong that I am <strong>so</strong> tempted to post a COBOL version?  :)  Would there even be anyone here who could tell if it was right?  LOL<br>I agree with the reading part.  I think some of it has to do with what the words say differing from the initial picture we get in our minds on the first reading.  I've been guilty of that before; that's why I try to read though things two or three times slowly, to make sure I get what it does and doesn't say.</p>
