message: <p>Clearly efficiency is important, but efficiencies aren't always realized by "programming fast". Reading comprehension is important also but so is critical problem solving thinking, design awareness, and the capability to independently question requirements and identify issues. I think there's so many other factors involved that it's too difficult to make such a binary comparison. You need to look at a more holistic picture - someone who knows theory, is adaptable, works well in ambiguous situations, communicates well, interacts with people well, etc.<br>If I had to consider efficiency just on its own then clearly certain types of efficiencies have been proven to be ineffective, such as IBM's infamous relationship of SLOC with developer productivity.<br>If a programmer can't read specs and requires lots of hand holding, design reviews and iterations, produces crappy code, and doesn't grow reasonably over time with feedback then fire them or transfer them. Get someone that will be a better fit and you won't have as many issues to deal with. If you've got a crappy budget then you'll get what you pay for.</p>
