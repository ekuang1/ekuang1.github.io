Which developer should be rewarded?"<br>Obviously, whichever one is the owners nephew.<br>That post is the best example of "solutions in search of a problem" I've seen in a while. Lots of people wanting to show how they would solve the problem more elegantly using code tricks. It all snowballed off that first example written in VBscript, but it was going to happen no matter what.<br>I also love that you dropped the "www" from his domain when you linked to him. hehehe. That's probably why his site is down, ISAPI-rewrite has spun out of control trying to re-write all the referrals from your post.</p>
