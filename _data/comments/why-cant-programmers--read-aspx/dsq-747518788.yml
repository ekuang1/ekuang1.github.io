message: <p>I think you guys are full of shit.<br>This non-sense ego exualtation.<br>No one is better than I am crap.<br>A Quality programmer is one with a lot of analysis/design and programming experience and one who learns from his experiences either good or bad.<br>You may have guys quick on their feet and very intelligent but if they are not willing to take criticism or advice because they know everything then that is a bad programmer. No one knows everything.<br>I work for a fortune 500 company and thank the Lord we do not ask people to take such meaningless test.<br>it does not indicate to anyone how this person will benefit the company! Geesh! Such sillyness.<br>Bad programmers are those who come up with crazy coding tricks and who refuse input from collegues or from their seniors.</p>
