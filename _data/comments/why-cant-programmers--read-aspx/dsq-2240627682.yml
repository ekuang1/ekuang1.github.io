message: <p>9 Years later... It feels like this could have been written this morning. I believe that all of the "out-of-the-box" solutions have created another level to that environment. The ability to 'hook' up a few things and have something happen gives the Ego another set of distortions. It creates a little addiction that clouds the mind. "I have more activity in my github than you." "I schooled it!" Someone yells as they drop in a plugin and add a bootstrap class. These 6 week courses that promise a job writing angular.js apps can't possibly actually teach you any JavaScript - and sadly, I bet most of the graduates can't write the for loop you probably need for a fizzbuzz "GOTCHA" test. I've heard people on podcasts discussing being tested in an interview as if it was extremely disrespectful. How dare you ask me to prove I can do my job. I worked with a company for a few months recently, and I bet I would have moved up quickly if I was better at basketball. It's a "cool" thing right now, but I think it will burst and knowledgable programers will eventually prevail.</p>
