message: "<p>@Brandon: Yeah, the time pressures are very real and often the cause of this mentality. But it's extremely short sighted at times.<br>For example, does it matter if you came under budget on time if by rushing, there's a bug in the code that does the wrong thing? Did you *really* finish the project on time if the code you produced does the wrong thing?<br>If you go to have a custom car made, and they give you a bicycle, but it's on time. Did they succeed?<br>Also, it's well documented by Steve McConnell and others that the longer a bug is in the system, the more costly it is to find and remove.<br>So by rushing the coding phase, and hoping to catch it in the maintenance/stabilization phase, a project overall is more costly and takes longer.<br>Ideally, project managers would look at the overall cost of a project when judging a developer's productivity and not separate the rush and code stage and the bug-fix stage.<br>If developer A takes 10days to code feature A, but the bugs introduced take 20 days to find and fix. But developer B takes 15 days, and his bugs take 5 days to find and fix. Which developer should be rewarded?</p>"
