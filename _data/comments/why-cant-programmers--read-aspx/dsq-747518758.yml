message: <p>A thought just popped in my head as I was talking this over with a co-worker.  How many programmers do some basic testing as they code.  I know that time can be tight and not really adequate to perform complete testing, but shouldn't you at least mentally walk through code (in the case of the writing a function/subroutine and a piece of paper) at the minimum?</p>
