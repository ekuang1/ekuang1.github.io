message: <p>I know this is an old post, but I have to say that the requirements themselves aren't very clear. The requirements are:<br>1. for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number<br>2. for the multiples of five print “Buzz” (it doesn't say to remove the number)<br>3. for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz” (it doesn't say to ignore the previous rules)<br>It also doesn't say to add returns, either. It seems like an output like this meets the requirements:<br>12Fizz45BuzzFizz78Fizz10Buzz11Fizz1314FizzBuzzFizzBuzz</p>
