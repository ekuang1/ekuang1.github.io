message: "<p>I think the argument between coding fast and coding right isn't always a clear cut one.<br>Sure, we would all love lots of time to test and debug our code to perfection, but most of the time, that just isn't a reality.<br>Just an example, last Thursday, I had to toss some untested code that I wrote at 11:45 at night with a few drinks in me over the wall on to a major client's live site.<br>I sure as hell didn't want to do it, but the code had to be up and running in the morning for a corporate webinar they were having.  Certainly the code could have caused major problems, but there would be equally as many problems if I didn't just get the code up there.<br>It all turned out all right (thank the coding and alcohol gods) except for the fact I only got an hour of sleep because I was stressing about the untested code.<br>The bottom line is: we aren't all writing code for the space shuttle with the luxury of testers, QA, and a large defined process for validating the code.  Sometimes \"good enough\" with the time alloted is all that matters.</p>"
