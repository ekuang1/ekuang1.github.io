message: <p>I just went back there and had to wait 30 seconds for the page to load. I honestly can't believe how many people are, publicly, throwing themselves under a bus.<br>It's almost scarey to see how Jeff's point is borne out by his readers.<br>I liked the comments about recursion. Follow FIzzBuzz with a recursion problem and I think you'd really separate the top guys.<br>But are these the guys you really want tackling (and creatively solving) your company's work? And moreover, are these the guys you want to hang out with at company Christmas parties?</p>
