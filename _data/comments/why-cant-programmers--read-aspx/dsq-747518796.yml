message: "<p>Actually, I did not say that 199 out of 200 graduates cannot program. What I said was that 199 out of 200 people <em>applying for jobs blindly</em> cannot program.<br>I posted a follow-up <a href=\"http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/03/thank-you-for-writing-such-heartfelt.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/03/thank-you-for-writing-such-heartfelt.html\">explaining the math</a>.<br>I can't justify the 199 out of 200 number! <br>I actually stole that from Joel Spolsky. And he didn't say 199 out of 200 can't program at all: he just asserted that 199 out of every 200 people spamming employers are the same people who spam every employer, so you can't assume that you're hiring the top 0.5% just because you reject 199 out of 200 applicants.</p>"
