message: <p>Tell us how you really feel Nate. ;)<br>Honestly, I think you kinda missed the point of the test. The test doesn't tell you who a good programmer is. It's too simple and meaningless for that, as you rightly pointed out.<br>The point of the test is to screen out the self proclaimed programmers who really can't programmer.  I don't know about your company, but at companies I've worked at, we'd get a few hundred submissions for each position. <br>Do we really time to give each submission a rock solid interview? Of course not.</p>
