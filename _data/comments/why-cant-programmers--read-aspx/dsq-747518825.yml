message: <p>I love this topic and I think you can look at it both ways.<br>If you are a programmer that can program, trying to find a company that will let you work to a standard you're happy with is even more difficult.<br>If decent programmers are 1 in 200 I wonder how many companies using software developers would stand up to similar standards. I'm thinking 1 in 400 to be generous.<br>I don't think this helps the situation at all.<br>I see a parallel to the construction industry, some of the highly skilled jobs in construction are now almost obsolete. Craftsmanship is an expensive indulgence, it's all about building things bigger, quicker. ;)</p>
