message: <p>This is prevalent in meetings too.  The whole ADD thing.<br>As soon as people start mentioning technical or design requirements, the "programmer" in us starts thinking of solutions.  Never mind that what they just gave isn't the real spec.  We are already trying to solve it.<br>That happens on written specs too.  We start trying to solve the problem from the first paragraph, and we never finish reading the sentence.</p>
