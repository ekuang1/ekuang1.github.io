message: <p>Rays solution works fine.  It seems like the ones criticizing his program and screaming amen to the article are the ones the article is talking about.  Just because he doesnt explicitly test for the "FizzBuzz" condition doesnt mean it is broken.  I did pretty much the same thing in perl.  I know I could use flags to avoid doing the modulus tests twice but I wanted to do it with the least amount of typing and this solution is copy/paste friendly.<br>#!/usr/bin/perl<br>for(1..100){<br>    print  unless ($_ % 3 == 0 or $_ % 5 == 0);<br>    if ($_ % 3 == 0) {print "Fizz";}<br>    if ($_ % 5 == 0) {print "Buzz";}<br>    print "\n";<br>}<br>And can we give developers the benefit of the doubt that when playing around on a web blog we are not going to read and code a spec with the exact same brain power and resolve that we would on a project at work?  I know I wouldnt.  I dont care about coding some elementary programming project on somebodies web blog exactly to spec.  This is not justification to make mass blanket statements about developers.</p>
