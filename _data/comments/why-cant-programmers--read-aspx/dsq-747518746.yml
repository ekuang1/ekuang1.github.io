message: <p>Man I really want to read that post on CodingHorror, but it is currently down :-(.  I do agree with Rob though in that most programmers have ADD and it is due to that I think programmers miss a lot of the requirements that are written down.  They start to read the reqs then their minds start to wonder around to who knows what.  Since the site is down what were some of the things that were getting posted?  <br>Phil, with concern to the testing wouldn't you agree though that the praise for people being fast is due to Project managers or supervisors view that we need to come in or under budget?  I don't think that is the correct way to think, but that is what I tend to see.  If it is wrong then that is what the maintenance period or stabilization is for.<br></p>
