message: <p>FWIW, Selenium does integrate with NUnit and in fact I just got done adding a bunch of Selenium/NUnit tests to our CI server. Check out Selenium RC and it's .NET support. I've written a blog post about it <a href="http://www.stevetrefethen.com/blog/AutomatedTestingOfASPNETWebApplicationsUsingSelenium.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.stevetrefethen.com/blog/AutomatedTestingOfASPNETWebApplicationsUsingSelenium.aspx">here</a>.<br>I haven't tried WebAii so thanks for the pointer, I'll definitely take a look.</p>
