message: <p>Hi Phill,<br>Could you (or your coworker) explain some more about the problems you experienced with WatiN. Love to improve WatiN even if you decide to move over to another web testing framework (although I think WatiN being open source gives you all the posibilities you might ever need).<br>Thanks in advance,<br>Jeroen van Menen<br>main developer of WatiN</p>
