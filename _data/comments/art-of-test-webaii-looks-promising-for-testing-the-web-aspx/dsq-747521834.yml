message: <p>We've been using WebAii now for a week, with a view to getting a lot of UI tests up very quickly.  We chose it purely for it's ability to abstract the id's of controls outside of the tests, and for test regions, that should allow us to make our component tests reuseable for testing functionality when integrated into a site.<br>I wouldn't worry too much about the MbUnit testing extensions. I did have a crack at trying to write my own MbUnit extension, but found most of the hooks for doing this are internal methods. Apart from the new attributes for test cases (Dialog and another one), all the other shortcuts stuff works fine in MbUnit, if you just use the NUnitTest template.  If you want to use the Initialize() call with some non default/config settings though, you can just pass in Console.WriteLine() instead of the NUnit.Logger method.<br>Although WebAii are looking at building a script recorder tool, I'm looking at modifying the WatinRecorder to allow us to record WebAii tests.. so far it looks like it'll be a fairly easy task.</p>
