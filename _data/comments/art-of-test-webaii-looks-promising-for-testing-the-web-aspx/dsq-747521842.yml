message: <p>Phil, <br>I have to agree with you, this is very exciting.  I downloaded the RC0 version that is listed on ArtOfTest's Website today and I cannot stop digging into it.  Their RC0 now has an HTML control set in it.  You can do Generic finds and have a strongly typed html control....VERY NICE!<br>Thanks for the find!<br>Kevin<br></p>
