message: <p>Thought I should add a few things..<br>We've quickly noticed, there are quite a few things in WebAii which can be painful to achieve, compared to previous testing frameworks we've used.  Things like checking visibility of controls (i.e. for ASP.NET validation with client side script .. among many other cases).  I've already asked for that one, but been told it's not likely for v1.0. Even the VERY regular tasks of checking for text on a page is the unreadable affair, of:<br>Assert.IsNotNull(Find.ByContent("p:sometext", InnerText));<br>compared to, say in selenium:<br>Assert.IsTrue(isTextPresent("someText")); <br>BTW just to add, there is nothing stopping you from driving Selenium tests from MbUnit, or CruiseControl .. We've been doing that for a while now as native C# tests, similar to WebAii/WATIN.  The FireFox IDE/recorder will also generate NUnit C# tests as well as Selenese/HTML (and easily modified for MbUnit), though this is not obvious without a bit of digging.  To drive from xUnit, you need to get the Selenium Remote Control package for .NET, and fire up it's java service before running the tests.  <br>I've got a NANT script for doing all this (bit tricky as the java server needs to be spawned .. something not easily done in NANT at the moment), and examples of MbUnit/ASP.NET helpers if anybody is interested.<br>We've just decided to try out WebAii as it is a bit lighter, and easier to setup, and has much better support for us reusing tests ... we're missing the recorder though!</p>
