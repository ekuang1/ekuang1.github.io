message: <p>So WebAii doesn't have a test recorder out of the box? Looks like Selenium is still better -- a working test recorder is what sets Selenium apart from every other func tester I've seen. Also, getting Selenium to kick out tests in your test tool of choice is just a matter of altering the formatter. I've got one around for C# / VStest if you need it (I may have posted it on the Selenium newsgroup).</p>
