message: <p>if I go to c# is not so i try to mimic what other languages do, again like in other posts, as an ex linux java person the more i realize about c# and .net the more i crave to go back since c# is now like you started the article, copying the good features of other languages, can .net really stand up and actually be a leader by not copying things like this but really analysing the problems at hand and inventing new techniques ? if i need this then i go back to php, which had this feature back in 2000 , are we catching up or what ?</p>
