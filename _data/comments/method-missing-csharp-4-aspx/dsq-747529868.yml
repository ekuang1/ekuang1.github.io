message: <p>Bit more thought.<br>Dynamic suggests that everything is a Dog if it goes woof. Well Like the joke says, you can make a cat go woof by setting it alight. But whats the use of dead Cat that should have been a dog that is burnt to a crisp just because you want to make something do a really cool thing that its "not suppose to do". Yes we can all break rules but the rules are there for a reason. In the case of the cat, we all love cats and don't want to set them alight. you get my drift.<br>It really comes down to good programming form. There is nothing new that Dynamic really introduces to the CLR that you couldn't do since CLR 1.0. All the dynamic stuff does is make it easier. I mean there has always been Dynamic Invocation on code written on the fly, what the difference really. If you really scared you could always bung the code into a brand new appDomain, and unload it if it gets too scary for your main app.<br>The Dynamic stuff will however make companies like ours change the policy of languages used. It would be nice to have a big switch to say "nope, no funny stuff here if you please mr Graduate programmer who wants to impress me with his powerful syntax". This would allow the abuse to be done by people who know what they are doing and know the consequences, instead of the "oh no, new boy has done some dynamic crap here, lets go back to beta and remove it" approach.</p>
