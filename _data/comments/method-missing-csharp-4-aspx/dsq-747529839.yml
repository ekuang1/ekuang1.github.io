message: <p>I am struggling with why views are to be statically typed.  For simple cases where the view and entity are 1:1, then it doesn't matter.  For other cases it seems like building ViewModels in the controller just to pass to the view is a lot of brainless work.<br>For example, if I want to have a create shipment view that shows the empty shipment, with a list of customer addresses, a list of all freight carriers, etc... I'd like to just:<br>var shipment = order.CreateShipment(); // or whatever...<br>var addresses = order.Customer.ShipToAddresses;<br>var carriers = carrierRepository.GetAllCarriers();<br>return View(new { Shipment = shipment, Addresses = addresses, Carriers = carriers));<br>Is this something dynamic will allow in future of MVC?  Or is this really stupid?  Or can you do this right now and I'm really stupid?<br>Also, I think maybe some complaints with this and dynamic is that it is hard for me to test rendering that view without firing up selenium/watin, or can I do this from a unit test somehow (just to ensure the view renders, not to test that it is 'right')?<br>I like static typing in my model, but view just seems like a lot of work to make up for lack of tests.</p>
