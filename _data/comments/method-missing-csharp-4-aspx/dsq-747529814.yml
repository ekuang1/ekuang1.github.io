message: <p>Interesting post. I lean more toward statically typed programming myself as several posters have already mentioned.<br>I do appreciate the tone of the post though. Playful and fun instead of stodgy and institutional. I wish more people posted in a similar manner. <br>Programming is supposed to be fun after all!</p>
