message: <p>I saw someone comment on the VB "features" which are commonly misused. I assume that what is meant here are the features <code>Option Explicit Off</code>, <code>Option Infer On</code>, and <code>Option Strict Off</code>. As a VB developer, I will readily admit that these three settings together do tend to encourage sloppy coding. I personally set Explicit and Strict On at project level in every one of my projects. I find that Infer is useful in that, for example, I can write a LINQ query and keep adjusting it until I get the type I need (which is shown by intellisense when I hover its variable). I then make a habit of explicitly declaring the type. Having said all this, however, I, like some of the others above, have found that I miss the ability to add "expando" properties to objects under certain circumstances. Does Dynamic make it into VB 4? Also, Kudos on the example. I do not use C# because I don't much like the C++ style of syntax (also why I choose not to use much JavaScript and why I don't use Java), but my understanding is that each language (VB and C#) is supposed to gain features of the other until they are matched and versioned in lock-step...</p>
