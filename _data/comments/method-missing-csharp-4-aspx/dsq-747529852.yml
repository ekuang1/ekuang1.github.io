message: <p>@notsure "if I go to c# is not so i try to mimic what other languages do, again like in other posts, as an ex linux java person the more i realize about c# and .net the more i crave to go back since c# is now like you started the article, copying the good features of other languages, can .net really stand up and actually be a leader by not copying things like this but really analysing the problems at hand and inventing new techniques "<br>Not to insult, but  that was the longest sentence I've ever read. <br>.Net isn't "copying" other languages, its evolving into something new. What other language or framework does what .Net does? Oh, there isn't one? Okay then.</p>
