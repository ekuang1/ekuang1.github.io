message: <p>I don't have a problem with the keyword dynamic by itself, but Dynamic expression is what mess up ENTIRE project, just because one idiot decide to abuse dynamic expression so bad that we had to fire him. And this doesn't end there, Microsoft had to do another stupid move by spamming dynamic expressions on Excel Plugins. Most of the methods are made for single type input or output, putting a keyword dynamic over the hard type make this harder than needed.<br>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
