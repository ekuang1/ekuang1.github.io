message: "<p>This is all very interesting....   So many of you get so angry because Microsoft decides to loosen the chain and <em>let you DO something</em>.  You <strong>do not have to use it.  I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to do something completely rational yet the strong typedness of the CLR got in my way.  Mocking clas properties that aren't marked virtual, for example.  No, this doesn't address that problem, but its a tool.  Its something that competes with languages like Python and Ruby that are incredibly powerful in their own way.  </strong></p><p>Mostly, though, Ruby is a pleasure to write (or so I hear over and over and over and...).  I LOVE c# syntax and I love programming in dot net.  So much that my Ruby exploration has taken 4 years and I am still just a Ruby wannabe novice.  This feature does two remarkable things:  1) it allows me to write code that might otherwise be impossible and force me to use a dynamic language (IronRuby, perhaps)</p><p> and 2) it provides me with yet another shortcut that I can use when time to market is more important than whether I can check boxes next to some list of proper code commandments.  <br></p><p>I appreciate the innovations that Microsoft has been delivering that allow me to do what I need to do to succeed in business and keep my job rather than have to adhere to strict static type dogma and sit in my mother's basement writing scores of <em>correct</em> code.</p><p><br></p><p>Stop pretending like placing restrictions on what you can do is a good thing.</p>"
