message: <p>Personally, I don't like it.<br>I understand why it's there, and for COM interop, something like this needed to be added to C#, but it's been added as a "general purpose" feature that WILL be abused.<br>At the risk of starting a flame war, it's so-called "features" like this that made lots of decent VB.NET developers switch to C#.  To get away from the "features" that allow you to be exceptionally sloppy in your coding.<br>Everyone is saying, "But you don't HAVE to use this feature". But it WILL get used and abused in the real world when deadlines loom and code gets rushed in the name of "getting it out of the door".  It's the "other guys" who end up maintaining code written like this that get to deal with the "flexibility" of a dynamic keyword sprinkled all over a code base when correct and proper engineering discipline would dictate that strongly-typed classes/objcets be used instead.<br>Just as you don't HAVE to use VB.NET's "features" (most in the name of backwards-compatibility) that promote sloppyness and corner-cutting in your code, for every 1 VB.NET coder that DOES do things "properly", there's 100 that DON'T.<br></p>
