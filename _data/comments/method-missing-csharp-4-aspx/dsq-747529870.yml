message: "<p>This feature was present in other languages years ago. It has been in production applications using these languages. This feature also breaks the \"static typing\".<br>So you like non static typing, you love features from other non static typing languages. Question. If you mod your car like (for example) a VW Golf: wheels,  door, interior. Why don't you buy a golf? &lt;- Now apply this to C#.<br>You will loose this:<br><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/859186/why-is-c-statically-typed\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/859186/why-is-c-statically-typed\">stackoverflow.com/.../why-is-c-statically-typed</a><br>I like the feature, but I see that C# is becoming a mix of everything. Without being the best at many things.</p>"
