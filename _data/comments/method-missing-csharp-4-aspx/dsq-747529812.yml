message: <p>Very cool Haackage there! I like. However, now <strong>my</strong> convention that the View to be rendered is determined by the name of the strongly typed viewmodel class passed to the view will not work. <br>eg. return View(new IndexHomeViewModel {}); will render the IndexHome view.<br>Kudos for extending the boundaries though!</p>
