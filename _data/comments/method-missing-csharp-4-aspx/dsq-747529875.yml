message: <p>First, use language, do not misuse it!<br>Second, use proper tools (in our case classes), don't do "ma' look what I made!"<br>Third and most important, think about team members, if you are about to do something, ask them, maybe they are lazy to learn!<br>My point is, if you need to create something, make it inexpensive and with good quality. If you don't need DLR than do not use it. Also, play for a while with tools, try to do things, just to see how useful it can be or not.</p>
