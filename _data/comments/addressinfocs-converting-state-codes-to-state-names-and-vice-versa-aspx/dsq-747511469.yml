message: <p>Thanks very much for the AddressInfo code.  I am in the process of writing a class almost exactly like that, and in the middle of writing it, I wondered if someone had already written some state code/state name enumerations and conversions.  Sure enough, Google led me to this page.<br><br><br><br>This will save me a bunch of time.  You have my gratitude.<br><br><br><br>If anyone has trouble finding the link to download the code, the link can be found by clicking on the word "here" in the sentence "The class itself can be downloaded here.".  In my browser the link was the same color as the rest of the text, so it took me a while to figure out where to download the file.<br><br></p>
