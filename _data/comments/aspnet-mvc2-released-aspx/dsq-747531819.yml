message: <p>@Chris we already have some crazy dynamic tricks we'll be showing soon. What else it buys us is built in support for features added in .NET 4. For example, MVC 2 doesn't support new data annotations added in .NET 4 because we weren't compiled against .NET 4.<br>Also, we can do code cleanup for cases where .NET 4 has built in features that we had to implement.</p>
