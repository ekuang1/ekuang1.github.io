message: <p>Happy birthday.  I also bought a CIT200 recently and other than a few small issues getting it to play nice with Vista, it has worked well.  Now the wife doesn't get quite so upset when I get on marathon conference calls from the home office, and Skype-out is so much cheaper than a dedicated phone line.</p>
