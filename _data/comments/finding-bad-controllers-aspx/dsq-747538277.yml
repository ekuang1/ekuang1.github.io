message: <p>Phil I want to add that you'll need to create a solution with the following properties:<br>0.Be a C# project. (Since VB.NET handles namespaces a little different with default namespaces).<br>1.Be a multi-project mvc 3 project. <br>2.The primary project should have a Area defined in it. <br>3.The second project should have a output type of class library.<br>4.The namespace in the file of the secondary project should be different than the one found according to the values found under Properties -&gt; Application -&gt; AssemblyName  and Default namespace in the secondary project. This will be the controller that will have a 404 issue. <br> In particular the mvc runtime always tries to look relative to the project where the Area is defined before other projects. <br>P.S. Another potential 404 issue I haven't seen much Microsoft documentation on is setting up views in a multi-project like this to avoid 404 errors.<br>For example,by default the Build Action for the Views you add to your project have a default value of “Content”. You need to change this to “Embedded Resource” so the view will be embedded into the .dll and the route found after you ensure the .dll is being properly exported to &lt;primary_projname_with_Area&gt;\bin.  This will happen when you add a MVC project outside of where the main “Area“ is defined in the primary project where the Area is defined.<br>P.P.S Same type of problem with trying to get the runtime to properly resolve the location of JavaScript files in multi-project solutions where the project isn't the primary one with the Area. Although this was one issue I didn't get to fix and it didn't include a 404 error but it was failing to find the right file though.<br></p>
