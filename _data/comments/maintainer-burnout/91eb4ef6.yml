message: It would be interesting to somehow assess burnout across packages and see how prevalent it is. I know, for example, that I've been working on Autofac for _years_ and we've asked regularly for... well, pretty much _anyone_ to [come and help](https://www.paraesthesia.com/archive/2018/04/02/autofac-looking-for-extension-owners/) with some of the extension packages that integrate with various app types. We've had exactly ZERO takers. There are a lot of folks willing to consume, but with maintenance comes support, documentation, and all the other stuff that consumers assume will "just be there" but _also_ takes time to generate. And, of course, there are the vocal minority who feel entitled to things and get attitudes... (You may be able to tell I, myself, am riding that burnout line.)
