  You have a typo... "Sometime in 20189..."



  Seems like one way to avoid the burn-out problem is to have multiple people helping out, contributing to the project. The challenge here isn't just finding people who are willing to contribute and help out, but in keeping them doing that.



  I have contributed to two open source projects.



  In one case the code I contributed was completely re-written by the time it was released. I had followed the style guide, written unit tests, done everything as asked, and ultimately my only contribution was the idea.



  In the other case we needed a feature, so I added it and created a PR. The maintainer proceeded to tell me why I was wrong for needing that feature. Fine, we now have a local copy of that package.



  My point being, if you want people to contribute, act like you appreciate the effort. Those two experiences made me disinclined to want to help anyone else out.
