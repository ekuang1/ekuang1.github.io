message: "<p>You rock Phil! This looks to be awesome. Except, I'm having trouble getting it going in my project. It doesn't seem to matter where I put the dotless.core.dll, I keep getting \"Compiling transformation: Metadata file 'dotless.Core.dll' could not be found\". I've included it in a solution folder like your screenshot above, and your sample solution doesn't give me the same problem, so I'm kinda out of ideas. Anybody got any tips for me?</p>"
