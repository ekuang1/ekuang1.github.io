message: <p>@Dan, copy the DLL into the root of your solution and *then* add it to the Solution folder. It can't just be anywhere on your drive. I think it has to be at the same level as the .sln file. <br>The Solution Items folder is a "virtual" folder. It doesn't represent where the actual assembly is on disk.</p>
