message: <p>Personally, I've never really liked the guards that were put up to block comment spam.  It's an all-or-nothing approach that once someone figures a way around, it is useless.<br>So, what ends up happening is the guards become tougher, but it makes those that are trying to comment legitimately frustrated, and ends up providing a bad user experience.<br>To this end, I would say that heuristics are a better approach, because they can be tweaked.  PHP-based sites have had a number of options available for some time.  The problem with these is that when new heuristic algorithms were created, one would have to constantly update them.<br>That's where Akismet comes in.  It is a (free) online service that you can send your comments to, and it will make a decision if it is spam or not.  Then, you can decide to publish the spam or not.<br>It also has a feature that alows you to say that a comment is not spam if the service says it is, and to say that a comment is spam if the service says it is not.<br>The great part about this is that theoretically, the more comments that are submitted, the "smarter" it gets.<br>The link for the site is:<br><a href="http://akismet.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://akismet.com">http://akismet.com</a><br>There is a developers link at:<br><a href="http://akismet.com/development/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://akismet.com/development/">http://akismet.com/developm...</a><br>There is one library there implemented in .NET which you can use.  I also have my own library, which of course, I support (and it's free as well).<br>If you are interested in it, email me, and I will be more than happy to provide it to you.<br>On a side note, I am eagerly waiting for the release of Subtext 1.9 for ASP.NET 2.0.  Keep up the good work.</p>
