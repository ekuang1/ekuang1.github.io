message: <p>I've also been getting a lot of comment spam lately on my subtext site.  I agree with the ReverseDOS folks that CAPTCHA will only prevent legitimate posts before too long as the bots get more sophisticated.<br>What about something similar to the challenge/response systems that were developed to deal with email spam?  In this scenario, all comments would be moderated.  However, when you (as a SubText admin) allow a comment to be displayed, the email address (or some identifier) associated to that commenter is stored in a "valid commenters" list.  The next time that commenter leaves a comment, it is posted without being moderated.<br>The main drawback I see to this system is that commenters will be required to leave their email address if they don't want to be moderated.<br>I guess another drawback is that there is a lot of moderation involved for the subtext admin.  But at this point I'm starting to think that I'm already spending a lot of time cleaning up the spam so I might not be opposed to spending a fraction of the time moderating comments since I'm actually building a white list of commenters.<br>I'm sure that there are more holes in this system than what I've listed.  Thoughts?  Ideas?</p>
