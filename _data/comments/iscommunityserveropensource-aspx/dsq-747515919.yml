message: <p>Great discussion. I agree with some, disagree with some, and am on the fence on other parts :)<br>The term I personally use when describing Community Server's very, very permissive source licensing model is 'Shared Source' and I agree that applying the term 'Open Source' would not be completely correct (although you can also have a very pedantic debate about what the semantic meaning of Open Source really is).<br>I've been on both sides of the open source discussion and while I can appreciate the nuances of both closed and open source there is sometimes a very good reason for doing something in the middle.<br>Polarized debates about 'it has to be this way or I can't use it' are pretty worthless. Instead of allowing the source discussion to polarize you to a single line of thinking I always (personally) try to view it as a sliding scale. A lot of what we (Telligent) have tried to do is combine some of the best elements of both. Beyond the scope of the simple, 'what's good for the developer' you also have to think of 'what's good for the customer'. Believe it or not licensing terms are a pretty big deal to a lot of organizations depending upon how the software is made available.</p>
