message: <p>I don't mean to answer for Rob, but I started a post tonight that would contain a link to the EULA as well as to other Community Server license references.  Good point about the license not being available at <a href="http://cs.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="cs.org">cs.org</a>.  I converted a copy of the Commercial License to PDF (the same contained with the source you saw in RTF and TXT) and put it online in the <a href="http://cs.org" rel="nofollow noopener" title="cs.org">cs.org</a> downloads area at<br><a href="http://communityserver.org/files/folders/licensing/entry540205.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://communityserver.org/files/folders/licensing/entry540205.aspx">http://communityserver.org/...</a><br>There is also a Community License covering the free version of Community Server which you'll find here.<br><a href="http://communityserver.org/i/licensing.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://communityserver.org/i/licensing.aspx">http://communityserver.org/...</a><br></p>
