message: <p>Thomas,<br>  As Phil stated Open Source is not an indication of the availability of source code, but rather your specific usage rights vis-a-vis copyrighted software.  It is quite possible and legitimate for the same source code to have multiple licenses, each of which gives you different rights regarding the software in question.  When you pay for "Open Source" software you are in fact paying for a particular license and not for the software itself.  I could post every single line of code to my software in a public place, but not give you a license to copy, install, or run the software and I would not be Open Source.</p>
