message: "<p>Rob: \"Believe it or not licensing terms are a pretty big deal to a lot of organizations depending upon how the software is made available.\"<br>This statement fascinates me.

I don't disagree with it, mainly because I don't have any evidence either way.<br>In what way does the licensing terms matter to organizations in your experience Rob?</p>"
