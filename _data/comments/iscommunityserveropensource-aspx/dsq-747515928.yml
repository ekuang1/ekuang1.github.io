message: <p>Telligent appears to have chosen the path of the radical middle (it's phrase used by former Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, in response to a question about political position). It is innovative and risky. There are many business models for covering both ends of the licensing/development spectrum. Their approach makes the source transparent and adaptable, contributes to a rapidly growing development and user community exploring this accessbility, and provides some measure of predictable direction and quality to the core product.<br>The trouble with working in binary is that sometimes our minds get stuck in either-or :)</p>
