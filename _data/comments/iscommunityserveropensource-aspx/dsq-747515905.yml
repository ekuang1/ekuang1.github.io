message: <p>Phil, You made excellent points here on the licensing aspects that define an application as Open Source.  And you're absolutely right.  Very well written.  I didn't address licensing in my post and maybe should have.  As for my "definition of open source" being the availability of the source code, the keyword was it being a BASELINE definition to serve as a starting point only.<br>It is hard to discuss these issues without sounding like a zealot, either way. :-)  But "Code Available."  I like that!<br>Again, a very thoughtful post on the licensing aspects of Open Source.  Thank you for writing it.<br>Dave Burke<br></p>
