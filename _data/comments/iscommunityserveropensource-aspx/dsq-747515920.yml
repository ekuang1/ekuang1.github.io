message: <p>Hey Rob, thanks for chiming in.<br>As you said, it ultimately comes down to what is good for the customer.  I've tried to go to great lengths <strong>not</strong> to frame this discussion as "one is better than the other".  That is a pointless discussion as you point out.<br>However, there is value in attempting to refine and agree upon the meaning of specific terms.  Doing so helps create a general taxonomy of software licensing so that we have a common language to discuss groups of licenses.  This is the whole motivation behind Design Patterns, no?  <br>When I say a license is <em>Open Source</em>, there are a whole variety of licenses I might be referring to.  But if there is consensus on the taxonomy (such as using the OSD definition), you can infer certain characteristics of the license based on that categorization.  The same thing applies to <em>Shared Source</em>.<br>There is value in attempting to work out the semantics of these terms so we can all understand each other and speak the same language.<br>Ultimately, being open source or not is not enough to indicate whether a piece of software "works" for a customer.  It ultimately comes down to that piece of software's license.  As you pointed out, licensing terms are a big deal to customers.<br>Speaking of which, I could not find the full Shared Source license on the Telligent or CS website. I had to download the source to view the EULA.  Am I just missing something?</p>
