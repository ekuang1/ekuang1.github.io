message: <p>Just to be clear, Phil, I wasn't addressing you with my response -- more of just a general statement of opinion :)<br>Scott, I'd love to give you a complete response, but I don't think it's fair to have this type of discussion in a comment section of a blog. It's a much, much larger topic. But, I do want to answer the basic question surrounding licesning.<br>The simple answer is that a number of organizations want the side benefits that commercially licensed software brings. For example,  a business responsible for the software provides certain guarantees and a source customers can go to when problems arise. Furthermore, closed source licenses allow the organizations to have better control over the applications from a versioning perspective (less moving targets). We have a number of customers for Community Server that move to our commercial licensing model off of other OSS platforms specifically for the implict contract that is then created between the organization and us.<br>I realize that statement is 100% debatable but this is based on direct experience as an ISV. Please also understand that I'm an advocate for both sides of this argument, OSS and closed source; although I personally like the 'somewhere inbetween' option that Community Server's licensing model offers.<br>Another interesting perspective here is to take a deeper look into the much more mature non-Windows OSS licensed software options. There have been a lot of quiet changes by products such as MySql and others to change some of their licensing options. Yes, they are still liberal, but not quite as liberal as they once were.<br>Again, for us, we're interested finding a middle ground solution that works for us as a businesses and developers that want to do interesting things with our platform. It's not perfect for everyone, but it has proven to be succesful.</p>
