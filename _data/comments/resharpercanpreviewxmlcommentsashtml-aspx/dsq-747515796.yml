message: <p>I was going to mention trying CR_Documentor, but it looks like Jim beat me to it. :)  (Though I will mention CR_Documentor adds other stuff beyond just doc preview, like a context menu that, among other things, allows you to select part of your comment and XML encode it - handy for code snippets you want to place as examples.)</p>
