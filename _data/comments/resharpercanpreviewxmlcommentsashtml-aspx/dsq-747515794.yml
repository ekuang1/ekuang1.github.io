message: <p>Travis Illig's CR_Documentor does a nice job in this arena, too, but you need DxCore installed to use the widget.<br>Travis's tool is here (<a href="http://www.paraesthesia.com/blog/comments.php?id=701_0_1_0_C)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.paraesthesia.com/blog/comments.php?id=701_0_1_0_C)">http://www.paraesthesia.com...</a> and I wrote a blurb about it here (<a href="http://visualstudiohacks.com/CRDocumentor)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://visualstudiohacks.com/CRDocumentor)">http://visualstudiohacks.co...</a>.<br>The DxCore thing may be a show-stopper for many.  It's "free" but has got a pretty restrictive license on where you can use it -- unless you buy one of the other DevExpress products.</p>
