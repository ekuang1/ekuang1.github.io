message: '<p>A model, view and controller walk into a bar.  They each order a round of drinks and proceed to get hammered.  As they are walking out, the model says to the view, "Can you drive home again?  The last time you got pulled over, the cop had no idea how to test you."<br>Disclaimer: This joke in no way supports or condones drunk driving... nor does it support any claims of being funny.</p>'
