message: "<p>Well, you reminded of a few that were going around a few years back:<br>* Two packets walk into a pcap bar. One says to the other, \"can I sniff you?\"<br>In Israel we have a variation on that one, adding something about going to the TLV (which is a name of a club, shorthand for Tel Aviv).<br>* The very famous and slightly better that the last one: Two c-strings walk into a bar. The first one says to the bartender, \"Can I have a beer and some kcdasffdsfasd%$$%#%#@%$#%@\". The other string turns to the bartender and says \"You have to excuse my friend, he is not null terminated\".<br><br>* And a variation on the last one: A c-strings walk into a bar. It says to the bartender, \"Can I have a beer and some fadsh543%$%lkjfdslfj/bin/sh\". The bartender turns and says \"Welcome root, You've got mail\".<br><br>And before you say anything, you started it! :)</p>"
