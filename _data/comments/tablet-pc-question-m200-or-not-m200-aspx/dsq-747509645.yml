message: <p>i haven't used m200, but i have a protege 3500 that i use as a desktop computer. my preferd tablet is motions 1400 with VA. Anything else is a bad deal, most important avoid convertibles, detachable keyboards, docking stations make an attached keyboard unneccesary...motion tablets also have speak anywhere technology so that you never need a mic (voip, dictation, voice command). The also have more accesories than anybody else.<br><br><br><br>In my opinion the only interesting thing about convertibles is the ooohhhs and aahhhhs you get when you swivel that display like inspector gadget!!!</p>
