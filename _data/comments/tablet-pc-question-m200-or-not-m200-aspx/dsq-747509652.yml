message: <p>Good question.  I'm starting to lean towards the slate because its lighter, and many come with a keyboard you can attach.  <br><br><br><br>As Iggy mentioned, the Motions 1400 with VA looks appealing because it can be viewed nicely at wide angles etc...<br><br><br><br>I also type faster than I write, but I'm not planning to use a Tablet for speed. Mainly to reduce up the amount of time I'm sitting at a desk typing.  I spend too much time typing and need to break up my day more. ;)</p>
