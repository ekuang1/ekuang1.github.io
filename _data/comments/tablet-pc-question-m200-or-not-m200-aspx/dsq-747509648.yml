message: <p>I got an M200 and love it. I would only consider the M200 if I had to do it again. But that is not because I am biased to Toshiba, but rather because that is how I work. I like the faster proc and the 1400x1050 screen. I use it with a 17" flatpanel as an extended desktop. For honest reviews of all tablets, see <a href="http://www.tabletpcbuzz.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.tabletpcbuzz.com">www.tabletpcbuzz.com</a> <br><br><br><br>Frankly put, the M200 or any other tablet is not a replacement to a keyboard. I (and probably everyone reading this) can type much faster than I write. But that is not the point.<br><br><br><br>The point of the tablet is to allow one to elevate handwritten ink from merely being a graphical footnote to ubiquitous text to being equal to text. There are a lot that you can do with a Tablet that you can't do with a keyboard and mouse. As to killer apps, OneNote is pretty close for me. I use it at least 2 hours a day. It orders things that are difficult to order otherwise.</p>
