message: <p>Same here.  I had one and got rid of it in about a month. (I did have one when they very first same out, so I am not sure how they are now though.)  It was only cool when I pulled it out for meetings to take notes.  Besides that, it was pretty much as useful as the Calendar on my cell phone.  I was not impressed with the CPU power and screen resolution.  Until there is that "killer app", I would really reconsider your purchase.  Plus I hear rumors that Apple is thinking of creating one! :)  If anyone can get it right, it will be them!<br><br></p>
