message: <p>In high school I read the book Sphere. That made me want to be an aero-space engineer for NASA developing a ship that could travel in the way that ship did. <br><br><br><br>Then I looked at how much they were making, something like 30-60k a year in their prime and decided against it. The fact that humans aren't really meant for that kind of travel set in shortly thereafter and I realized I wouldn't really be doing a "dream job". <br><br><br><br>I then turned to programming and actually wanted to be a programmer. I liked the idea of having a problem and making my computer solve it. I went to college, got into working for my ISP, dropped out of college and here I sit. I don't code much in a language or make a compiled application but I do some programming. I still use a lot of the skills I taught myself about coding and problem solving techniques but I realized pretty early on that I didn't want to program for 8+ hours a day. <br><br><br><br>What also keeps women from a typical programming job is the grueling hours. When deadlines hit it's pretty common for people to work excessively long hours and I'm not saying all women don't want to work over time but there is so much of a demand on the worker I'm surprised ANYONE actually WANTS to work in those environments. You're severely overworked and underpaid but I guess as long as you see those little brackets everything is okay? Not for me, I need a little bit more. I would enjoy making a quality product but I would not enjoy the intense strain that is put on almost every single software developer I've ever run into. Luckily my job isn't just development but I have made a number of tools that help my day go by quicker. <br><br><br><br>Honestly the profession isn't really suited for anyone. It takes some pretty strong people to put up with the kind of crap developer's put up with day in, day out. I'm surprised there is even a software industry with some of the stories I've heard. I'm not saying women are generally weaker but men tend to put up with more crap than women. We can tolerate a ton of injustice before we speak up, if we even speak up at all. Women are more vocal by nature and communicate when problems arise. This either causes them to leave when something isn't changed, or they work their butts off to get something done. Men on the other hand simply tolerate whatever it is and rarely ever speak up about a problem. It appears that men are "good workers" when in reality they just take the crap shovelled to them. Women are then seen as "bitchy" and sometimes canned because although the grievance is valid the company doesn't care. If Bill can suck it up and work all weekend why can't Mary? Maybe it's because Bill doesn't have a family to think about or is a pushover who doesn't want to upset the hand that feeds him?</p>
