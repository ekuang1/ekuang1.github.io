message: <p>While we're on Codeplex + NuPack... It would be cool if each CodePlex project maintainer had the ability to upload NuPack packages analagous to (but separate from) the source/binary release artifacts it already supports.  You could turn all of Codeplex into a dynamic NuPack repository.  Every Codeplex project that has a NuPack package artifact would be automatically included in the feed.  Updated packages would be immediately reflected in the feed.<br>Since the Codeplex projects are already uniquely identifiable by their DNS names, it could pretty easily take the host name part of the FQDN (i.e., the projectname from <a href="http://projectname.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="projectname.codeplex.com">projectname.codeplex.com</a>) and treat it as the package name.  This would get around any naming issues, since host names already have a restricted alphabet.  If a project has several NuPack packages, you could use projectname- as a prefix for each package in a given project.<br>Codeplex could very easily ride the wave of the practically 100% positive press NuPack has been getting (deservedly so--it's awesome).  I wasn't sure if I should post this on the NuPack project's discussion since it's really more of a CodePlex suggestion.</p>
