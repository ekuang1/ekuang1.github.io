message: '<p>First of all a BIG THANK YOU to Lugroff and Mike.  That´s what I did exactly for my shadow to work on BOTH the left side and the right side of my page.<br>div.mainmiddle-wrapper-m {<br>padding: 0px 15px 0px 15px;   <br>/* border-left: 1px solid #D2D2D2; */ this was how the template was originally set up<br>/* border-right: 1px solid #D2D2D2;*/  this was how the template was originally set up<br>background: #ffffff;<br>background-image: url(../images/main_l.png), url(../images/main_r.png);<br>background-repeat: repeat-y;<br>background-position: left, right;<br>So basically i just added the two shadow images, 10pixelX10pixel png shadow, separated by the comma. I also had to do some slight modifications on the shadow of the top left and bottom left (wrapper-m tl and wrapper-m bl) because the lines weren´t alligned exactly. Now the main middle wrapper has a lot more DEPTH to it thanks to the shadows.<br>Here are the final results and it definnetely makes the page "POP OUT" and much more visually attractive.<br><a href="http://www.profesorpirata.com/mejores-reproductores-de-video-para-windows.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.profesorpirata.com/mejores-reproductores-de-video-para-windows.html">www.profesorpirata.com</a><br>Thanks again for your help and also for the Great Site!!<br>Cheers,</p>'
