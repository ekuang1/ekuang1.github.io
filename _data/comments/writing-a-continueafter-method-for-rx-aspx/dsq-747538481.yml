message: <p>Great discussion. Paul's right, half the fun of Rx is coming up with different ways of doing things - I sometimes think it's more of an art than a science.<br>Which means of course, I have an opinion! Personally, I don't like that you're concatenating two unrelated streams (and that transformation is only there to satisfy the type system, which is a bit of a smell). You're not interested in the values of the first stream, just doing something when it finishes. There's already a construct for that - the onCompleted action passed to Subscribe.<br>And I know it's an example scenario, but it also seems a little odd to be driving this from the progress indicators of an extract method. My problem with this is that this isn't the main process, but a notification - it's only purpose is to provide progress information. If you want to do anything with the data you've extracted, you need to refer back to the original object that produced the first stream, which means you've got state. I'd suggest it would be better to have a completed event on this original object, or a stream that exposed the data you're extracting so you can genuinely act on and transform that data. <br>Chaining streams like this just seems so, well, *procedural*.<br></p>
