message: <p>I think these newfangled extensions can easily turn C#, a beautiful and approachable language, into (gasp!) C++. It was hard enough to get your head around its syntax and semantics, but templates turned C++ into an absurdly difficult language. I bet a very large number of older C# programmers are former C++ programmers who never looked back.</p><p>You always hear that these features are optional, but in reality, you always feel like an idiot for not groking it.  You feel as if you're doing you're craft a disservice by not using them, which is probably why you wrestled with Rx instead of picking a quick and dirty solution. LINQ was difficult, but it's definately worth learning. Using R# helped nail it down for me.</p><p>The problem I have the reactive extensions is that it makes you think too hard. It took me several reads before figuring out that IObservable is the producer and IObserver is the consumer. A better nomenclature such as IPublisher/ISubscriber would have made it a lot easier to figure out. IPimp/IProstitute or IPusher/IAddict would have been just as good, albeit crude.</p><p>BTW:<br>Rx is a symbol for a drug store or pharmacy. After I made the IPusher/IAddict remark, I am now wondering if the Rx is an inside joke playing off of Reactive's push mechanism?  If this is true, it means Microsofties actually have a sense of humor.</p>
