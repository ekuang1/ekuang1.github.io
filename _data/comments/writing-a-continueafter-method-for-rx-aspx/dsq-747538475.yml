message: <p>@Jerome I'm not too concerned about <code>Aggregate</code> calling a lambda. After all, in your solution you suggest calling <code>ToArray</code>. The implementation of that calls <code>ToList</code>. The implementation of <em>that</em> calls <code>Aggregate</code>. So we're back to square one! :)</p>
