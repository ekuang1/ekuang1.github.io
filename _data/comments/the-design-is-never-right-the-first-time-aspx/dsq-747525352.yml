message: <p>The fact that your last-minute changes passed all the regression tests reduces the probability that you broke something by a factor of "N." The factor N depends on a huge number of things, but based on personal experience I'd say as large as 10 would be unusual and somewhere between 2 and 4 would be typical.</p>
