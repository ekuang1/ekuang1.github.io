message: "<p>A comment from Rick Brewster (<a href=\"http://Paint.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"Paint.net\">Paint.net</a>) at coding horror (<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000980.html)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000980.html)\">http://www.codinghorror.com...</a><br>I read something about an old version of Google Groups (I think that's what it was). The developers were trying to choose between two ways of sorting or organizing the data, and they couldn't come to a consensus about which one they should go with. So they shipped a beta with NEITHER. They then got 100 e-mails asking for method A, and only 1 asking for method B. That made the decison clear to them: they went ahead and implemented method A.<br>Rick Brewster on October 26, 2007 11:36 AM</p>"
