message: "<p>@John:  \"I'd hate to be a grunt on that team.\"<br>It sounds like the sort of team where no-one is allowed to get away with being \"just a grunt\" -- but instead people are empowered and allowed to bring about immediate change.<br>They back it up not with \"arrogance\" but with \"passing unit tests\". <br>No wait, I take it back. Phil's a poser ;-)</p>"
