message: "<blockquote><br>Luckily for us, our team had the agility to respond to a better design.<br></blockquote><p><br>No your team does not.  Your team has no such thing: in order to accomplish your task, you and the other guys who \"did the cowboy thing\" and \"coded the whole implementation, updated all the unit and web tests\".<br>You had to give up something in order to do this: you gave up your free time that night.  You called your wife to tell her you'd be late to dinner; given the progression of events that night, did you in fact make it to dinner at all?  How does she feel about that?  You have a child: how is he impacted by your failure to come home at a reasonable hour?  How is your Subtext Project affected?<br>Your team is not so \"agile\" in the business sense (I do not mean \"agile\" in the technical sense; this clearly is the case: you got away with making major design changes without, seemingly, doing documentation.  That's classic \"agile\" development: write the code and don't give a damn about whether anybody else ever has to maintain it) that you could not work on the changes you made that night during the next day instead.<br>In few other professional fields (law, medicine, and business at the level of senior/strategic management are exceptions) do people avail themselves of their work at the expense of their own personal well-being and the well-being of friends and family as we do in IT.  That said, I am not at all surprised that a Sr. Program Manager at MSFT would work such ridiculous hours (I have worked similar hours, and I think it's high-time we in IT assert our need for free time for our own purposes, whatever they may be)...<br>BTW, I agree that designs are rarely right the first time; that is why I am a TDDer (modified to include documentation, that is).  :-)</p>"
