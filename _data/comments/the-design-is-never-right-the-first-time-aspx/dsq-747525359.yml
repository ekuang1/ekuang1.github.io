message: "<p>It is OK that the design won't be right the first time, but it should   be good at the first time. <br>Explanation: the fact that you could change the implementation over night tells me that your initial design was very good. It is not that simple to change the design and the implementation so close to the deadline... I know some projects with such a bad design where you can't replace some code just like that, it will take at least a month to do it...</p>"
