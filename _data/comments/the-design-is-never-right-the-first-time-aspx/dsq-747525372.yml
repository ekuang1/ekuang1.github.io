message: <p>@thecaseforsanity You don't have the full context to make such accusations. I can't imagine any industry in which employees nver work a little later once in a while. This was a CHOICE we made in order to meet a preview deadline because we value the feedback. We didn't have to do it. We could've waited and got this code in the next iteration. This wasn't for a release product.<br>I think that's the key difference here from other cases of insane project schedules. We had a choice in this matter.<br>Also, I more than compensated by going home early the next few days. If anything, I've found Microsoft to be much more work-life balanced than almost anywhere I worked (except maybe Univision, but I was bored there). Partly because I've always worked at consulting companies or startups. ;)<br>Today for example, I have a softball game in the middle of the day, a Dr. appt for my son, and a soccer game in the evening. I won't be at work much today. :)</p>
