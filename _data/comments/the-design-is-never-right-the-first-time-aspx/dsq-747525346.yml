message: <p>Phil, your post made me think of the idea of code ownership.  Several years ago another team went through the same process (discussed the design to death, went ahead and implemented agreed upon solution).  The team lead thought of an arguably better way and in the spirit of "show, don't tell" re-implemented the solution overnight with another dev. This was about 3 days before the milestone release.  I was not on the team, but was sitting in a cubicle among them.  So next morning I watched all hell break loose, as some people (who implemented the original solution) could not deal with the fact that someone took their code ownership away.  To them, it was plain disrespect.  Within weeks the team was history, people simply could no longer work together.  <br>Anyway, I am glad your team was able to handle the change.</p>
