message: <p>Hehe. So many of us wanna know what feature and code got changed as a result of SG's "outbreak". Nice post Phil! It's good to hear about this, because so many of us deal with these problems but probably keep thinking it is not supposed to be like that. "One day I will nail that perfect design the first time, one day!" <br>Our team are building an application from scratch and swapped out the web UI with ASP.Net Mvc from webforms. We worked evenings and weekends and when we felt confident that Mvc was the way to go, we replaced the entire UI with Mvc. A somewhat design change. ;-)</p>
