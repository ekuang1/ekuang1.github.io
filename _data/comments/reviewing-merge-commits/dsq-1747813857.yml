message: <p>Any chance that GitHub's Commit view could be the equivalent of `git show` instead of showing all the changes of the merged branch? Maybe with a toggle at the top when people want the full view?</p><p>Right now, GitHub's own docs say to merge in order to resolve conflicts, but then that resulting merge commit is pretty useless as far as code review is concerned.</p>
