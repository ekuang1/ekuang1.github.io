message: <p>Excellent research. Hopefully you've already considered this, but it would be excellent to see a button in GitHub on multi-parent commits to switch to this --cc view. Even better, it sounds like a useful new "collapsed" default, such as the "uninteresting diff" collapses in ordinary commits.</p>
