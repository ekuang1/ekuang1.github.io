message: <p>6 years ago, after three years studying computer science, I stopped and started a law school. Why ? I was always considered as the last of the moron. Worse, I started to think myself that I was really bad, and falling into depression. Today, I realize, I'm really better than many programmers with 5 years of study and experience ... No regret.<br>"One thing I have found is that IT organisations are not family friendly at all", glass ceiling, as a certain level you just can't ask for part-time ... It's not different in other organisations.</p>
