message: <p>Thanks Phil, this is interesting post.<br>I worked as developer for 6-7 years but after that gradually I move to work as a QA Engineer,even being in QA that my team is a big team from 28 just 6 of us are women.As a woman I can say we like to solve problems and being creative and even works on long hours to get result but somehow in this Industry it plays the way that not showing openly welcome the women and count on them as brogrammers so it seems we need to work on that.</p>
