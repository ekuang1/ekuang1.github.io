message: '<p>Perhaps this explains it: "From 1984 to 2006, the number of women majoring in computer science dropped from 37% to 20% â€” just as the percentages of women were increasing steadily in all other fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, with the possible exception of physics."<br>Perhaps women shifted their choices to go into other fields?<br>Alos, we are continually told that women are significantly more "social" than men. Perhaps the stereotype of the developer being a non-social loner also has something to do with it.<br></p>'
