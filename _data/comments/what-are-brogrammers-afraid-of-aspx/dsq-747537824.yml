message: <p>"Programmers who don't understand what the fuss is all about are either too stupid to recognize that there is a problem or too stupid to realize that they're a part of it." - Kevin Pang<br>Or maybe we have actually never seen any evidence of this supposed bias? Of the approximately 50 technology professionals (programmers/DBAs) I have worked with directly in the last 7 years, in environments ranging from small ISV to medium sized hedge fund, approximately 8 were female. I have read Katie's article, and I can very confidently say that I never once heard any comment directed at any of the them that remotely resembled any of the examples she gave. And if anyone had ever made such a comment, they would have been ridiculed and ostracized by the other males before being fired. Now the analysts and traders at the hedge fund, THEY were sexist, and they showed it every day; and everyone else, including the programmers, were turned off by it. THAT is a culture that needs to deal with its sexism problem. Technology has nothing to worry about (not just in comparison, but period).<br>Does that mean that sexism is never exhibited in a technology setting? Of course not; sexism exists, and there will be times when a sexist also happens to be a programmer. But I simply see no evidence that it is an 'institutional' problem; if anything it is a cultural problem.<br>What I DO think we have a problem with is perception, as cpb, Brian, Abhinaba, and James pointed out. 'Programmer culture' makes the profession seem unappealing to many people, and I think it  strikes a particularly negative chord with women. If they don't start programming early, if they don't study technology in school, why is it surprising to so many people that they don't end up in a programming career? It is that perception (and possibly that reality) that we should be focusing our energy on changing, not this ephemeral 'bias'.<br>"...why is the attitude that we shouldnâ€™t do anything to increase the numbers of women and minorities in our industry still prevalent?" - Phil Haack<br>Maybe because we think that gender and race shouldn't matter? I do NOT think that attracting more women and minorities will help our industry. What will help is attracting the most qualified people, regardless of gender or race.<br>"I think when people ignore what's irrelevant for the job...and focus only on what's important, you'll naturally and without realizing it build a diverse team." - Rich Dudley<br>Very well said Rich.</p>
