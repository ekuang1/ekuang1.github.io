message: <p>"When only 20% of CS undergrads are women, then clearly this is a moot debate. The crux of the issue to ask what's going on at the high school and collegiate level that results in such a gender imbalance in CS enrollment? "  As a woman working in higher education in a CS related field, I cannot overemphasise the importance of this point.  Girls are still in many cases actively discouraged at a high school level from entering technical profession.</p>
