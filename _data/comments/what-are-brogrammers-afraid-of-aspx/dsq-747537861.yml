message: <p>Another female chiming in here:<br>I'm actually very curious about the open source number.  I've been moderately active on github with my own projects, but I've never really joined a team except at work.  In real life, I don't know any programmers who have committed substantial work to an open source project, and I wish I did! I'm not sure really how one goes about finding the right project and the right team to work with, or any team at all.<br>Most people just say that you should find a project you're passionate, pick a bug or feature, and then get coding.  And this works fine for my personal projects.  But usually the things that I'm passionate about for bigger group projects (such as adding HTML/ePub support to lilypond) seem giant, and I don't know who to talk with to find out whether that work would be appreciated by other developers or the community.  Because of the size of the effort, just jumping in seems like I could waste a lot of time, and it would be a terribly inefficient way to get ship projects. <br>I was talking to a coworker at work the other day and we discussed my strategy of merging lanes versus his.  He described himself as an alpha personality and said that if there's a quarter car's width available, he just noses right in with his giant suburban.  That seems preposterous to me, since I'm a polite and cautious driver who signals any cars nearby that look like they might let me in, and then patiently waits for a driving response (slowing down or speeding up in a manner the provides space) from a nearby vehicle that indicates acceptance before merging.<br>That's a vastly different strategy of going about things.  I can't speak for all women, maybe they feel more comfortable just jumping in and meeting people online and throwing out ideas.  (Maybe they  meet and chat on IRC?  I've never had an experience on IRC that indicated other developers in the room cared about my existence or participation in the project.)  It always feels like people in open source groups all know each other already, and I'm not sure how to introduce myself as someone worth investing a bit of time in, maybe in getting the build system working successfully, or even updating the documentation so that I can get the build system working myself (*cough* gnome *cough*).  I guess I feel like there should be some social buy-in ("Yeah, we could use some help!") from at least one team member before investing in a project via contributions.  <br>Well, that's why I haven't contributed much code.  Yet.  I'm working on it!</p>
