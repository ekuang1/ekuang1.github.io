message: <p>I agree that sexism at any level is bad, and where it's obvious (or at least, identified), we should take the necessary steps to reduce or eliminate it.<br>However, I do not agree with the mindset that we should actively encourage women and minorities to join the field strictly for the purpose of diversity. In fact, I cannot even fathom such a position. Doesn't that amount to some sort of voluntary affirmative action?<br>No, I believe that whoever wants to be a developer should be encouraged to, and given every opportunity, same as the next guy, but I don't buy into the idea of actively pursuing minority candidates for the sole purpose of increasing workforce diversity.<br></p>
