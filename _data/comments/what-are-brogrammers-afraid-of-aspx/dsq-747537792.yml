message: <p>I see it all the time, and unfortunately for all the times this topic comes up nothing ever really changes - but more and more awareness is always welcome.<br>Programming can definitely be a boys club and it's not even just in regards to women involvement, you see so much frat boy behaviour apart from that.<br>And part of it might just be because there are so few women involved they're seen as "different" and singled out.  Definitely not right, but hopefully something that will change.<br>Anyway, I know it's a plug, but as for OSS anyone is welcome to get involved in Code 52 (<a href="http://code52.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://code52.org/">http://code52.org/</a>) and if you have any problems with behaviour then we're happy to deal with it - we want everyone to feel welcome to contribute and welcome to be part of the group.<br>We've definitely noticed that, even though we've had a lot of offers, the ones that make it through to actual contribution is even fewer, and we haven't had much contribution or involvement by women as yet - and just from the point of view of wanting to do more, and get more involvement from the .NET community into Open Source, and especially first timers - we'd be more than happy to have the help, and to offer help.</p>
