message: <p>I should clarify my previous comment:<br>"Had it been a caucasian male, I probably wouldn't have even given it a 2nd thought had he had the same team dynamic problems."<br>What I meant by that is not that we should have hired a white male, but that if it had been a white male and we decided he wouldn't fit in, I wouldn't have had a 2nd thought about why we didn't hire him...I would have dismissed him as a candidate and not thought twice about it. The African-American female, we all thought twice about, simply for the sake of diversity. There were some very interesting conversations about her that we had behind closed doors that would have not otherwise been had.<br>I know this is a touchy subject, but our industry struggles with it...so why not air some dirty laundry and get it out in the open.</p>
