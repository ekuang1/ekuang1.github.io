message: <p>You are letting too many people off the hook by pinning sexism on "brogrammers". It's often not the more well-rounded types - those who enjoy gyms and clubs in addition to programming - who belittle female programmers. It's the insular, pale, basement-dwellers (figuratively or literally) who don't understand women because they are afraid to talk to them, and therefore don't see how they could possibly contribute useful code.</p>
