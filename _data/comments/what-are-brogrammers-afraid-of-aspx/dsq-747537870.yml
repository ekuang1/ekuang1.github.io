message: "<p>A very nice post indeed.. and starts quite a debate..<br>Belonging to the fairer sex myself, I have had my share of prejudices. This is because of the inane mindset \"guys\" have that \"girls can't program\", right along with the thinking \"girls can't drive\".<br>To quote an example: I remember when I wanted to participate in my first ever programming competition, a person from my class quite clearly said.. \"Umm.. a girl.. in a programming competition.. would she be able to, well, program?\"<br>Another instance was when a team of three girls (myself and two of my friends) visited another university for a programming competition. We were the only all-girls team, and once again, we heard a guy, flabbergasted at seeing us, asked \"All-girls team for a programming competition?\"<br>This and many other incidences of the sort may be the things that have driven me to work even harder and prove myself. But this may also be the thing that might have demotivated a few. <br>When you keep hearing people say that girls can't program out loud, you are bound to start believing them some day.<br>Once I graduated and started my very first job as a Software Engineer, I again faced the same kind of situations. The people in my team often didn't even call female programmers for interview, for the reason that they were female.<br>And then there is the hurdle for every lady's promotion. She's going to get married and eventually resign. Well to all those people who think on the same thread, here's a question: \"Do male programmers NEVER resign?\"<br>The only way the ratio as stated in the post can be changed is when people start changing their perspective, their thinking. When I see one bad male programmer, I don't decide that all male programmers must be bad. Female need the same kind of non-discriminating attitude from their male colleagues.<br>As for the part where I said the discriminating comments drove me to work even harder to prove myself.. that enthusiasm is wearing down.. slowly but still wearing down. I am getting tired of trying to prove myself at everything I do, just because of my gender. And I guess this is what happens with a lot of ladies.</p>"
