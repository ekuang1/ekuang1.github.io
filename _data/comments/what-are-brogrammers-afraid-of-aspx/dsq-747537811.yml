message: <p>Great post Phil.  <br>Brogrammers should be very, very afraid! This is one stereotype that needs to become extinct.<br>I'm shocked by some of the numbers you quote; knew number of women in the field was low, but didn't realize it has become so low. Curious to the percent of women on Stack Overflow, GitHub &amp; other major online forums? Be it perceived value, time commitments, personal privacy concerns, or other factors… we need to create communities that are more welcoming.<br>The bigger question is "why are brogrammers able to survive in the software industry?" To me the open display of disrespect is a sign the industry is not yet professionally mature. We as individuals need to insist on holding our peers to higher standards!<br>We also need to look beyond our peers to the general environments we work. Businesses tend toward rewarding  one-off fire fighters more so than quieter team enablers. Employee ranking systems and strange metrics can influence career choices to ones with better life balance. Working hours in a typical software shop may not be so flexible… not just on an individuals time, but to time demands of the business &amp; to demands of cross-timezones. <br>There may be no one-off solutions, but WE are definitly part of making solutions &amp; change happen. Take pride in speaking up and in doing your part to make our professional environments more diverse. Lose the losers and WE all WIN!<br>--Brian<br><br></p>
