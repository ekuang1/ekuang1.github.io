message: "<p>@Rich: More and more studies are showing that it's the diversity of  attitudes and views that has the benefit. If you compiled a team of diverse people who all think alike and are competent, you wouldn't do as well. Here's <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/mimssbits/27663/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/mimssbits/27663/\">another set of studies that back that up</a>.<br>@William when talking about \"institutionalized sexism\" we're talking about discrimination from a position of power. So while women can have sexist attitudes for men, industry wide, those attitudes have very little impact on men's day to day. Simply look around. How many female CEOs do you see? How many in the tech industry. How many execs in your company are men? When you have all the power, a sexist remark, while still unnacceptable, doesn't have any real power.<br>Also, it's not a 50-50 split because our industry is heavily skewed male.</p>"
