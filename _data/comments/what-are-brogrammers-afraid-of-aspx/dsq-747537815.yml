message: <p>What do I think? I think that any blog/news outlet/tweet that uses the phrase "brogrammer" is full of shit and just looking for page views to fill the dead space between iDevice speculation windows. Professionals (IE - the 99% of tech folk working at sexy news targets) really don't give a shit about the gender of the person in the cube next to us, as long as they write decent checkin comments. Just my opinion, of course.</p>
