message: <p>What I think? I think that the author quite underestimates the sexism existing in the industry. It's very common for a male programmer not to see it. The fact that THERE ARE STILL WOMEN IN THE INDUSTRY doesn't cancel the fact that THEY ARE BEING FORCED OUT. Those who have been already forced out, don't speak. So, they impression is, women that are still in the industry experience only subtle sexism (the rest who experienced more of it, quit). Come on, who needs more women "joining" the field, if the field is already losing them? <br>The numbers are, 52% of females quit STEM mid-career, while the number of males quitting the field is 17%. With the raise of brogramming, I would expect a further decrease of female and minority developers at all levels. I'm a female developer in mid-career and consider quitting myself. I got my share of sexism and hostility:<br>1. open source - the only group project I was able to participate in, was when I took a male name. Otherwise, I was either ignored or experienced direct hostility. I stopped contributing, and either develop something on my own or fork somebody's else project and develop what I need on the top. No more bros around, no problem. <br>2. Groups and public speaking - again, ignoring (taking as a "wife") and hostility. I was kicked out of a group after the organizer invited me to speak, but saw my (female) name and made up a totally bs excuse to kick me out. Nobody spoke for me. <br>3. marginalization at work - got assigned menial tasks and fixing things after "big balls" (because they are too geniuses to do it), was told off for petty reasons, excluded from decision making and meetings, no credits given for work, disrespect and abuse. I quit this job, but only to get stuck unemployed.  <br>4. With the recent rise of brogramming, rampant discrimination in hiring. My skills are in such demand, that I get recruiters contacting my profile on LinkedIn literary every day. Then I get 1-2 phone interviews, statements that I did great and "we will contact you" and then get "forgotten" in the process and they repost the job... (good chance not to *notice* discrimination, as it's a good chance not to notice some people ever applied). I look at the teams and they are all male (like 20-50 people), and almost all white of the same age, if they don't hire any diversity, there was no chance for me anyway. If I can't get a job anymore, it should be time to go, right?<br>The root of the problem, it takes only one sexist (misogynist, racist, big ego etc) guy for the whole team, and the rest of the team being passively supportive or not caring (but they are nice bros!), to make sexism and discrimination work. Nobody would ever "hear" anything bad, after all they would trust their bro rather then some "other". Been there. Especially with the management having conflict of interest - either I stand up against sexism or I piss off my brogrammers. Well, don't hire brogrammers then, hire employees. <br>Now somebody come, and tell me to lighten up... The whole discussion looks like a group of white people discussing racism - "Hey, white guys, what's racism, I've never seen it. What's a black person saying in this discussion?".</p>
