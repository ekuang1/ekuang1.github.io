message: <p>I find myself agreeing strongly with cpb.  I wouldn't deny that there is active and passive discrimination against women as well as general boorishness in the software industry, but I find it hard to believe that it is any higher than in other fields that women actually want to enter, for instance sales, where gender inequality is less prominent.<br>What makes the software culture hostile to women is our insistence on "passion" -- frankly an ability to be single-minded, compulsive and anti-social in the pursuit of a programming task -- as the quality most admired in a programmer.  We measure this passion in terms of time spent on open-source projects and conference attendence rather than on other pursuits like staying fit or reading a good book.<br>According to this Carnegie Mellon study of gender inequality in CS programs (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/2008-1082-833090.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://news.cnet.com/2008-1082-833090.html">http://news.cnet.com/2008-1082-833090.html</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/gendergap/www/intwomen.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/gendergap/www/intwomen.html">www.cs.cmu.edu/.../intwomen.html</a>) the culture of the "golden boy" is one women can't see themselves fitting into.  Women who pursue CS degrees see it as one of a spectrum of interests they hold and they generally want to integrate these interests.  In programmer culture, software is treated as if it should be an end in itself.  <br>I believe that a quota-based hiring system would indeed meliorate this situation.  If we make a point of hiring women programmers into good paying jobs and even pay them a premium over men in order to attract more women into the profession, this will dramatically shift programming culture in a positive way to be less of a hacker culture (no pun intended, Phil) and more of a professional 9-to-5 culture.<br>Alternatively, we can just do this ourselves without quotas in order to make programming more attractive for women.  Let's celebrate the fact that we have lives outside of programming.  Let's not congratulate coders for staying up all night programming or letting their health fail in order to push out a product.  Let's remind ourselves that not going to conferences and not blogging about technology and not giving public talks about coding is a likely sign that people have real lives and alternate interests.<br>Let's change our male dominated programming culture that, as a factual matter, is hostile to women by making these obvious changes to improve all our lives.</p>
