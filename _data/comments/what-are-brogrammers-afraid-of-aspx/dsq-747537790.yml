message: <p>I could tell you that there is hope. <br>First, I know a lot of ladies that took the <a href="http://codeacademy.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="codeacademy.com">codeacademy.com</a> challenge and may learn the trade, at least on a high level this year.<br>Second, it's easier nowadays to not only get into it, but get excited about coding - by way of blogs. From Tumblr to WordPress, I personally know females that took it upon themselves to learn HTML , CSS, and even dabble in some JS, originating from the desire to customize their sites and blogs.<br>They may not be CS majors, but it is a gateway to the back-end languages if the artform of "getting computers to do stuff" resonates with them.<br></p>
