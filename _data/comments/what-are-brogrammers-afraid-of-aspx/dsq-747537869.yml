message: "<blockquote>Maybe little girls just aren't as interested in computers and programming as little boys are? </blockquote><p><br>@Eric I don't get this argument. Do you suggest it's something innate in female brain - and that the females who are interested in computers are mutations or whatnot?<br>I personally (as a woman and a developer) think that the situation is much more along the lines of social conditioning which starts very early and reinforced by the education system. I myself was told by the school principal when I was 15 that \"girls don't need to study physics.\" Of course, since this was my first time meeting this kind of attitude it didn't make any impression on me (bless my parents for making zero difference in how they raised me and my brother.) But if a girl hears that stuff from early on, she wouldn't even consider CS (or other sciences) as a career choice. <br>There's another thing to consider: \"computer\" jobs are not perceived as family-friendly. (Long hours, etc. - doesn't matter if it's true or not.) And once again, girls and women make the choice against CS as they are the ones expected to \"raise the family\" when push comes to shove.</p>"
