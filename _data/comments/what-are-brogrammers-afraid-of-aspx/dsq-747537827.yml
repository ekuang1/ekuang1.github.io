message: <p>@Micah you are absolutely right. I used the term "Brogrammer" as a catch-all, but it's not entirely accurate. I'm sure many brogrammers are not part of the problem. And many non-brogrammers are part of the problem.<br>The reason I fixated on that term was some recent events advertised to "brogrammers" that also tried to feature women as objects. So it seemed a good focal point, but not the end all and be all.<br>And it made a catchier title too. :)</p>
