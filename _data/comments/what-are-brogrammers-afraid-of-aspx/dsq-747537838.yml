message: "<p>Interesting that the majority of the responses are defensively addressing the question of whether or not their job environment is diverse or should be.  When only 20% of CS undergrads are women, then clearly this is a moot debate.  The crux of the issue to ask what's going on at the high school and collegiate level that results in such a gender imbalance in CS enrollment?  Clearly there are cultural stereotypes at play, and to a degree there are some moments of hostility that any women in a male dominated environment will face (I call these the off-by-one problems: there's always some immature little *(&amp;% with offensive wallpaper on his classroom laptop), but my two cents is that if you want to attract women and other minorities into CS, you need to show that CS is not geekiness for geekiness' sake, but that the power of being able to build programs by hand also offers the power of being an agent of social change.  The CS program I followed (now six years stale) offered very little interdisciplinary outreach.  Like the stereotype of programmer who works in isolation, the CS program was an isolated path (save a few cross-over math courses).  Maybe that needs to change.</p>"
