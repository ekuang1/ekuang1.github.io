message: <p>Like many other women, I've worked as a Programmer for quite a few years and have experienced sexism.  I've also experienced the whole "boys club" in unlikely positions I've held.  No, I don't want to be a UI person, or get pegged into working with CSS or photoshop or be a Business Anaylst.  I am a core developer.  I may not have as much time after work to learn everything I can get my hands on - but I do my part and LOVE programming.  I often look for places I can chat or connect with other female Programmers going through the same situations as me, but there aren't many professional organizations for someone like me.  I have one other female programmer buddy.  I also go to events that get women into STEM technologies..but haven't been to one yet that focuses on Programming and Technology.<br>I think at the end of the day though - if you can prove yourself and your technical talent, you will earn the respect of your peers.  And if you can't earn that respect, then work with it or find another job where you can. They do exist.<br>The guy (@Brandon) that mentioned the thought of having to behave a bit more around women...  yeah, I have seen and heard that too.  I know that many men get over this and appreciate the beauty and brains of their female coworker and focus on the code that THEY love instead of the person sitting next to them.</p>
