message: <p>The change is based on my observations over a handful of recent technical conferences and meet ups (in India). I won't go in to details to save a long post but the few women who were there felt completely out of place and alienated. When one feels like an outsider in an event related to their own field it can be a pretty discouraging and spirit dampening experience I think.</p><p>I think out going and extroverted women can still thrive in the current scenario. But the fact that most geeks generally tend to be socially shy and introverted makes it a real problem for the majority of women.</p><p>I think the cause of the problem is not really sexism but a general lack of empathy. I will be doing whatever little I can to improve this situation and the first step in this direction was to ensure that everyone I had agreed with and argued against in the past on this topic knows that my earlier perceptions were off the mark.</p><p>This post was one of the triggers that lead to the change, so thanks for that :)</p>
