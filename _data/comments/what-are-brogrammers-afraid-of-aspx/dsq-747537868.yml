message: <p>Maybe women just aren't interested in programming?<br>I went to college 10+ years ago during the last dotcom boom/bust and there was less than 1% females in every single programming class.  And if they were female, they weren't white.  Maybe white women don't have any interest in programming?  I certainly don't remember any guidance counselors preventing them from enrolling in the degree or telling them a woman couldn't operate a keyboard or click a mouse.<br>Why do people keep inventing problems?  Are we really going to be sexist and say something cliched like "programming is missing out because women would bring something special because they're able to juggle childbirth and baking cupcakes!"?<br>Maybe little girls just aren't as interested in computers and programming as little boys are?  Every single class I had in high school or college was 1% or less of girls.  No one EVER tried to exclude them.  Hell, the boys always wanted more geek girls who were into computers.<br>Just about anyone can program a computer. Someday only robots will be employed as programmers.</p>
