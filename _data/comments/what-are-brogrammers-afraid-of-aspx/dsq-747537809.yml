message: <p>It's sad that we have to waste cycles on something that is such a waste.  This is not what I want my adorable little girl to face, but she'll come prepared should she face it.<br>There is one thing that concerns me here.  It is the issue of a diverse workforce being more productive.  Several other people touched on this.  I think diversity is an effect, not a cause here.  I think when people ignore what's irrelevant for the job (race, religion, age, gender, whatever) and focus only on what's important, you'll naturally and without realizing it build a diverse team.  I bet if you pointed out the diversity of the team to most of the diverse teams, it would come as something of a surprise.  I doubt they give it much thought.  There is too much camaraderie and pride to notice the unimportant.  If they do notice it, they probably appreciate the differences in one another.<br>My fear is, the focus will be on building a diverse workforce thinking that will bring competence, rather than focusing on what is required to do the job and letting the diversity chips fall where they may.  The exception being, maybe instead of "why is a manhole cover round" questions, we perhaps need to concoct a scenario where we can see if the guy is a neanderthal, and not hire those guys.</p>
