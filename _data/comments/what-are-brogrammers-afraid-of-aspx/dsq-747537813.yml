message: <p>I'm from the Netherlands and around here, I don't experience any discrimination. In fact I've been involved in hiring numerous developers and one of the best I hired was a women.<br>My personal list of things to look for are technical skills, communication skills and cultural fit (not what culture someone is from, but will this person fit in our team and how will this person affect our culture). I don't care about gender, rase or age (although I do have some though questions for you if you've been programming for the past 30 years and are still a medior programmer). In fact, if I would take a poll amongst my co-workers right now, I'm convinced I would have a 100% score on hiring more women. I just don't get any resumes from women.<br>I agree with the notion that our industry has a bad reputation as to what type of people work in it. I also feel that, besides having the neccesary technical skills, you need to have social and communication skills. They make the difference between a decent programmer and a great one.<br>As for your explenation on what would actually happen if more talent would arive (the talent being female or not), I completely agree it would wash out the bad programmers (this is a problem if you have imposter syndrom).</p>
