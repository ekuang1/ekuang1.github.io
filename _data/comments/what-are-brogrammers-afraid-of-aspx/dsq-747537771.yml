message: <p>Fantastic post, Phil. As for your question as to what brogrammers are afraid of, I think Hanlon's razor sums it up quite nicely:<br></p><blockquote>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.</blockquote><p><br>In other words, I don't think there's some grand scheme to keep women out of the industry. I think it simply boils down to this:<br><strong>Programmers who don't understand what the fuss is all about are either too stupid to recognize that there is a problem or too stupid to realize that they're a part of it.</strong> They need to grow up and learn to behave like adults, at least in the workplace if not in their day-to-day lives.</p>
