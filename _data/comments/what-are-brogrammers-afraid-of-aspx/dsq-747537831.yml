message: "<p>The transition is easy to understand, if you lived through it.  I did, the tail end, anyway.  My mother was a \"programmer\" around 1950.  At the time, this meant inserting, by rule, jumpers into patch panels (look it up).  Once languages, other than machine or basic assembler, came to be, the profession continued along similar lines.  That is, the EE who told Mom what to do morphed into an \"analyst\" (who was likely trained in EE) who provided pseudo-code to the FlowMatic or AutoCoder programmer.  This person, who needed to be detail oriented to translate the pseudo into \"real code\", tended to be female, just as lace makers and other \"detail oriented\" workers dating back to the beginning of industrialization in the 19th century.<br>What motivated today's structure was the creation of CS curricula (starting, IIRC, with Carnegie Tech in the mid 1960s).  With this change, software, soup to nuts, moved from real engineer and coder to one-man-band non-engineers.  For those who were there:  CS was created to satisfy those who couldn't cut it in a DiffEq class and such, but still demanded to be a part of this exciting computer industry.  Carnegie, The Institute, and such were barely co-ed (if that much) at the time, so the girls were shut out from the start.  The boys' club came to be, and it persists still.<br></p>"
