message: <p>If you are using "team fit" as your excuse for discrimination then it is time to completely change the shape of your team. There are many experienced women developers out here in the cold. Every time you shut the door you drive us away from the ever growing, ever changing skill sets required.<br>I believe smart young women are seeing it as the no-win situation it usually is now. Older women, who have invested themselves in the industry are less able to walk away from the role they'd love to be able to continue.<br>If you have driven someone out, then you need to make sure you engage with them in a non critical, enabling way when they come back in. You need to have good on-boarding. You need to leave space in your schedule to on-board properly and adjust the bridging skillsets. You need to not leave them stuck in a corner without contact. This affects all developers. <br>You need to not advertise for rockstar gods. It gives people an inflated sense of their own importance and ability. We are engineers. A clever and conscientious engineer will not want to fit in with a team of egotistical and error-prone children.<br></p>
