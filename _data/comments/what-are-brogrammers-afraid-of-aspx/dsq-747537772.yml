message: <p>Personally, within Australia (Melbourne at least) I don't believe there is institutionalised sexism within the IT industry. Having sat on a few interview panels and had plenty of discussions on hiring policies, I have never come across the situation where anyone has ever been acting in way that they are thinking "she's great, but gee if only it was a bloke". Race, religion and sex just don't come into the equation, all we care about is communication skils, being passionate about programming, and your (potential) coding skills! In the music industry, that's another matter - you wouldn't believe some of the stuff I've heard. <br>Personally I would love to hear any stories from women (or anyone who isn't a white male aged 25-35) who purposely chose to not go into IT because of perceived descrimination. I actually think that ageism is a far bigger problem within IT.<br></p>
