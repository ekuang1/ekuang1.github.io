message: <p>What often goes unmentioned in this debate is the poor understanding and perception of programmers from those outside IT.<br>The problem is not that there is a lot of girls struggling to get into the IT industry. The problem is that girls are not signing up for CS courses at all (in fact, at least in Australia, a shortage of computer science enrollments is a general problem for boys and girls). Now remember that people we choose our university courses when we are only 17 or 18 years old.<br>The perception from outside IT is that programmers are socially inept, strange, ugly, outsiders with magical skills that can only be acquired through long periods spent in dark basements.<br>Things like 'brogrammers' are trying to break this stereotype, and if they are successful, they may actually encourage more people to enroll in CS courses. Movies like the Social Network and Girl with a Dragon Tattoo, and having prominent computing celebrities who are not ultra-nerds (think Steve Jobs vs Bill Gates), may also start to change the perception of programmers by at least humanizing the industry a bit.</p>
