message: <p>Although I think it's good to support diversity, in the end the company will choose the best person suited for the job, and the future employee will choose the best offer.<br>Today globalization provides a bigger pool of experts and companies in search for those people. So not only that a company chooses its employees, but also people have the choice to become employees in a certain company.<br>Although, I acknowledge that there aren't too many girls in the IT / programming field, I can't say that i've been discriminated, or that I know such an example.<br></p>
