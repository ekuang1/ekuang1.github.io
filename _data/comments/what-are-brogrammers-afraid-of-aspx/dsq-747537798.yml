message: <p>From what I (white male, so I have bias and blindness) see there is a belief in our culture, popular and otherwise, that programming is a solitary pursuit about individual prowess.  I even met a handyman recently who dropped out of CS because it was all about being alone.  Think about any dysfunctional programmer or dev team you know and that's the reason.  This myth attracts people who are self involved, lack empathy, and are actively anti-social and proud of it.  If more people were aware of development (as I and my coworkers practice it, at least) as a team effort where communication and empathy are as important as intellect and creativity, we might cast a wider net as an industry.   And further more, we need to seed this opinion when people are kids.<br>Racism and sexism are nasty, but I think they are only the most visible of the real problem.  Fix that, and a more diverse crowd will see what we see in this, the best damn career out there.</p>
