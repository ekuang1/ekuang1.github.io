message: <p>Why are people so quick to assume that any statistical imbalance is the result of sexism or racism? There may be a statistical imbalance regarding gender among software developers, but it's nothing compared to the statistical imbalance regarding gender in another context. Can you think of even ONE situation comedy TV show or ONE commercial where the male is NOT portrayed as less intelligent, less sophisticated, less ambitious, less sympathetic, and less reasonable than the female? The vast majority (if not all) of such programming portrays females more favorably. Why?<br></p>
