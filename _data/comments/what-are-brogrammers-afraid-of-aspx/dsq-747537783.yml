message: <p>The truth is that the problem is bigger than this and covers the whole area of discrimination in software industry that is just like any other industry. In fact, a friend and I suggested to Hanselman and Conery to have a This Developer's Life on discrimination in software but I guess they didn't want to do that.<br>If you look around, you see that there is a frustrating discrimination for very old and very young people in software. As a young person who was actively involved in this industry at the age of 19, this discrimination killed many opportunities in my career and future. Likewise, I have older friends who always tell me how their age is a problem.<br>There is also the problem of nationality. Like many other industries, software is not open to many nationalities.<br>It's also about academic education, degrees, and even where you get your degree from. There is a very frustrating discrimination in there as well.<br>And yes, sexism is yet another aspect of discrimination in software, but it's not the only one. In order to solve this problem, we have to wipe out discrimination from this industry IMO.</p>
