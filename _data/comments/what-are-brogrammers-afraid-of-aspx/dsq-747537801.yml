message: <p>The whole problem is the image we have created of this profession. Just like scientists wear white lab coats, programmers are beer+cola drinking nerds with beards. They are anti-social and lack the essential skills to communicate.<br>I have a 8 year old girl who is already a "maker" and loves tinkering with stuff, yet already knows that only "geeks" who don't have many friends work on computers. Sad but true.<br>"You must be the change you want to see in the world" so lets start by changing the perception one at a time</p>
