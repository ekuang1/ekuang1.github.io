message: <p>I find these figures really surprising - how do we get from here to a situation where people actually don't need to collect statistics because there just isn't a problem any more as anyone can do any job if they have the skills to do it?<br>Having seen the arguments this week, I worry that the more we highlight this as a problem the harder it gets to solve it - but we can't exactly ignore it either.<br>I guess I need to hear some suggestions about what can be done (other than the obvious answer of not pitching women as beer-fetchers or sexy t-shirt models).</p>
