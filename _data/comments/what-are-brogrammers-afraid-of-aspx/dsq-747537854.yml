message: <p>As a woman with over 30 years in the IT arena, I have experienced  discrimination (sexism) both in salary (making 20% less that the male colleague who kept coming to me with his basic questions...) and more directly as boorish commentary.  I have also worked for companies that worked to alleviate discrimination in both of those areas.  I could have left many times to pursue other careers, but I happen to like solving problems and creating solutions so I "educated" the boorish and kicked a little butt (metaphorically speaking) when necessary.  I prefer to work as part of a team, because my experience has been that the best, most robust solutions are created in a team environment (regardless of the many fine, robust solutions I created solo).  The more diverse, the better, and since my current company values diversity I get to work with a lot of really great people from various backgrounds.<br>As several people have already mentioned, the cause starts much earlier than the interview for a CS position (or conference, or blog comment, or whatever).  Girls are often discouraged from pursuing careers that are seen as "technical" - including scientific or lab work.  I excelled at math, and in junior high was taking algebra a year ahead of my peers.  In high school I was a teachers assistant for one of the science teachers for three of the four years I was there.  So why did the school counselors try to steer me away from math and science, towards more "womanly pursuits" such as secretary or nurse?  Lucky for me that I follow my own advice much more often than the advice of others - especially when the advice is that divorced from reality.<br>Fortunately these outdated ideas are changing, but in the USA that change is slow - in part because our society still has large numbers of people who insist on perpetrating those views on the rest of us.  I cannot tell you how many times I have heard those "women belong in the kitchen" remarks.  And not just in this industry, mind you, but yes on occasion from colleagues.  But more often I saw colleagues take a stand against that sort of bias.<br>I do not necessarily agree that our industry as a whole has a bias, though certain narrow areas definitely do (I have not looked at pay-grade issues recently, but last time I did there was still disparity between genders).  But I certainly do agree that whenever we witness a bias, we should speak out and shine some light on it.  There is a good chance it will shrivel up and die when exposed.  And even if it doesn't, at least the person taking the brunt of the foolishness knows they are not alone and that others around them disagree.<br>Thanks, Phil, for writing about this.  I hope your daughter has a better experience than many of us have had, and is valued for what she is capable of rather than limited by stale ideas of "what should be".<br></p>
