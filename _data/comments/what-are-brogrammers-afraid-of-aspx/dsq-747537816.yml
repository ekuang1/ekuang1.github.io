message: <p>There has to be something to the fact that girls don't choose to go into programming at the same rate boys do. I can remember maybe one or two female classmates while getting my degree. Some of my MIS courses had more women in them but they were never computer science majors always management information science. The pure CIS class never had any women. <br><br></p>
