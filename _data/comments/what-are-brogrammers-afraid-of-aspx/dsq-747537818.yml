message: "<p>First of all, I think this is largely an American problem.  From what I've seen of Chinese, Russian and India developers, they are far more gender-balanced.  But finding an American-born female developer is rare.<br>And I think this is based on different motivation for entering engineering related fields. From what I've seen, Men do it due to an obsessive love of the field.  Women seem to do it because it a good career.  This is supported by the facts in Phil's post: Contributing to OSS for free requires love to the subject more that career interest, and women studying CS started to decline when developers started to become a commodity.</p>"
