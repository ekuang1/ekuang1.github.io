message: "<p>I find it amusing that one of the things that puts women off the profession is the \"nerdy, creepy guys\"... where are the nerdy, creepy women - surely they can be \"one of us\"?<br>I'm liking this conversation for pointing out all the ways I've been sort of oblivious to the minor, subtle ways that things can be taken even though I know even the jokes can get to you over time.<br>@Sharon I completely get where you're coming from - a couple of years ago I was so \"how do I open source?\", I was looking for small projects I could do by myself, I wasn't sure how I'd play with others, or how we'd get along.<br>I've seen people put off contributing to OSS by people that are really hard to get along with (and occasionally have been difficult to deal with, some days are like that).<br>But to be honest, I think, even if you're not communicating fully, that finding a project you like, that you're interested in, and that you can see something you can do - something small: add a small feature, fix a bug.<br>It doesn't hurt to try and submit it, and if it gets accepted it feels AWESOME.<br>If it doesn't, then just write them off as something that can't be helped - if it's github and you've forked it then you still get the benefit of your changes! :)<br>And if they ask you to change something, take it as constructive feedback and try to learn - sometimes they may be wrong, but it's their project.<br>Hopefully larger projects have guidelines on how they take requests, but if they don't - a quick tweet or email off to one of the heads usually will get you some information on how open they are - if they're helpful and open then you'll be more encouraged, if they're not then you move on.<br>To some degree it's hard to care a lot about people who promise or enquire about joining a project because so many of them immediately find they don't have the time, maybe it's a reaction to how they were received, but I'd hope that we were fairly friendly.<br>I've found that if you are talking in a chat to developers in a group, they really do warm up if you're around, friendly, and /really/ friendly once you've contributed and become one of the team.<br>The people who sit around suggesting ways the team should be doing things, instead of helping the team do things? Not so much.<br>If you are looking - then feel free to join any of ours, we'd be happy and lucky to have more help and maybe in amongst our projects you'd find something to interest you (or come in and suggest something that interests you) - <a href=\"http://code52.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://code52.org/\">http://code52.org/</a><br>@aimstress I get the \"being ignored and having someone else suggest the exact same thing\".  And I think it's more to do with communication skills, or lack there of, and the amount of respect, timing, approach, and a lot of things.<br>I think a lot of what you said is more about communication and hopefully not sexism, but just we are in a profession where a lot of non-communicators seem to get accepted, seem to be attracted to, and often get excused for their lack of communication skills.<br>I try to work on that, at least for myself.<br>I also have the commute and totally empathise, OSS can either be a quick jump in, do something and jump out, or like any problem solving can take your time.<br>You can only make the time you have, and you can't sacrifice your life to it.<br>But.  Having done it, I've learnt so much, more than I would have trying to find time to read a book on a topic, when sometimes books don't keep up with software these days - and I've had friends who have helped a tonne with teaching me things, pointing me in the right direction for solutions.<br>It is changing rapidly, and sometimes software is more about getting things done the way you know how, than keeping up with every new shiny thing that comes out - no matter how much your co-workers/twitter loves them.  If it's important then you'd manage to find the time, or you'd be learning it for work.</p>"
