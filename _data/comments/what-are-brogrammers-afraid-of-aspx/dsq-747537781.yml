message: <blockquote>Iâ€™ve tried my best to cajole some to contribute</blockquote><p><br>I think this is one of those moments where trying to help actually makes things worse. We are talking about equal rights/opportunities, not trying to cajole more women into tech because the sausage party is getting boring. Probably the only case where ignorance (of gender) is the best course.</p>
