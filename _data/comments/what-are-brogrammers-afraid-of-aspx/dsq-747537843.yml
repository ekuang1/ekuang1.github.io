message: <p>Phil, have you considered the topic of sexism from the opposite direction? As a programmer, you know what kind of odd-ball lot the typical group of (male) programmers are... why would any sane, self-confident woman want to voluntarily select a career where she would work 8+ hours a day around stereotypical programmers?  As guys, we're drawn to programming because of the intellectual challenge, the mental rigor, the technical creativity... and it doesn't phase us that we and our colleagues are, well, nerds.  Why are we surprised that women aren't flocking to join this profession?  A much more interesting study would be to examine (and explain?) why women left the field in the first place.  My guess is because the typical, dorky, programmer types gravitated to the field and the women were repulsed.</p>
