message: <p>Thankfully I have not yet encountered this legion of brogrammers. But despite the comments above insinuating that women are somehow whiners, or fundamentally different, the reasons are entirely cultural. As stated before computing wasn't always seen as a man's arena, and there were more women in the computing industry in the past. It has been on a steady decline. Given this you have to ask "Why?" Not to mention that women consistently cite "hostile workplace" as a reason why they do not enter the tech field or why they leave it. To counter this problem it will take a critical mass of women to enter the field. Unfortunately, unless we improve our tech and science education from K-12, we will never be able to achieve that.</p>
