message: <p>I know that when I was in school, there were TWO (count 'em folks) ladies in the CS field that graduated with me.  In that same class were 25-30 males.<br>When I got into the work force, though, I was shocked.  My individual department is overwhelmingly male (unanimously, even) but the company I work for as a whole is pretty darn near the 50/50 mark for male/female developers.  <br>Even among my friends in town, they generally think that all "tech geeks" are guys...which is unfortunately true in my peer group, but certainly not the case in my workplace.</p>
