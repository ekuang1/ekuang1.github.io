message: <p>I've not encountered any of this brogrammer stuff, but then I work mostly with corporate customers and not many startups.<br>You aren't going to get into corporate IT these days.  The entry level positions have all been farmed out to off shore companies.  It's high stress and very little reward outside money.  Many of the best people I've worked with have abandoned IT for other work.<br>So absent a career path of entry level, and people leaving the industry... there's not many of us left with experience.<br>It pays well, but there's less "good" work out there.  It's mostly just cleaning up.<br>Given this environment, I don't see why any women would want to work in it.</p>
