message: <p>Hey Phil!<br>Nice post! The fact that a diverse workforce is critical in today's global economy for your business to succeed is one of the best reasons to try to obtain and keep females in software. So +1 to that!<br>I addressed the hostile male culture and sexism in this post <a href="http://rachelappel.com/stats-data-and-answers-as-to-why-there-are-so-few-women-in-technology-fields/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://rachelappel.com/stats-data-and-answers-as-to-why-there-are-so-few-women-in-technology-fields/">rachelappel.com</a> in case you are interested (I've done quite a bit of research in this area). <br>-Rach<br></p>
