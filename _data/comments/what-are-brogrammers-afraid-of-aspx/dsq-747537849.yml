message: "<p>I must admit it's always interesting for me reading posts to articles on this topic. Speaking as a female who has been developing web and database applications for almost 2 decades there were several points made that I'd like to focus on as food for thought, if I may...</p><p> <br></p><blockquote>The general consensus was that she wouldn't \"fit in\" even though I thought she was qualified (but agreed that she wasn't a good team fit)...so when do the lines blur between pure talent, but also putting personality into the dynamic?</blockquote><p><br></p><p>@Jayson Knight: On the surface your observation is sound. I agree that choosing talent that is competent but also \"plays well with others\" is good, but I encourage you to look a little deeper at the \"dynamic\" being perpetuated by the decision you describe, and be open to considering that changing that dynamic may not be all bad?</p><p><br></p><blockquote>As guys, we're drawn to programming because of the intellectual challenge, the mental rigor, the technical creativity...</blockquote><p><br></p><p>@CMike: Interesting observation -- no, need something stronger, WTF! What makes you think that \"as females\" we wouldn't be interested in those same aspects? I know those things are exactly why I do what I do!</p><p><br></p><blockquote>...my two cents is that if you want to attract women and other minorities into CS, you need to show that CS is not geekiness for geekiness' sake, but that the power of being able to build programs by hand also offers the power of being an agent of social change.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>@sondra: Here, here!! Cudos for saying it.</p><p><br></p><blockquote>I have seen folks rejected in interviews because they indicated they expected some respect of their personal time... want nothing to do with it because \"who wants that aggravation?\"</blockquote><p><br></p><p>@Stacey: Excellent observation. I have seen the same thing as well. Heaven forbid that someone (regardless of race, sex or other attribute) may want to maintain some work/life balance, regardless of whether they have children or not. I do not have children but that does not mean I don't have a life outside of work as well.</p><p><br></p><p>@All: Keep up the good discussion folks, self-awareness is the first step toward change.</p>"
