message: <p>My thoughts have always been that the feeder programs into IT (e.g. colleges, trade schools, etc) are also male dominated, therefore it would make sense that just by simple math, our industry is going to be more male dominated. I have a few female friends who are changing careers and getting degrees in Comp Sci, and they are sometimes the only female in the entire classroom. This probably has the effect of becoming a vicious cycle...women get into computer programs, see that it's a boy's club, and say "forget it"...and go on to something else.<br>That all being said, I don't think hiring diversely just for the sake of diversity fixes anything; it actually would compound the issue IMO. I will say this, I worked for a company, and we interviewed a very nice, intelligent African-American woman for a networking engineer position. The general consensus was that she wouldn't "fit in" even though I thought she was qualified (but agreed that she wasn't a good team fit)...so when do the lines blur between pure talent, but also putting personality into the dynamic? Had it been a caucasian male, I probably wouldn't have even given it a 2nd thought had he had the same team dynamic problems.<br>Just some food for thought. Great post Phil.</p>
