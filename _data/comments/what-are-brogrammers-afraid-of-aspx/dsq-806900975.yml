message: <p>Phil, I was wrong. Some recent events have made me realize that. I don't have anything to say about racism in the industry since I haven't faced it personally but I have come to realize that the current environment in tech is not really very welcoming towards female geeks.<br>I was probably a bit harsh in the earlier comment, my apologies for that.</p>
