message: <p>Great comments folks! For those asking about more stories, just look around. There's <a href="http://storify.com/charlesarthur/oh-hai-sexism" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://storify.com/charlesarthur/oh-hai-sexism">a lot</a> <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2012/03/how-casual-sexism-put-sqoot-in.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2012/03/how-casual-sexism-put-sqoot-in.php">out there</a>.<br>As for encouraging women and minorities, why not? Don&amp;#8217;t we do a lot to encourage white males already? Craig nails the point I was making (emphasis mine):<br></p><blockquote><br>Chris V, I think it is wrong to promote unqualified or less skilled candidates for reasons of diversity. <strong>But there are many women and minorities who could be great developers if only they knew what a great industry it is and are not scared off by incumbents.</strong> That's the point.</blockquote><p><br>@cpb I&amp;#89217;m not sure trading one stereotype for another is helping anything. Just look at the recent <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2012/03/how-casual-sexism-put-sqoot-in.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2012/03/how-casual-sexism-put-sqoot-in.php">Sqoot debacle</a>. Is that making software development more interesting to women?<br>But I do agree with your point that we probably need to really focus hard on the perception problem. That&amp;#8217;s a great insight! I think there&amp;#8217;s two aspects of it. Show software to be a social activity taken up by normal interesting people and create a culture of respect.<br>@Brian great insight! Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s so sad because that myth is so far from the truth. Great software is built by teams. Software creation is a social activity!<br></p>
