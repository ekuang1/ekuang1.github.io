message: <p>If there actually was inequality then everyone who raises a voice against it is a hero. The question here is if there is inequality and that cannot simply be explained from statistics. NBA players are overwhelmingly black so does it mean that NBA is racist to whites? I don't remember the last time a non-black person won the 100m, racism again?<br>Please send me contacts of those women who would develop my applications for 70% of the cost of an all male developer team, I would hire them in a second and beat my competitors on cost. Heck, for a 30% reduction in cost I would hire monkeys if they could code just as well. In a capitalist economy any company that cares about factors other than skill when hiring people will go eventually  go bankrupt. I come from a country that has unbelievable amount of diversity in terms of language, caste, skin color, religion and so on. Group-ism and favoritism based on these factors was common place until quite recently and that continues to be the case in lesser educated regions. But the place where none of these factors even come in to play is in hiring talent, I can vouch for that from my personal experience in different parts of the country for more than 7 years. Finding good talent is so hard especially because so many leave to more developed countries that nobody cares about the other factors. If you claim that silicon valley recruiters favor these factors more than merit, then that puts them beneath their peers in the country where Slumdog Millionare was shot, I find that hard to believe.<br>When I said fighters and doers don't waste time commenting, I did not mean 10 minutes spent on commenting on a blog or even writing a blog entry like you have done. I am talking about those people who spend excessive amounts on time and energy on speaking at events and so on where they blame the lack of women in tech simply on white males. They  are the whiners.<br>I was expecting some reaction on the other points I made on my earlier comments but it is sad that you only chose to respond to the more trivial sections of my comment.</p>
