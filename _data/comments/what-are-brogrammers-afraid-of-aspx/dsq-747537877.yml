message: <p>@Kumar, so you're suggesting that those who speak out against inequality are sissies and whiners? Ghandi? Whiner. Martin Luther King Jr.? Sissy. Susan B Anthony? Victim.<br>Where did I call these folks "Powerless Victims"? No, the very fact that we're talking about this is because people are raising their voice.<br></p><blockquote><br>...because the fighters and doers are too busy actually doing something to even comment on topics as silly as 'brogrammers'.<br></blockquote><p><br>And yet, here you are, commenting on this topic.<br>Does the fact that you took the time to comment mean you're not actually doing something? Of course not! So why would you say the same about those who want to fight against inequality? Such folks can still be <em>doing something</em> while at the same time they speak out against inequality.<br>If you made $0.70 for every dollar that someone of equal skill to you makes just because you're a woman, then I wouldn't consider it whining to demand a change. You can do that at the same time as you continue to do productive work.</p>
