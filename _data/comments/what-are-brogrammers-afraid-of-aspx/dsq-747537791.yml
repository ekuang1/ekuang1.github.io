message: <p>I have to agree with Keyvan as well - there is a lot of discrimination. I also started professionally working in the industry at 19 and a lot of <strike>guys</strike> people can't live with the fact I have as much experience as them at 2/3 of their age.<br>And don't start me on the racism - Indian developer is an insult around here...<br>It's a huge problem, but it's a problem with society as a whole, not only tech.</p>
