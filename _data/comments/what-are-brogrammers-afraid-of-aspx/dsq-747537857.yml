message: "<p>@CMike: Thanks for responding. Your local poll yields a rather humorous (to me) perspective -- \"they aren't interested in being colleagues with the stereotypical programmer (too nerdy, too creepy, too anal-retentive)\". The majority of programmers I know, while somewhat nerdy and rather *ahem* detail-oriented, are far from being what I consider creepy; a little misunderstood perhaps, but not creepy.<br>Your summary just reinforces for me that stereotypes somehow seem to be perpetuated in all aspects of life. We all have our quirks and qualities, they make us unique (something to be valued, not supressed, IMHO).</p>"
