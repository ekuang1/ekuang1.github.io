message: <p>I am a female programmer, having worked in several areas of IT from tech support to management for over a decade and a half, but my love will always be programming. I have also been an avid DIYer for many years, lately the large project being a house renovation (and no, that doesn't just mean throwing some paint on the walls). I thrive on "there's a hurdle - figure out how to fix it or make it better".<br>I can't count the number of times I have been spoken to as if I were a child. This may just be the communication styles of people who generally tend to talk down to others, so take that as you will... though I'd have to add that most of those same people didn't ever talk to their male colleagues like that. I also can't count the number of times I've sat through meetings and had comments and ideas ignored only to have a male colleague say the same thing later and congratulated for the contribution.  Perhaps the latter stems from my personal communication style (or lack thereof) which doesn't match the group. Or maybe it's that I'm a woman and the man was taken seriously. It's hard to say. We as people tend to gravitate toward things that are comfortable. We also understand better when we are told things in a way that matches how we learn. Boys and girls tend to have different communication and learning styles, so the perpetuation of male dominance will continue until we as a whole figure out how to shift it. But how do you fix something that is really chicken and egg? In order to get more girls, have more women teaching/mentoring.. but where do the women come from? There are so few of us, and we're so busy....<br>On top of the general "sexism" problem, there is the problem of life outside of work. As I've mentioned before, I have a house, but I also have a family. At the end of the day, including the hour commute (to keep the kids from having to move) and x hours of work, there's dinner and family time, house maintenance, and not much left over for brushing up on skills or diving into an open source project in that hour before I crash in bed. How do I help foster the future when I can barely keep up with my job? And what if your response is "then you are in over your head at your job"?</p>
