message: <p>Honestly, I think men enjoy being pigs/vulgar when in the 'zone'. And their are women around, men may feel they have to restrain themselves and shower. Women seem to become a distraction for the best of best programmers and maybe it became easier to shun them instead of fighting over them.</p>
