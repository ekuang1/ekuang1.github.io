message: <p>Interesting numbers Phil but you would have to delve deeper than mere numbers and stats to understand the real issues.<br>I am an Indian male living in India, still in his 20s and a self-taught programmer. I am amazed to see that a lot of these 'good guys' speak of women and minorities as perpetual powerless victims, they are not! It is insulting, please stop it!<br>Every race and gender has its fair share of tough ones, sissies, whiners, doers, victims, fighters etc. The voices you most often hear when it comes to topics like these are those of the whiners, because the fighters and doers are too busy actually doing something to even comment on topics as silly as 'brogrammers'.<br>It is the easiest thing in the world to say something that is politically correct but it takes a lot of integrity and courage to speak your mind when that means having to offend some people and perceptions and more importantly not being politically correct.<br>You speak of decreasing percentages of Hispanics and Blacks but can you look at what has been happening to the percentage of Asians in the same sector during the same time. Are white males less racist to Asians than they are to Blacks and Hispanics? They must be because otherwise Asians could not have managed to up their numbers. Since minorities are a weak bunch of people there is no way they could have fought a force as overwhelmingly strong as 'subtle sexism' from a group as intimidating as 'the great white nerds'.<br>Please tell me you don't believe that because if you do then you are the real racist.<br>Now lets talk about women. You say the percentage of women has decreased in programming, that is the statistic but is the field of programming the same as it was back when women made up a larger percentage. Looking at that picture, programming looks like a social activity rather than an individual task as it has become now. Could that be the reason why most women don't fancy programming? Lets look at the video gaming market, the overwhelming majority of gamers are men, why are there few women there? Please don't tell me it is because the games are sexist. Women are a lot stronger than you estimate them to be, not all women are delicate cry babies. When they are driven to a field they even deal with industries that have casting couches, nerds are probably the most harmless group of people to women and they get accused of being sexist! Only reason women don't make up a larger percent is because only some of them are excited by the concept of slogging in front of a lighted screen for long hours with no social life.<br>If you would want to continue thinking that women and minorities are weak enough to be intimidated by white geeks then may long live your arrogance, kind sir!<br></p>
