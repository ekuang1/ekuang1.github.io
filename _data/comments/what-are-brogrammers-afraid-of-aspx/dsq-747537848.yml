message: <p>As a woman in IT I can offer the following observations.<br>while I have enjoyed some of my career, I have almost left the field several times.  But not because of discrimination.<br>As already mentioned it is culture and perception.  Where I have worked, it has always been expected that there would be NO work life balance.  Live by the blackberry, burn the midnight oil, make no plans for evenings or Friday nights, be ready to jump, etc.  And, if you should actually get some free time you should be reading, advancing your skills on your own time, publishing, etc. if you really want to advance.  I have seen folks rejected in interviews because they indicated they expected some respect of their personal time or because they had small children that might require their attention.  It has taken me 20 years to find a company where I feel like I can have personal boundaries without fear of reprisals.<br>When I have tried to encourage others to work in IT because it can be an awesome career, none are willing to give up their life because of how IT culture is perceived.  Colleagues with college age children say their kids want nothing to do with it because "who wants that aggravation?".<br>I feel blessed to have finally found a company that has real work life balance for IT folks.  No more cancelling family plans or working evenings and weekends without respectful consideration on my employer's side.<br>Our children are watching us and don't want our lives.  And it's sad because it is a manufactured culture, grown out of martyrdom (as someone pointed out, reward the hero, not the solid performer), not necessity.</p>
