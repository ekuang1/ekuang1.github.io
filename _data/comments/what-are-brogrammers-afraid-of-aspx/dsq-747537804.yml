message: <p>I have mixed feelings and not sure they will come out the right way. I too have young daughter and hopefully she gets opportunities I had access to. <br>Opensource contribution - This may not be the right "barometer" to take away the "contribution". As many women programmers also graduate into "project management/people management" and do better job at least in services industry - you can check the ibms, hps. I can certainly confirm Infosys, Wipro, TCS. They are also working on customer projects as programmers, but somehow this profession does not have the "glamor" associated with it. So idea is to move out of it quickly and become "manager". <br>Time requirement for being passionate about "programming" - In general the feeling is still of "women" at eod  representing the good part of the family, managing it, nurturing it. I have seen so many excellent talents, freinds keeping their passion for solving problems and becoming that yoke in that other world. Programming /learning requires time, isolation which social etiquette abhors. Most of their life they have been "trained" to please others - parents, teachers, society. They have not been nurtured to do their own thing.  <br>Diversity for sake of it - "reserved/push" at expense of others - today in name of diversity many-2 people are pushed ahead of others. Sometimes it is ok in name of justice, but being at other side of the stick all the time is not fun. This needs to be avoided and opportunities need to be same for everybody despite the background. I do not have an answer but I am hoping it will smooth out over years.  WE are part of the solution and generally people do right things , faith in good part of people works wonders.</p>
