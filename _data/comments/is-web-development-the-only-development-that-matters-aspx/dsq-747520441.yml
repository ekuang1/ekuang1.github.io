message: <p>I just got back from an insiders marketing/SEO conference .  What was immediately apparent is that the majority of tools and services they use are not Microsoft.  In fact, I can't think of one service they discussed that was.  <br>Although this isn't directly related to your post, I am finding in my own the world the pull towards non-Microsoft.</p>
