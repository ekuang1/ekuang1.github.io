message: <p>Microsoft really needs to work harder to regain the hobbyist market.  This seems to be a cycle with them, they think they own the world, then they move away from hobbyists then they go back.<br>What's that mean?<br>- Embracing open source more... start working with OSS teams to utilize there stuff, instead of rolling your own.  Or at least have a better reason for abandoning community standards other than NIH syndrome.<br>- Insuring hobbyists and ISVs have easy access to the development tools.  Good move on giving away Express, and the free Std edition from watching videos.  But they can do more here.<br>Codeplex is a good start, but I think it's clear from the various comments in issues and on project levels that TFS ought to be able to work more like SVN with the Edit/Merge/Commit pattern.</p>
