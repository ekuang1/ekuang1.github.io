message: <p>I think I got hit by the same a****** over the weekend.<br><br><br><br>I've had a .Text blog for over a year, but just a week ago I finally gave up and changed everything over to a customized version of the CommunityStarterKit.<br><br><br><br>I setup a custom 302 redirect from my old urls to my new urls, so when the robot hit - everything got pushed over to my new site, which doesn't allow anonymous comments of course (and different arguments to boot).<br><br><br><br>Anyway, their 1,274 comment spams went nowhere, but it was quite a load none the less.<br><br><br><br>The IP address I tracked was 218.80.119.240, which belongs to the same ISP block as several other comment spam attempts in the past. I built in IP blocking for my custom install, but I think I'm going to build IP ranges now.<br><br><br><br>See <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall.ch?domain=218.80.119.240" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall.ch?domain=218.80.119.240">http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall.ch?domain=218.80.119.240</a><br><br><br><br>Good luck with Subtext.</p>
