message: <p>&gt; Unless you mean integers, there are an infinite number of real numbers ’from 1 to 100’<br>This an incredibly dense statement that only Homo Logicus would ever make.<br>Are programmers really this out of touch with the real world? Must every statement be laden with qualifiers and explanations, as if we're speaking to an autistic person?</p>
