message: <p>"Are programmers really this out of touch with the real world? Must every statement be laden with qualifiers and explanations, as if we're speaking to an autistic person?"<br>Yes, because we have to deal with users all day long. Dealing with people who routinely call Excel Spreadsheets "databases" when you spend the other half of your day correcting case on variable names and telling compilers EXACTLY what you want them to do, down to differentiating  different KINDS of numbers (decimal, float, int) imposes a certain mindset. The "you-can't-trust-what-anyone-says" mindset.<br>Because here is how FizzBuzz would work in real life. The project manager would say you should loop over a list of numbers, the client would say they will provide the list of numbers, they would confirm that they are integers when you ask them, then they would send the file over containing the list of numbers. You would look at the list and see the following:<br>one<br>Two<br>three<br>three-a<br>Then they would wonder why you are drinking so much more lately. The file would be in EBCDIC format of course.</p>
