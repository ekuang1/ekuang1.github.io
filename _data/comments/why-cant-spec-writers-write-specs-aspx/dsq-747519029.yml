message: "<p>@Tap and @Ray this was my point when I said it was wrong in Phil's last post on this well-beaten topic. I thought I was being picky (so let it go) but if you read the spec a few times you realize that Phil's response was correct (as written) but so is this for line 15<br>FizzBuzzFizzBuzz<br>Since 15 meets all conditions and the spec doesn't say anything about explicit output :).<br>@SLW: are you trying to tell me you know how to write a loop with REAL numbers from 1 to 100? Given your lazy (sic) approach, how would you even increment the first step before being consumed by a black hole?</p>"
