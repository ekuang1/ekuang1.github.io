message: <p>I agree with Rob Conery's comment:<br>"in many ways (in the work place especially) a person marks their ability by the questions they ask."<br>It's also worth pointing out that a spec writer, be it a developer, business analyst, consultant, etc., is often working in ambiguous situations which to me are the most exciting ones to be in because you're being the given the opportunity to help to refine/define a need, rather than just be someone who's delegated information to that needs to capture it accurately - exciting stuff!<br>That point alone really brings home the fact that capturing needs is not just about a person's capturing skills, but it's about their listening skills and capability to participate in ambiguous environments. <br>Final note - a lot of the time meetings are organized so that people capturing notes just have to listen and capture accurately without proactively participating in conversations. Meetings themselves don't always produce specs but should produce accurate notes, and there should always be people on the capturer's side who are proactive and capable of working effectively in ambiguous environments!</p>
