message: <p>I see your point definitely, but in many ways (in the work place especially) a person marks their ability by the questions they ask. In an interview setting, if I was the interviewer and threw down FizzBuzz, and the candidate said to me "do you want integers or all real numbers?" I would be tempted to say something snarky like:<br>"Good question. I have nothing to do for the next infinite amount of time - so let's go with Real. How exactly would you create such a loop anyway?"<br>But instead would say:<br>"Thank you for your time"<br>I know the point your making here Phil (and believe me, I agree whole-heartedly that spec writing needs to improve) but I think it's all the more important to know which questions to ask. This would NOT be one of them :).</p>
