message: <p>Very good points.<br>I worked for a company who proposed and then installed a large CONTENT management system for a very large publicly funded UK organisation. Very soon after deployment it was discovered what they actually wanted was a DOCUMENT management system.<br>The point being, if a big 'professional' company can screw up like that, smaller organisations must be really careful and don't skimp on design briefs and specifications...</p>
