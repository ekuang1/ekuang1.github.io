message: <p>Why can't Project Managers Manage...Projects?  <br>The post is interesting, but I guess given some of the other stipulations it would be integer numbers.  When in the spec it says every multiple of 3 should print Fizz, every multiple of 5 should print Buzz, and every multiple of 3 and 5 should print FizzBuzz, makes me assume they are refering to integer numbers.  Making that assumption might be bad, but for something like that does it have to be spelled out like 1 + 1 = 2.  BTW sorry if I messed up the FizzBuzz multiples I am doing it from memory.</p>
