message: <p>YES<br>NO<br>OF COURSE! - The fact that this software does not utilize multiple DB's is almost criminal. Every other blog out there does. PLUS 99&amp; of the web hosts out there do NOT CHARGE for MySQL. While THEY ALL charge for MSSQL. It just makes sense. This is why all the major brands of blogs use MySQL. Much wider audience will be available. If you just want to narrow your target audience to .net developers who run their own servers...then you're doing well.</p>
