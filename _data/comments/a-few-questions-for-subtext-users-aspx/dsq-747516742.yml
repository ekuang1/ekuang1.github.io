message: <p>1) No<br>2) No<br>3) No<br>If you are looking to rid oneself of unused features, what about killing articles and instead allowing us to indicate on a blog post whether to show the whole posting on the blog page/rss feed or just use an abstract on the blog/feed and link to the whole blog post? <br>Seems to me this would totally eliminate the need for articles and still give people the freedom to go either way (abstracts or full posts).</p>
