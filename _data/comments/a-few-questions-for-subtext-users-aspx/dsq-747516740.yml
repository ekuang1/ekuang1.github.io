message: <p>1. No<br>2. No<br>3. Totally, and that's 2 versions one without Stored Procedures (MySql 4.#.# and below)and one with stored procedures support for MySql 5 and above. And I think That would be easy to move to PostgresSQL from there.<br>Then NHibernate will make Subtext more complex and that would scared some people - like me, believe me, I like the description in the homepage of subtext too! Simplicity  -  I think SubText should have their own data access methods maybe with a pluggable provider model where we can switch easily between databases. And where you can easily modified de code or help some others find problems, I donâ€™t want to learn a whole new framework like NHibernate or go deep into their class library.<br>In the other hand I will never use any new upcoming technologies from Microsoft(LINQ, ATLAS ETC, Dont get me wrong, I like MS but I like the idea of an open world) I Think <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> is already rich enough to handle what SubText need to do, I think mono support will be a really cool thing here. So less dependencies the better however It is just my opinion.<br><br></p>
