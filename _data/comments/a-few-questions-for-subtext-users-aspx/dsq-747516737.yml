message: <p>Going back to the original question at hand (late, as usual)...<br>1. No<br>2. No<br>3. Yes - I've actually had a few colleagues who were interested in subTEXT until they found out that they'd need to run atop MSSQL Server. They were what I would call our "target users"  - wanted to host on their own equipment - and they had access to Windows Server, but not SQL Server. They had hoped to be able to run against a MySQL (or other _free_) backend data store.<br>Of course, I tried to interest them in getting involved with the project and building a MySQL Provider (we do suffer from a little <a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2005/09/19/10231.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://haacked.com/archive/2005/09/19/10231.aspx">Premature Generalization</a> in that area) but I was apparently unconvincing.<br>At any rate, I would like to see us support portability so that we can attract (and hold onto) those who wish to use the other db options that are available. Plus, it will help when it comes time to support subTEXT on <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>.</p>
