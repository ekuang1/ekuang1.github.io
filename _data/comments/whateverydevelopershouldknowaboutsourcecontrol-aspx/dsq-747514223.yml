message: <p>"If my compsci courses had covered VSS, I'm pretty sure I would have ended up being a janitor."<br><br><br><br>Jayson... I couldn't agree more! <br><br><br><br>&lt;rant&gt;The "control" that VSS uses is simply unacceptable when working in large and/or distributed teams. Having to worry about a file being locked/unlocked every time a developer wants to make a change is stupid. To be honest, I don't understand what MS was thinking* when this whole concept was developed.&lt;/rant&gt;<br><br><br><br>I'm not saying that any other existing Version Control system has all of the answers, but several of them come a LOT closer than VSS. CVS [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System</a>] has been the defacto source control for some time now, and Subversion [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_%28software%29" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_%28software%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_%28software%29</a>] is quickly moving up the ranks.  (I know that at least Phil &amp; I are looking forward to SourceForge moving to it so we can use it with subText [<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/subtext" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/subtext">https://sourceforge.net/projects/subtext</a>].) I use Rational ClearCase [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ClearCase" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ClearCase">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ClearCase</a>] at work and it works very will for our large and very distributed team... tho it is not FREE and so not very suitable for OSS projects.<br><br><br><br>At any rate, I think learning version control is huge stepping stone in a devloper's life. And like most other major events, no matter how much reading you do, you'll never fully understand/appreciate it until you do try it for yourself... and then screw it up, twice!<br><br><br><br>* = I realize that VSS may suite the lone/n00b software developer just fine, but very quickly it will become more hassle than its worth.</p>
