message: <p>Yep, great article!  I passed it around the dev shop too for everyone to read.  Not sure they have or will but that's up to them.  After reading I realized how to use version control for more than just keeping a backup and history of the code.  I do some side projects in my free time with a very small company (2 devs/1 designer/1 business guy).<br><br><br><br>The 2 devs are fresh out of college and the designer has never worked professionally as a designer (only in his free time as a hobby).  None of them have a clue of version control and the one time I mentioned it they all balked as it would just be "another" step in the process.  Honestly, I don't think they understand its place in the process and they don't know it so they just assume its not needed.  Since I just contract for the stuff the other guys don't have the chops for keep my mouth shut and let it go.  But more than a few times they've lost or overwritten code completely or switched versions of code between projects, etc..  Thus, any work I do for them goes in my Vault.<br><br><br><br>I use Vault for my personal and side projects but we use StarTeam from Borland at work.  Both are good and though StarTeam isn't as well known it does have some cool features that I wish Vault had.</p>
