message: <p>Thanks for the link to Eric's article Phil. As a n00b developer I think I'll make some time in the very near future to read it through. Between myself and the other [experienced] dev on my team I think we easily 'blow' 3-5 hours every week troubleshooting source control issues. A major pita!</p>
