message: <p>@Phil &gt;&gt; "As an aside, I would expect any developer who knew how to use a stack in this way would probably have no problem with recursion. After all, what is a recursive method really doing under the hood but implicitely making use of the call stack?"<br>I think that is the key statement in the entire post!  <br></p>
