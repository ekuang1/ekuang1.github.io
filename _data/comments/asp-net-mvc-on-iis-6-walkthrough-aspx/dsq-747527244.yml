message: <p>I have followed this set of instructions closely.  However, when I view my site in browser on the server as //localhost/domainname/ there's no styling, despite the fact that default.aspx.vb already has HttpContext.Current.RewritePath(Request.ApplicationPath, False).  Is there something else I need to change?<br>Thanks!</p>
