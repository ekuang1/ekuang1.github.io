message: <p>Good to know the url problem when looking at the root request was a bug with Default.aspx.cs that is going to be fixed.  I have been using Url.Content everywhere instead which can get ugly.  For instance after the SP1 jquery patch I had two links to jquery -- one with url.content that didn't provide intellisense but would work when deployed, and another wrapped in a if(false) block just to provide intellisense.</p>
