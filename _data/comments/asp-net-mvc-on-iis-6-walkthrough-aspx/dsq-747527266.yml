message: <p>What if I have an existing MVC site that I am migrating from another server box?  Do I have to set it up as a virtual application as well?  Right now, my Lead Designer has it as a website folder (with the little blue globe icon) underneath the Websites folder in IIS.  Can I turn this into a virtual application and do the steps in your walkthrough?  Thanks.</p>
