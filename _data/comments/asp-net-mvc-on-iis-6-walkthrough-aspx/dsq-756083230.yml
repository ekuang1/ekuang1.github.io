message: <p> Nearly all the fixes for MVC on IIS 6 tell me to right-click on the website node and then click on Properties below that.  There we're supposed to get to a nice Windows dialog box with a bunch of tabs including "Home Directory", which may be called "Virtual Directory" instead.  But it doesn't happen.  I do see a variety of attributes listed in the main, central display area, but there's nothing there which, to my mind, maps to "Home" or "Default" directory.  </p><p>The website in question was built as a Web Application and published using the command under the Build Menu in Visual Studio.  I've also tried doing it with a web deployment package, but either way the website will not run under IIS.  I can't help but wonder why this would be so difficult, when the *code* in Global.asax is supposed to handle the parsing and routing of URLS.</p><p>There must be something simple that I'm overlooking.  Is there any general diagnostic for IIS 6.0 that can tell me what's missing?  For example, how can I tell what level of MVC it can handle?</p>
