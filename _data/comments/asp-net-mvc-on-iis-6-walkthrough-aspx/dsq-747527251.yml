message: <p>In MVC 2 RC2 I found the following changes needed to be made relative to this article if you go with the wildcard strategy.<br>* Remove the .mvc Extension handler<br>* Remove the .mvc from your Default Route ({controller}.mvc)<br>The web.config in the new version already registers for the .mvc it seems and does the right thing.</p>
