message: <p>Everything works perfectly!!! I have tried my MVC site on both IIS6 and IIS7 with my current host (<a href="http://www.asphostcentral.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.asphostcentral.com">http://www.asphostcentral.com</a>) and they are all working fine. I am really grateful with this well-written article and I certainly hope it will help the other community members in getting up their first MVC site.<br>Believe me, this technology is just amazing!!</p>
