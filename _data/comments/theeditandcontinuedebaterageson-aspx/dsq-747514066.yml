message: <p>Hmmmm, I'd rather MS spent more time making sure the IDE doesn't leak memory like a 2-year old with a runny nose before working on any new features. ;)<br><br><br><br>Heck, I'd be satisfied if they just included some kind of backwards compatibility with 2K3 web projects. Maybe an emulation mode. I know the ASP.NET team is releasing a web projects add-on, but I don't think that's intended to address the migration issues.</p>
