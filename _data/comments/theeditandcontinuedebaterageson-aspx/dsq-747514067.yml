message: <p>E&amp;C is a vb feature because the VB team coded it.  They would no more fix bugs in the IDE than they would resolve issues in MS Office.  While I would rather have seen them spend time on VB refactoring, I am kinda glad they didn't since now I use CodeRush/Refactor which is way more powerful than most of Microsofts attempts at IDE enhancements.<br><br><br><br>People who don't understand the need for E&amp;C seem to forget the big stink a lot of well known VB'ers made when VB.Net was released.  Microsoft is still trying to make the migration from VB6 to VB.Net easier since there are still many apps and developers stuck in that world.  If all you know is E&amp;C and VB6, then it is an important feature and shouldn't be discounted just because many people who made the jump a long time ago no longer need the feature.</p>
