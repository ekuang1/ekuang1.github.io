message: <p>These are good points, an your right I don't have evidence, merely personal experience, a heuristic, my speculation.  <br>The issue I have is that a good cconscientious employer, like those who would be reading this post, will try to do the most effective thing for business and employees.  But many or most, could (and so far in my experience do) use this research to validate pay freeze, sighting a very fuzzy market rate.<br>One last issue I want to mention,  is how am I to counter the statement that I make the market rate? I have to go out interview get an offer then come back and say "see? This is the market rate" . This of course is disingenuous to the other company.  I feel that fair market price is whatever my employer feels they "can" pay me.</p>
