message: <p>I agree that working somewhere for ten years with annual raises based on performance would most likely yield you less than if you moved around, and you were able to get more of a "fair market" offer at each place. I know that was true for me, and I was shocked when I almost went somewhere else and saw what the offer was for me to stay. That being said moving around too much makes you less attractive to employers as well, since you don't look like a long-term investment.</p><p>In this model what happens when you have another bubble burst in the software industry? Right now the app stores are saturated with multitudinous apps, and five clones of each, for everything along with tons of social media companies being valued at billions of dollars while generating no profit. What happens when the layoffs occur and the market dictates lower salaries as the supply increases while the demand does not? How do I hedge my losses to my salary? I guess in that situation you'd be as screwed as the guy getting his annual performance based raises if you were out a job and seeking a new one. But if everyone did move to this model, is it possible that salary adjustments go in the opposite direction as supply increases or demand decreases?</p><p>One thing you did mention at the beginning is that the current model discourages collaboration with others and cooperative work environments. I think that is true if you have the old Microsoft model where you are ranked relative to your teammates and your salary adjustments are based off of that; however, if your performance is simply evaluated with respect to you I don't see why it would discourage collaboration. I enjoy collaborating with my co-workers, and we enjoy sharing tips and tricks that we learn along the way. In the end, I'm not really competing against them.</p>
