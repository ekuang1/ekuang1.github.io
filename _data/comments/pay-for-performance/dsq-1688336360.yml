message: <p>This approach institutionalizes mediocrity, the same thing all the traditional time-based pay systems encourage. People don't work for money, they work for meaning, and if everyone I work with gets the same pay I do, it communicates my great work has no more meaning than their lousy work. So why work any harder than the guy beside me? I'll just cruise.</p><p>For someone who is "better than the market", they should be paid a lot more than someone who is average. Not because they are motivated by money, but because they are motivated by knowing that they're being recognized for being great. When a business owner outperforms another business owner, they make more money. Everyone should be treated like a business owner.</p><p>The other thing this article doesn't recognize is that money is only one source of results-based incentive you can give. Time is the new money and many people are more motivated by having control of their time back than even making more money.</p><p>Finally, you're missing the correlation between performance reviews and performance pay. The performance review is one of the worst leftovers of the Industrial Age Factory System and are never correlated to performance.  They should be done away with entirely and replaced with specific metrics for quality, quantity, teamwork, and other metrics that make the company successful. Then pay for performance is truly that, not some manager making subjective decisions about their favorite employee.</p><p>The biggest refutation of this is that so many companies are using it so successfully. Ivory tower studies don't hold up to real world stories. Here's just one of thousands of examples. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/198112" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/198112">http://www.entrepreneur.com...</a></p><p>In the coming two decades, results-based pay will almost completely replace time-based pay. Those companies that embrace this move to "the Participation Age" will thrive. Those that don't will be left behind.
