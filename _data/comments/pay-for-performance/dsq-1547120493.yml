message: <p>I actually strongly disagree with this model.</p><p>I could be wrong, but here's why:</p><p>You're right, compensation is not a good motivator and Daniel Pink is totally right.  However, in my opinion, the critical mistake is putting compensation and motivation into the same conversation, and THAT's actually the flaw in most models. Again, I could be totally wrong, but the way I see it, paying for performance isn't a motivation tactic, it's recognition for adding value to the company and it's positive reinforcement for making impactful contributions.  It's when you think you're motivating your team with compensation that you start getting into trouble.  (we don't have to talk about what motivates people, we both agree on that 100%).</p><p>All that said, performance-based compensation (either cash or equity) is still a very important dynamic for other reasons.  It's showing that the company is paying attention and values a team member for everything that they do in a tangible way.  It's also a tangible consequence to how a certain member of the team responds to expectations that are set and feedback that is given throughout the year (if for example, there's year-end performance-based comp.).  Without a tangible way to say something like, "hey, you really killed it and went above and beyond what we expected - you embodied X, Y, Z company values and you made the team around you better.  We really value you and want you to keep doing what you're doing.. etc.", or "Hey, we talked about A, B and C and you really didn't deliver on B and C... ", how do you expect someone to take anything you're trying to encourage seriously?  Yes, there are other ways to offer recognition, and there are other ways to get people back on the right track..  performance-based comp cannot be the only recognition given - I do not think that would work.  I do think it's pretty important piece though.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
