message: <p>Alright I do agree with all this and as I said on the twit I was skeptical about it when I first started reading, but later on I got convinced. But here is some food for thought.<br>This system works because the other system is not gone, and here is why. The premise is that you are going to use market (local) as the basis for the raise, and that will benefit both the company (retention, will to improve without compensation) and the employee (good moneys, etc.). But after a little while, once every company switches to this model, wages are going to level up, and become stable since no one is going to need to move, and no one is being awarded. Review after review the wage is going to be the same, and then what happens, how a person that is doing quite well would progress, do we just go back to the old model, or allow them to go work in other places as a way to get more money, do we give them vacations, what happens?</p>
