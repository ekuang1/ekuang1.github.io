message: <p>Agreed on the last point. Performance reviews should be based on how close each employee came to achieving his or her full potential, not comparison to peers. That's like flunking a kid in physical education class because he wasn't in the top 10% of times for running the mile among his classmates, even if he showed a lot of effort and improvement over the year and set a personal best time.</p>
