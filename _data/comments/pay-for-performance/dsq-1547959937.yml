Look at how much your employees are paid relative to the market. If they're under market, use the bonus pool to give them a bump in salary.</p><p>Maybe try and disassociate the end-of-year bonus with last year's immediate result and make it tied more towards long term growth. One way to do that might be to tie the bonus amount according to "level" rather than individual performance. That means to get a bigger bonus, you need to get promoted.</p><p>If you insist on giving performance based bonuses, at the very least, do it at the team level.
