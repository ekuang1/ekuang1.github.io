message: <p>Again, no evidence. I pointed to a study that shows that after 10 years, you make 50% of what you would if you moved around every two years. That's definitely _not_ a result that favors the interests of "big business".</p><p>That's evidence that the current predominant model of pay for performance doesn't work. The reason you make more by moving every two years is because a company that you don't yet work for _must_ pay something commensurate with the market in order to attract people.</p><p>The problem is, they don't then re-balance their existing employees who've been loyal when they do this. That's the point of this article. The pay of the employees should never fall out of lockstep with the market.</p><p>Who cares if you make more than some "other bloke" because you do great work and the bloke doesn't if you're way under market?</p>
