message: <p>I couldn't agree more.  <br>I worked in the I.T. department of a financial institution for several years, and we had twice weekly performance reviews. Your score from the review was directly related to your annual bonus.<br>To be honest I found the entire premise slightly insulting. I work hard, and I do the best work I can. So if you give me an average rating it obviously means you think I can do better. If I could do better I'd already be doing it. "What's that you're dangling over my head, a banana? Monkey jump for banana!". <br>For years I consistently scored above average for my role (thank you for the bonus, it doesn't affect how hard I work, as I always try to do my best), until they created a new role, just for me, to recognise the good work I was doing. <br>Wow, big feather in my cap eh? (NB there was no associated pay rise for this role, it was just a title "Junior Technical Architect")  <br>Thereafter I scored average on performance reviews - earning a far lower bonus - because I was doing what was expected of a Junior Technical Architect, I'd need to excel to get the larger bonus. Really dude? Why F@&amp;k you very much too!<br>I was honestly surprised by how demoralizing that was, and I was gone from that company within a year.</p>
