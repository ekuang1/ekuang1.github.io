message: <p>It’s true; we are motivated and work for intrinsic reasons.<br>We survive from extrinsic reasons. This is why money doesn’t make you work<br>faster though cost of living requires money and it’s directly tied to sustaining<br>your quality of life. Additionally, intrinsic motivators are based on extrinsic<br>motivators. You will perform better when you genuinely like and trust your<br>coworkers and leadership team. That trust is generally given to you as extrinsic<br>act of kindness. This being many factors of money, benefits, good will, kind<br>words, people looking out for you, etc…</p><p>I think annual (maintain cost of living) raises to adjust market<br>changes should never go away. The “adjustable wages” based on market rate of a<br>profession is a nice concept to think about though companies will not willingly<br>increase wages of current employees without a vice. I mean like head clamped in<br>while kicking and screaming. Remember, we live in a capitalistic society where<br>the big boys want to keep getting richer. Pay per performance is not an IT<br>thing. It’s a culture thing starting with the financial markets. Companies that<br>don’t perform well get punished in the financial system. The concept of the<br>bonus system is if the company does well, they will share a little of the<br>wealth with employees. This in turn increases the employee’s intrinsic likability<br>factor for the company. This is like when you get a great deal on a car, you<br>take the kids out to a nice place for dinner. The problems arise from the greed<br>of leaders who loose site of why they are giving the bonus. It’s like telling<br>your kids you got a bonus at work and you are taking them out later that month,<br>though you tell them they have to keep their rooms clean, get A’s on all homework,<br>and not be disrespectful or they won’t. This would take the wind out of the<br>sail of the original act of kindness. It really comes down to be kind and just with<br>people and they will be kind and just with you.</p>
