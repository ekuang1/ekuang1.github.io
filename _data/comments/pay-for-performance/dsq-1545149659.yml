message: "<p>About the Netflix model, doesn't it just all boil down to point 3:</p><p>\"What would we pay to keep that person (if they had a bigger offer elsewhere)?\"</p><p>The other's are irrelevant in most cases as they depend on circumstances. Not all companies are rolling in cash and not all employees can get market rate salaries. The only question for the company is: How much can we afford?  Companies should always assume any given employer has a better offer elsewhere and then determine how much more they could pay that employee without over stretching themselves. And THAT figure is what the given employee's salary should actually be now. It should not be an offer that is made when they resign. This way if they do resign, as a company you can feel happy that you have done all you can to keep them and bid them good luck and farewell.</p><p>Note: all of this assumes that you are being \"nice\" to your employees. I believe many employees resign over matters not related to pay.</p>"
