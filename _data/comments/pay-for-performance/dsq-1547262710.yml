message: <p>I haven't read Pinks research, but let me offer an analogy,  There are countless shops out there that are "agile".  Perhaps 1 in 10 of them know there ass from a hole in the wall.  If we were to do research on agile shops, I imagine we would find some pretty strange things.  We might find that agile just meant not taking responsibility for your work or your dead lines or business interests.  <br>I don't mean to impune anyone's character, but ones research may lead to conclusions that are exactly in the interest of big business and not in the interest of the prolet... the worker.  <br>seriously though, this is sociology, not mathematics, and as such there is a wide range of results that can be expected.<br>I can tell you first hand that business cares very much about money.  The entire system is predicated on more money equals good, less money equals bad.  The business isn't going to come down and speak to me on my level about the cool things I'm doing, how I'm reducing error rates and making the code more extensible.  The business can only speak to me in the language it knows.  And when I do great work but I make as much (supposedly) as some other bloke so I don't get a raise or a bonus, that tells me that the business doesn't value me.  <br>as an aside, agile that is practices correctly is the exact opposite of what I said above.  The point is that bad implementation ( which seems to be the rule with agile ) leads to bad results.  That should not color the assessment of the idea.</p>
