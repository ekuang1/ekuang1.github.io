message: <p>Great article.</p><p>I would like to know you opinion on incentive remuneration e.g.<br>end of year bonus. At the moment we are using performance reviews to give<br>us an indication of a personâ€™s performance relative to their current role and<br>their peers. Using this we then apportion the bonus pool to the individual<br>employees.</p><p>We do find the same issues you highlighted. People are chasing high scores for the<br>sake of the score rather than advancing themselves and their careers. Ideally<br>we want to pay people an incentive bonus but are clueless on a good method to<br>distribute the wealth.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
