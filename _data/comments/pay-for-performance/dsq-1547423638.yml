message: <p>I'm not trying to contradict that :)</p><p>In the absence of true intrinsic motivators, yes, performance-based compensation can have a demotivating effect in some circumstances.  My point was that if you try to use compensation as your primary motivator (or any kind of motivator, for that matter), then you've already failed.</p><p>Recognition != Motivation.  Nor should recognition (read, performance-based comp.) be given with an expectation of reciprocity via increased motivation.</p>
