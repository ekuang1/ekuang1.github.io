message: <p>The main flaw in this plan is that often either employees nor employer have a clear idea of market rate. Further, when I take a new job generally they ask what I'm currently making and then what I would like to be making. From there the negotiations begin.  The idea of market value only comes up implicitly when you ask for more then they can give you.<br>Lastly, my current company implemented this plan with no official anouncement. At review time I was just told that there would be no more raises except for those who were currently below market.  Those twats.   Made me want to start looking right away. I knew that I was doing a great job and I felt some form of acknowledgment was do. Instead I was told to get used to my salary. Furthermore, i feel pretty sure i could make more elsewhere very easily.  It just happens that I really enjoy what I'm building right now. So ill stay till something even more interesting comes along and then I'll leave with resentment. . Clearly a bad implementation. <br></p>
