message: <p>&gt; My point was that if you try to use compensation as your primary motivator (or any kind of motivator, for that matter), then you've already failed.</p><p>Oh, I absolutely agree with that!</p><p>I was confused because you said you disagree with this model. This model is about correcting a demotivating force. It's not about how to motivate. It's about how to pay people fairly over time.</p><p> I plan on writing up my thoughts on better approaches to motivation in the future. :)</p>
