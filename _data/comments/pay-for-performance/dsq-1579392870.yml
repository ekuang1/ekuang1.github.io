message: <p>Your feelings on the matter is an anecdote, not evidence. Clearly you've missed the whole point of my post if you call it "communist". What could be more capitalist than letting the market dictate your pay as opposed to how hard you work regardless of the market value of that work?</p><p>Also, under such a plan, your performance is rewarded, but over a longer period of time as you increase your personal market value. But even that has to be tied with gaining skills and abilities that are valuable in the market. If you're a great mail sorter, I don't care how good you perform, there will be a ceiling on what you can expect to be paid.</p><p>And if his research is flawed, it shouldn't be hard to find solid research that counters it.</p>
