message: <p>Hi Justin</p><p>We have the profit share in place. The challenge is what method is used to allocate the share to the various employees. At the moment we are using performance scores to rank people and then allocate the bonus based on a multiple of their cost to company.</p><p>The issue with this is that people chase a high rating during reviews (which happen quarterly) rather than just focusing on improving themselves in terms of their careers.</p><p>Ideally we would like to decouple this as per the original article. We also want to reward people who are stars with more of the profits vs. the average employee.</p>
