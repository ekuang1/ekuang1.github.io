message: <p>That's an awesome post. And how hilariously true! I DID have to stop for a moment to see if you were talking about me with the RSS part. I just signed up with bloglines and went about adding feeds. I added my own website to see what it looked like from the bloglines site. Not really for vanity, but I had to second guess myself when I read that paragraph! I screamed:"Good God, am I vain blogger?!"<br><br><br><br>(Website address not given so as not to fulfill James comment...) :)<br><br><br><br></p>
