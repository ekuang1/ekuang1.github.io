message: "Re: \"Penalizing loyalty\" I suspect that information asymmetry is not the only (or even dominant) component: risk/change aversion likely plays a strong roll. The marginal value of pay can be negligible compared to those other considerations. E.g. \"You would have to more than double my pay before it would meaningfully change how I live my life.\"\r\n\r\nWhat all this has me thinking is that there should be a market for the middle ground: There are people (example me) where \"work from home\" really isn't a great option (I am more productive when I have the work/home distinction to drive my attention and when I have friction-free access to \"insiders\"). And even for people who's personality allows work-from-home, there are times where putting people in the same room is just better. So I suspect that even going forward, companies will have a legitimate interest in having local \"office space\" for workers. That would suggest that companies will be insensitivity to higher people (i.e. will be willing to offer more pay) in places where they already have offices ... or /where they can cheaply get them/. Which suggests there may be a market in outsources setting up small offices. If Google/etc. could contract out standing up an 8 person office in Winnemucca, up and running in 2-3 weeks, for less cash per seat than it costs to get +=8 seats in Mt View, they could afford to spend some of that on salary.  \r\n"
