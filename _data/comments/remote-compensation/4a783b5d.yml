  There will always be a degree of dynamic tension there so long as there's a benefit to living in / near a tech hub. For instance, the company I work for is based in San Francisco but also has an office in Raleigh, NC (which is itself something of a tech hub, though a fraction the size of the Bay Area). Although I'm sure SF developers get paid significantly more than NC developers, I don't think the differential scales linearly with cost of living. And yet, we haven't seen a mass exodus of workers from SF moving to Raleigh (indeed, nobody has done so). You'd think the argument that you can buy a house in NC and still have more disposable income per month then you have renting an apartment in SF would induce at least SOMEONE to pull the trigger!





  But it turns out there are myriad arguments against that. Some just like living in a bigger city. Some like the better public transportation (odd as it is to refer to the BART as "better" transportation, Raleigh's transportation infrastructure is abysmal). Many feel like the chances of landing a good next job are higher if they're in a tech hub -- not just because of geographic proximity (which becomes less of an issue with remote work) but because of networking. There are opportunities to spend time with a quantity of like-minded people which just aren't there in Columbus, OH or even Raleigh, NC.





  Time will tell whether this dynamic tension shifts as more positions become permanently remote, but so far I haven't seen much of a shift.
