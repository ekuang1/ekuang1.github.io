message: "All good points. \r\n\r\nI agree fully with one of your earliest arguments: \"Yes, local market rates determine compensation today, but as remote work grows, local market rates for remote worker talent is not sustainable.\" \r\n\r\nLater, you make another valid point, citing the \"Law of One Price\":  \"The general trend would be for developer salaries across the country to reach something approaching equilibrium. This follows the law of one price.\"\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, I think you are *not necessarily* agreeing with David Anson's assertion that compensation shouldn't be tied to the locally prevailing rates. Rather, if I am correct, you are saying that companies will try to do that, but in the long run, companies won't be able to sustain that practice. (Do I understand you correctly?)\r\n\r\nThe equilibrium that you speak of is the key point. As more and more developers for Silicon Valley companies work remotely, their talents will start to compete with the talents of developers also working remotely. So, over time, their total compensation will tend to fall, while the total compensation of remote workers living in, for example, Columbus, OH, will tend to rise. The equilibrium that you speak of will tend to settle somewhere in between the high rates of Silicon Valley and the lower rates of other places, like cities in the Midwest. "
