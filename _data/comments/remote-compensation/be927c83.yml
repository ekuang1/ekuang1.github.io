message: "@Billy Ray - I agree, \"Study\" isn't the right word. It was more of a calculation based on average salary growth vs average raise. The average raise in 2014 was 3%. In 2020 it's projected to be 3.3%.However, among data scientists (to use one easy to find dataset), switching jobs netted an <a href=\"https://www.burtchworks.com/2019/05/13/2019-update-analytics-salary-increases-when-changing-jobs/\">average increase of 10 to 20% in 2019</a>. So it seems the original analysis still stands. I suppose it depends on the industry and what the average increase is for switching jobs."
