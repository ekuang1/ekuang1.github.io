message: I generally agree with all this, but the one exception I would make is local taxes.  If I live in a high tax state, some portion of my income is going to those taxes.  If I move to a low tax state (total taxes, factoring income, sales tax, etc) and keep my same salary, then I effectively get a raise.  I think a minor adjustment for different tax situations would be fine but overall people doing the same work should be paid the same.
