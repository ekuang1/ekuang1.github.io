message: "This is really interesting. Being overseas and working remotely with US companies, I've been following closely how they tend to hire and pay for overseas workers. \r\n\r\nI can confirm that it's a mixed result, but only because many of those companies tend to try to find agencies that hire on their behalf, which then take a cut. So what happens is that the quality of those developers, that end up being pay less than half of a US contractor, is not good. And those agencies cannot guarantee those people are good enough.\r\n\r\nWhen the salary is close enough to US salary, that when you find people that are in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Europe, etc, that are as good if not better than people you can find for that amount in the US. These companies don't want to go cheap, but rather to find talent they can't find in the US because they have to compete with Uber, Apple, FB, Google and many other companies paying more than 120, 140, 160k. So they get someone for say 80, 100, 120k, which save them money and fills the vacancy they've been having for months. And this is also an amazing deal to those developers because they are able to make much more than they make locally due to them having their salary in dollars. "
