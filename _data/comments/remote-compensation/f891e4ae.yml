  @Norm great observation! Personally, I do agree with David because I think it's fair. But you are correct that my post isn't necessarily agreeing nor disagreeing with Anson's assertion. Really, my post is making the claim that it doesn't <em>matter</em> whether I agree or not because in the long run the law of one price takes over.

  I would assume so. But it's an interesting question. A lot of companies claim there are simply not enough developers to go around. So the question is, if these companies hired remote, would supply suddenly meet demand? Or will demand still outstrip supply. In the latter case, developer wages would remain high across the company. So the equilibrium would settle closer to the rates of SF than cities in the Midwest. This is a question I don't have enough information on to make an educated guess of where it would land.
