  I feel your assumptions are incorrect (but I'll continue reading after this comment). As long as there are companies who use minimum wage as their starting point, there will be companies who will pay based on location. Why pay a developer in SF 220K when you can hire one remote in Memphis and pay 130k. IIRC Memphis median income is around 65k. Companies will do whatever they can to save money and continue to pay the C-suites 8 figure salaries even when the company is performing poorly. In a near perfect world it would be what your assumption is but in today's world I don't see it happening.
