  @BCS For sure it does, but it's still a financial "penalty" for staying. For example, the Netflix model <a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2014/08/14/pay-for-performance/">I mentioned before</a> is really interesting because they look at the market every year to adjust salaries.

  @Cleve in general though, takes affect profit but not prices (and correspondingly wages). For example, imagine you go online to buy a bobblehead doll because you're really into them. And you see a bunch of different companies selling them for $10 a piece. One company sells it for $15 a piece because the employees of that company live in a state with a high income tax. Are <em>you</em> going to buy the $15 one? Probably not.



  Likewise, a company that can hire remote employees in any state is not going to pay <em>above</em> market rates just because an employee lives in a state with a high income tax. They'll pay the market rate or hire elsewhere. Just the same way you do when considering prices of goods.
