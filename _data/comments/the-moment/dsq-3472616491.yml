message: "<p>A great piece, a masterpiece, this is.</p><p>These thought patterns mimic mine at some points: \"Is this really a turning point in my life? Wow, I do think I'll be able to point this moment out as the defining moment of my life.\" I think I've sort of started to live like a movie at some point, where only the important moments are worthy of attention. Thus I think that if my awareness is heightened, it is only so in the most important moments, while everything else - eating, sleeping, wasting time - is just filler content to wade through. Life becomes richer as I abandon all that, and accept every moment as equal, and every notion of imminent grandeur as foolish thought.</p><p>Thanks for the nudge to think these thoughts.</p>"
