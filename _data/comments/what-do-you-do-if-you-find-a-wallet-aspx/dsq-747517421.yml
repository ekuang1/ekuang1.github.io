message: <p>Makes me feel better about myself. My wife blew a speaker in her car - the kind that can only be purchased at the dealer (each speaker has it's own amp built into it).<br>When I went to pay, they totally forgot to charge me the $167 dollars for the speaker. I let them know.<br>So, at least some people are semi-honest in these days. Of course, $103 worth of NyQuil and KY *is* kind of tempting.</p>
