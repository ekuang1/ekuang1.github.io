message: <p>The <code>AuthorizeAttribute</code> is not the thing that causes the forms login redirect. It's the FormsAuthenticationModule. The authorize attribute just sets a status of being unauthorized.<br>You could replace the FormsAuthenticationModule with a custome one. Or perhaps even easire, just use the same login page, but have it change its behavior depending on the status of the current user.</p>
