message: '<p>Sorry man, too difficult to digest the code you have shown for the conditional filters, probably the framework should include a nice wrapper for filter registration. Comparing to rails though I am not an expert:<br>before_filter: do_this, :only =&gt; :index<br>or<br>before_filter: do_that, :except=&gt; :show</p>'
