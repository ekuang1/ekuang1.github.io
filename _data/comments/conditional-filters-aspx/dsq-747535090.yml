message: <p>I like this approach Phil, thanks for the heads up. Previously I have just added the filter onto the base controller and added a property that "disabled" it for that request. So all my actions do not need to explicitly be marked as [Authorize] however on my login action I just need to decorate it with [Authorize(ByPass=true)]</p>
