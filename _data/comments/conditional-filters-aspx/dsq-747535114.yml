message: '<p>Phil,<br>Thank you for the great article. I have a similar situation and I am trying to avoid overkill.<br>To sum it up... I have 2 types of users: "Visitors" and "Users". Users have a persistent account. Visitors do not; instead they have the option to login via an OpenID provider or legacy-style with an email address and friendly name. <br>I am trying to find a very simple way to accomodate multiple logon URLs. Right now, web.config designates the log on url, and thus all failures with [Authorize] attributes redirect there.<br><u>Blog Controller:</u><br>* Mostly anonymous access<br>* Comment actions require "visitor" authentication<br><strong>* [Authorize] failures should redirect to Account/Logon</strong><br><u>BlogAdmin Controller:</u><br>* All actions require full "user" authentication<br><strong>* [Authorize] failures should redurect to Account/Admin</strong><br>Any suggestions on how to do this as simple as possible? My first thought was extending the AuthorizeAttribute class, but thought you might know a better way.<br>Thanks.<br>-T<br><br></p>'
