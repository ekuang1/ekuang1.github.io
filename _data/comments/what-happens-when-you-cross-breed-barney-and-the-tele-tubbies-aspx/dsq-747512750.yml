message: <p>Dude, tell me about it. <br><br><br><br>My 1 year old just completed a phase where she required this show for her daily existance. The rest of us were cautiously optimistic that our new alien friends would bring a new age of shiny rainbow happy times to our planet. When this failed to materialize, we quickly soured on the BoohBah alien cabal, Mr. Man, Mrs. Lady, Grand Papa, Grand Mamma, and Brother and Sister. Our hopes are not pinned on the brother and sister duo, Charlie and Lola. At least they have a peppy theme song:<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.throwingbeans.org/audio/charlie-and-lola-theme.mp3" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.throwingbeans.org/audio/charlie-and-lola-theme.mp3">http://www.throwingbeans.org/audio/charlie-and-lola-theme.mp3</a></p>
