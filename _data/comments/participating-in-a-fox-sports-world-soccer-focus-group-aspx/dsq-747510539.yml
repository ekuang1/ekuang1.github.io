message: <p>Who are your commentators?  One is worse than the other.  My assumption is that they are Brits trying to talk like Americans who sound like Canadians. <br><br><br><br>Or are they Canadians, and therefore just bland because Canadians are just bland people. <br><br><br><br>The Euro coverage is fine, but your commentators do not speak American English, but rather sound like Brits using very un-hip phrases that mean nothing to a US audience.  Even the Euros who watch your show, could not recognize such puerile attempts at cute banter. <br><br><br><br>If you want your network to have any traction for a US audience, hire some American reporters, and focus a meaningful portion of your telecasts on the US players in Europe, US youth soccer, and the US National team.  Your nominal coverage of the US National team's next two World Cup qualifying matches was a pitiful effort.<br><br><br><br><br><br>One more thing, using the plural verb for singular nouns such as the "US side were" as opposed to the "US side was" , besides bad grammar from a US standpoint, just gives your show away as being conducted by a group of English wannabes.</p>
