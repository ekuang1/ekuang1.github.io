message: <p>I am looking forward to the new Fox Soccer Channel. I used to watch Fox Sports World alot, but it has dropped off after they stoped showing replays on Monday nights of the Scottish Primier League.<br><br><br><br>I will have to check up on them now and see thier schedules.<br><br><br><br>What did some logos look like? I am guessing FOX with a soccer ball for the "O"?<br><br><br><br>Mike</p>
