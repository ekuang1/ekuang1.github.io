message: <p>Nice point :-)<br>But I think IP doesn't have an important role in Akismet.  Probably they need to block 1-2% of spams that come from amateur spammers :-D<br>It's my personal experience with them.  Akismet blocked almost 99.5% of my spams and I'm sure the component that is used to write my Akismet Add-in hasn't attended to this point.</p>
