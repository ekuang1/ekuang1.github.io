message: "<p>@born2code: I love Linq2Sql and I've had a huge amount of success with L2S + stored procs, so i'm not sure why you're not having much luck with that. Also, the linq SKIP and TAKE does make use of the TOP query and i think a where clause with count, i think. it's been ages since i looked at the sql it generates. it does NOT pull back all the records and THEN page those results. It only pulls back the 'page' required.<br>@Phil: another great article! I have a quick question about this post. DISCLAIMER: I've not downloaded the project source, so i've not looked at the full code. The action method you've written is GREAT for some AJAX magic. What about when you first hit the resource (eg. /home/index) .... how do u populate the grid then? You do not? you have an empty grid and then make another call, via ajax, to populate it? I'm a huge fan of ajax but would you consider populating the grid when the resource first gets hit, reducing one more call. I know it sounds like like this is another case for premature optimization (anti-pattern), but I generally like to render the view fully if possible and use ajax for user interaction. I would love your thoughts on this.<br>-PK-</p>"
