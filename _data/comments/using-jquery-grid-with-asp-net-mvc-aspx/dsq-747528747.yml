message: <p>I think that you've got a good point -- it's probably too late. Not to be pessimistic, but with the NoSQL movement gaining attention, if not traction, it seems like the major SQL RDBMSes are more concerned with competition/proving their relevancy than with standards compliance (among other things). It's a shame, really.</p>
