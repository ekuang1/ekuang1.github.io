message: '<p>@PK &amp;&amp; @Tawani: Thanks for the feedback about Linq2SQL optimization. I was hoping it does this. I use MySQL and not MS SQL much these days (i use what ever my clients require and recently it is all MySQL). There is no good support from the MySQL native ADO.NET Connector for the Entity Framework. nHibernate and others do not support Stored procedures. <br>I tried other frameworks/driver combinations and ran into various issues with each. I am developing production applications so I cannot have an "almost working" solution, or something that would behave unexpectedly, on occasion, during real life  usage.<br>I had one of those with the anti forgery tokens when deployed to a shared host and all of the sudden started getting ViewState encryption errors because the anti forgery token code used (at the time) a shared cookie. <br>Couple more occurences like this and the client loses confidence in MVC (and my work)  :)<br>@Joe Reynolds: it is very easy to roll out your own "repeater" control with jQuery and MVC. You use jQuery like Phil did to retrieve the rows of a specific page (you can pass the page number to the MVC method) and then write a User Control that binds to the data. You can either bind the JSON results from your method, or you can use ActionResults to return a partial view and replace the content of a div. pretty cool, and i do it all the time.<br></p>'
