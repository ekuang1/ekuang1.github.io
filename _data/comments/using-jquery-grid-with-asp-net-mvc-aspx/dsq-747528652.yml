message: <p>First of all I must say it's a great blog that most certainly is great help to a lot of people out there.<br>The question I have is how can you make this unobtrusive? I know that almost everyone has javascript enabled today, but is there an easy way to help those that hasnâ€™t? I guess that the solution is to make the check on the server and provide a different view if javascript is not enabled, or can it be made easier?<br></p>
