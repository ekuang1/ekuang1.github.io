message: <p>When using your example with JSON/POST I got no data back due to a bug in the jquery validate plugin.  It seems quite serious.  My hotfix and further detail, awaiting maintainer code review, is available here:<br><a href="https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/45" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/45">github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/45</a></p>
