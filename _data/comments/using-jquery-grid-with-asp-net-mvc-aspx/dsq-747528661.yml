message: <p>Guys (those how have problem with "jqGrid is not a function" error message), you need to go to jquery.jqGrid.js file and update the line:<br>&gt;&gt;    var pathtojsfiles = "js/"; // need to be ajusted<br>Update it to whatever your path to js files is.  For me, this action fixed the problem.<br></p>
