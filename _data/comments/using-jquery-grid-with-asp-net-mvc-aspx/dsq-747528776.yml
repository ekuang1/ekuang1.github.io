message: '<p>I get to know jqGrid from the article. So thank you very much for it! Since the time I know jqGrid much more and answer many jqGrid on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/jqgrid/topusers" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/jqgrid/topusers">http://stackoverflow.com/tags/jqgrid/topusers</a>). I seen again and again that there are the same error in the posted code examples. I find out that the errors originate from your code here. If one search from "jqgrid AND mvc" one find the article on the second place after <a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog/?p=639" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.trirand.com/blog/?p=639">http://www.trirand.com/blog/?p=639</a> having no code examples, so many people use the code from the page as the template and duplicate the error.<br>So please replace in the code "i = question.Id" to "id = question.Id" (two places). In JSON data the id must be as "id" and not "i". In the current code the "i" will be ignored and jqGrid use 1,2,3... as the id values which is dangerous.<br>If would be also nice if you include the comment after "Json(jsonData);" with the text like "// in ASP.NET MVC &gt;=2.0: Json(jsonData, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet);". It would be save many time of the MVC beginners.<br>It is two the most common problems. One could make many improvements in the code, but there not so important.<br>Thanks in advance,<br>Oleg Kiriljuk</p>'
