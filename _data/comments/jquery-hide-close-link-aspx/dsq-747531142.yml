message: <p>There is an HTML 5 element to do that sort of thing (<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-details-element" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-details-element">DETAILS</a>), but none of the browsers support it the last time I checked so its specification isn't that useful. It's similar to the header content control in Silverlight.<br>The rel attribute has some well-defined, well-observed semantics in HTML, e.g., used to distinguish LINK elements for CSS and RSS/ATOM content, and, as you noted, search engines heed it as well.<br>The Visual Studio Web developer tools paid attention to nofollow, which made it handy for using externally hosted stylesheets in a page without interfering with the design surface.<br><code><br>&amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet nofollow" type="text/css" href="<a href='http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.0r4/build/reset/reset-min.css"' rel="nofollow noopener" title='http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.0r4/build/reset/reset-min.css"'>yui.yahooapis.com/.../reset-min.css"</a> /&amp;gt;<br></code><br>I don't know if this behavior is documented anywhere (probably is). I just happened across it last year while experimenting with YUI's CDN-hosted CSS.</p>
