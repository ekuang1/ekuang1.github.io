message: <p>@SS, I had a similar problem using some of the jQuery UI stuff, where it broke the UpdatePanel. The reason is that when the jQuery UI generates the required HTML elements, it often moves and  appends content to the body of the document (at the bottom), placing them outside of your form tag.  This breaks the AJAX stuff, and probably some regular postback stuff too. (Didn't investigate that.)  Most of the above samples should work fine with UpdatePanel, because they do not move form fields around.<br>I was using the dialog() functionality, and the only workaround I found that allowed me to use the jQuery UI with UpdatePanel was the terrible hack of creating hidden fields outside of the dialog div (that's a regular control with "display:none" set, not an actual "hidden" field, which ASP.NET does not render on the client) and linking the fields in the dialog to the hidden fields, so that their values updated as the dialog fields did.  I then referenced the hidden fields on the server side so that the UpdatePanel continued to work as expected.<br>I didn't use that hack in the final code.  I removed the UpdatePanel and did jQuery AJAX requests to a web service instead.  Much cleaner.</p>
