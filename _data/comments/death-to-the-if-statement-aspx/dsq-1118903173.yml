message: <p>If statements may be natural, but if logic isn't. This particular example is easily prone to an off-by-one or other mathematical errors.</p><p>On the other hand, the LINQ operators are simple and familiar, especially if you've used them regularly. It saddens me that so many .NET developers don't use LINQ for data manipulation. LINQ has been part of the framework since .NET 3.5 so there's no excuse.</p>
