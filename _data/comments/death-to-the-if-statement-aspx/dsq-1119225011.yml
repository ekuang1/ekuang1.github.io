message: <p>Actually put in the manner you put it, and re-reading the article given your leaning I actually do agree and +1 on this basis.</p><p>My initial reaction which was one biased by the examples given (and to be fair the rather incendiary title of this post) that it seemed replacing an if with what ostensibly looks like a wrapped function (which may or may not have an if in it somewhere!).</p><p>So long as the debate is from the perspective of going through my code and seeing if there is a better way to do it, which may involve 'death to the IF statement', sometimes that's not an option (especially compiler specific ifs- C/C++) or appropriate and some of the time the 'IF' is either not needed or a ternary/binary op/switch/reversal of logic is a far more appropriate and less performance draining than a load of ill thought out if/else's.</p><p>Sometimes the budget/sanity isnt there to nit pick through the code and sometimes you are working in a team and if/elses are a little bit easier to document (IMHO) (from experience unnecessarily jumping into a function/object to read the comments from every new line is a PITA and would get you a swift kick in the nuts from most co-workers) and if they arent in some critical part of the code what is the harm? (better doc slower code vs marginally faster code but harder to read). It still feels a little like removing a choice though...<br></p>
