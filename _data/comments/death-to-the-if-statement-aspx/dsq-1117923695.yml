message: "<p>if(you got no code to write){<br>     write pointless posts like this;<br>}else{<br>     do something useful with your time;<br>}<br>Kids writing code these days... (sigh) It has to be declarative, expressive, use patterns (whether it's necessary or not), purely functional or purely OOP... and all the buzzwords that will render their code uselessly unmaintainable in the shortest time.<br>If I were to handle code written by the OP here, I'd quit my job... instead of digging within the codebase just to see where the IF actually is. And I write native C++ myself... I'm not easily intimidated.<br>PS: There's is nothing more expressive than an IF (in programming or life)... as everybody likes choices.<br>PPS: <a href=\"http://CodeProject.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"CodeProject.com\">CodeProject.com</a>'s newsletter pointed me here. It really starts to resemble a gossip magazine. I'll soon unsubscribe IF it keeps up, even IF I've been with them for over a decade. - how expressive I was using IFs ;)</p>"
