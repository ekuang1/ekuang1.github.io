message: <p>I guess you did not understand what I mean. I will try to illustrate. <br>If you read the description of the problem, then it says "...If the number of elements I needed was larger than the number of elements in the array, I needed to pad the remaining space in the resulting array with zeros...".<br>Logical interpretation of that, is to a) take an array elements and b) pad remaining space.<br>So the first sample code does not solve the problem in a way it was described. It means developer was not thinking about the problem and was not putting effort into understanding the problem - up to you if you are happy with a code which is hard to understand...</p>
