message: "<p>Not at all. Ive just found that sometimes the problem becomes mine when using a library that has 'undocumented' shall we say platform bugs, or strange behaviours. Usually the client doesnt care whether its the library implementation the onus is on me to fix it.. not an easy stretch when its something you have no control over other than coming up with your own solution and probably could have done so whilst the client was paying in the main development round. Yes absolutely if something has already been done (DSP algos, FFTs, Hashing algos) then it is appropriate to us them, I wasnt implying not to. I guess its more about choice. Dont get me wrong I think the debate is worth having and yes I should always ask myself 'is it necessary what Im doing', 'is there a better way' but throwing away a screwdriver because a hammer pushes it in quicker isnt a step forwards. Its all about the balance between: yes function x is known to do this and I can implement it for £15 Id be mad to write my own vs I saved £15 but now theres a problem/bottleneck/hardware changed and shite now what do i do?. If your best guess is that the former will happen then by all means go for it, reuse what's already there. As an aside I'm assuming when throwing out the 'IF' statement we are not talking about the compiler specific ifndefs etc</p>"
