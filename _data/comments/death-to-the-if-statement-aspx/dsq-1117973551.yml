message: <p>I was also sent here by CodeProject, and I agree with every point you make. This propensity towards higher level abstraction for EVERYTHING, rather than just where it is applicable to a particular problem domain is a terrible waste of time.</p><p> (The rest of this post is for the original author)</p><p>Not only that, but an IF (Or at least the conditional operator, including the ternary ?), particularly in C++ is the expressive distillation of selection. One of the three primitive operations of all languages (Sequence, selection, iteration) since time began, and is useful, not only because it allows us to deal with the unknown or unwanted at runtime, but also because of it's closeness to the wire. The Ternary operator code in C++ is compiled to blindingly fast machine code for example.</p><p>Removing selection (Which in some cases is a good idea, after all, polymorphism came about because everyone was fed up of those damn CASE statements littering every sub program we ever had to write) entirely for the purposes of creating better code is a misconception at best, and positively bad practice at worst.</p><p>The author of the quoted article also fails to make his point adequately, and instead of this type of recycling, I suggest you read some Booch, Jacobbsen, or, even the Gang Of Four patterns book, which is almost full of patterns where polymorphic hierarchies orthogonal to one another help to eliminate the kind of control structure which is eminently bad, rather than trying to eliminate genuinely useful conditional code.<br> As an aside, I wonder how many C++ programmers would share our view. Obviously, the language in question plays a large part, and when I read the above example, I just implement a std Vector with a conditional (If vector.size &lt; n) resize (n) in advance of use, but because I know that this is an expensive operation if the Vector's capacity is exceeded by the resize, I avoid it wherever possible.<br>Will be checking back to see what other's think, and regardless of anything else, keep posting. Debate worthy content on the internet is always a great thing, particularly when it extends to more than 140 characters.......</p>
