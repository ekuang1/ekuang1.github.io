message: <p>Same as CodeProject and C++. I agree with you. Closeness to the wire is an amazingly apt expression. My thoughts after the rage dissipated were apart from the obvious replace everything with a function and who cares what the function actually does right?! Coding is an artform and getting rid of bare bones conditional branching just because the text looks ugly or because im too much of a tight arse to maintain my own code or at least the bits that resemble programming and not extraction upon extraction and lots of .() but know knowledge, homage, reverence to the actual algo working away underneath it all. ANYBODY can type code into a page, five minutes on Stack overflow and a liberal copy paste and anybody can make anything work. BUT working is not the point (at least not for me) it should be elegant yes, but in a logical sense not creating wasteful iterations, optimal design in memory and processor during runtime not in compilation. Optimising isn't having 200 lines of code rather than 2000 just because it 'looks nicer that way'. Well written, well designed, carefully crafted (and usefully commented) code is a thing of beauty not the size of it or how the syntax looks. Anyways I ramble. Maybe i just love the if statement too much..</p>
