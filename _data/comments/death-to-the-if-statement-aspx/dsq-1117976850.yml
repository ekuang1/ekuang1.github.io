message: <p>This is true, only when dealing with a given problem domain, which is not when the author of this or the quoted article actually say though. Everyone agrees that declarative and functional programming really scratches the spot when it comes to being easier to pick up for the novice, easier to maintain a full vocabulary of any given domain, and generally less demanding to the human brain in dealing with syntactic idiosyncrasies, but to offer up the opinion that conditions make code inherently worse, and that they should be optimised away is surely not right?</p>
