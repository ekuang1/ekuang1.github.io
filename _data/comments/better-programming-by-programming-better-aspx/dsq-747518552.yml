message: <p>While I think there are "problems" with programmers or at least with <a href="http://www.edmblog.com/weblog/2006/11/the_problem_wit.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.edmblog.com/weblog/2006/11/the_problem_wit.html">our expectations of them</a>, I do think that most people don't want to write code <a href="http://www.edmblog.com/weblog/2007/01/does_everyone_e.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.edmblog.com/weblog/2007/01/does_everyone_e.html">, and could not if they wanted to</a>. The fundamental problem is that programmers and business users have a different perspective <a href="http://www.edmblog.com/weblog/2005/08/different_persp.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.edmblog.com/weblog/2005/08/different_persp.html">that makes it hard for them to collaborate</a>. Yelling at programmers won't help.<br>JT</p>
