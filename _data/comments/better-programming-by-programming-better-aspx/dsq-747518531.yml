message: <p>Interesting posts (yours and Jeff's), and I think the topic really is far more massive than a few studies and the definition of a percentile. What makes one better than the other anyway? Lack of errors? Fewer lines of code? Better logging and exception handling? Scalability?<br>I would argue that if you asked Mr. Tech and Mr. Business what they thought about their programmer - you would get some vastly different opinions on the concept of a "better programmer".<br>I'm the perfect example of this paradox - some of my clients think I walk on water; developers I've worked with think I'm the hack of the century :). <br>Maybe it's time to put this altogether into some quantifiable measure - how about the "Haack Index"? <br>"Dude, what's your Haack?"<br>"Wow, that guy has a SICK Haack."<br>"Phil Haack just published his new site - 'Are you Haack or Not?'"<br></p>
