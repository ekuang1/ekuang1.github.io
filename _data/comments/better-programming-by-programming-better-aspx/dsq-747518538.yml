message: <p>I think to a large degree your programming skills are determined by factors that are not programming specific.  While effortful study can improve your skills, not everyone has the drive necessary to put in the effort.  Even with effortful study your programming skills will ultimately be capped by your analytical and logic skills. Similar to the fact that not everyone can wrap their minds around quantum physics, military tactics and strategy, or even linguistic skills, not everyone will be able to understand how to break down a problem into its constituent components that allow you to visualize the solution.<br>I also agree with you Phil, that some programmers are definitely better than others, and it doesn't take a genius to be able to determine that fact.  That is not to say that you can specifically quantify a programmer's skill, but it is possible to determine that some programmers fall somewhere in the 90th+ percentile range and others are in the bottom quartile, and if you don't think so then maybe you fall into the latter group rather than the former ;-).</p>
