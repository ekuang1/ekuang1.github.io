message: <p><strong>ability to think and passion</strong> are only differentials between two programmers. any one can code... if can't code sure as hell can copy paste someone else work. <br>this has nothing to do with programming itself. can you think logically? can you see beyond the specification in front of you to realize what will actually help person get his task done easily. i agree with jeff when he says you become better programmer by understanding the big picture.  <br>you mentioned Linus Torvalds as example, is he a great programmer because he wrote a piece of code which others had already working for them(their were os's before linux)? No, he is considered great because he made it public, provided others a chance to contribute and hack OS of their dreams. Above all he made it work successfully, any one will respect him for that. he understood the big picture, has great ability to think and he is passionate about programming.<br>now let's take this issue of percentile, you know all the functions available in a programming language(let's take java as example ;) ), you know all the correct syntax, nifty language features, you will still produce crap, may be good crap because language forces you to follow good practices. while you don't know most of these details and you can produce good code... after all what are documentations are for, earlier MIT hackers are their to prove this(refer hackers by steven lee).<br>i don't know everything a language has to offer but when i have a problem to solve then i  look into documentation to understand how i can solve it.<br></p>
