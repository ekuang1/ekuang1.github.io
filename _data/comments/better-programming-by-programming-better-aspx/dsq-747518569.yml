message: <p>I enjoyed your blog post; it was well researched.  :)<br>I've read a lot of books about talent in the last few years and particularly enjoyed Bounce (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bounce-Federer-Picasso-Beckham-Science/dp/B004NSVE5U/ref=pd_sim_b_7" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.amazon.com/Bounce-Federer-Picasso-Beckham-Science/dp/B004NSVE5U/ref=pd_sim_b_7">www.amazon.com/.../ref=pd_sim_b_7</a>) which draws from the conclusions of many other books and studies (including the Erickson study you quoted).<br>Most people don't believe that 10K+ hours of purposeful and effective practice could turn a seemingly mediocre developer into an expert but I do.  By "effective" I mean that it has to generate feedback, which is often hard to get without help from a buddy or mentor.</p>
