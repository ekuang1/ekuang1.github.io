message: <p>@Brad, I'm starting to regret using the term "percentile". I meant that in the abstract.<br>Let's use chess as an analogy. When you are an average player, you have tons of room for improvement. But when you are a grandmaster, you start to reach the limit of how much you can improve. You can train harder and harder, but you only improve by inches, rather than leaps and bounds.<br>That's all I meant by "diminishing margins of return". Another way to look at it, is you still have to keep working at it <strong>just to maintain your level</strong>. That's why it's hard to improve upon a four minute mile, but easy to improve on an eight minute mile.</p>
