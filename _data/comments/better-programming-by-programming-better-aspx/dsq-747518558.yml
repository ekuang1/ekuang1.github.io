message: <p>In the early 1990's, I was probably 30 or 40 percentile.  I was just starting to learn to code, and there were not many programmers, and they were good.  <br>In the late 90's, I was probably 99th percentile, as I got a lot better, and demand for programmers flooded the market with new 'programmers' looking to find money or just find a job.<br>When the bubble burst, I probably moved down a few percentile, as many programmers, mostly those who came for high salaries or easy employment, moved on to other fields.<br>None of this matters.  No one cares what percentile I am in.<br>The effort to get from 99th to 99.5th is very great (assuming the talent of other programmers does not change), but this does not mean it provides diminishing margins of return.  One thing proven time and time again is there is a huge difference between really great programmers and above average.  Who cares if a ton of effort only moves you up a small fraction of percentile, when at the same time, your productivity and quality improves greately?</p>
