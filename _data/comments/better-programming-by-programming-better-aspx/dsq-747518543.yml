message: <p>Actually I would say that the "Great Programmers" probably are more of the people who have time to write blogs and books.  If you think about it if you measure a developer by productivity then a good developer would have projects done faster then others and might encounter idle time where he/she might want to share some of their knowledge with others.  As for the "head in the clouds" developers those are usually the people that will come up with the great idea, because they are always trying to think about doing things out of the ordinary.</p>
