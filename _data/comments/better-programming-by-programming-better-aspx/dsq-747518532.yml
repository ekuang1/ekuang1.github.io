Can the best programmers in the world make mistakes from time to time? What if you want to write good code, but your platform has a bug or quirk that requires you to write hackey workarounds? (IMO, 90% of all code is workarounds in the framework.).<br>Until you can quantify code, you can't say one programmer is better or worse than the other. It's like art.
