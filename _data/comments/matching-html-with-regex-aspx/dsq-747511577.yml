message: <p>My point exactly... Your original expression works quite well once you turn single line mode.  It was failing not with the whitespace but rather the dot expression.  <br><br><br><br>The additional alternation just adds complexity without buying you anything.  Why?  The \s syntax is nothing more than a short cut for a character class containing \n.  Thus, you're effectively repeating yourself.<br><br><br><br>Try the expression "x\s*y" (no quotes) against <br><br><br><br>x<br><br><br><br>y<br><br><br><br>Even without single line mode on, you will get a match.  On the other had, a dot would 'fail' without it.<br><br><br><br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/cpconCharacterClasses.asp" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/cpconCharacterClasses.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/cpconCharacterClasses.asp</a><br><br><br><br>Simpler expressions makes everyone happier... :)<br><br></p>
