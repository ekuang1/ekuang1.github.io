message: <p>@Adam, at your first point, I'm not sure I understand. At the very least, I still think that when I plugin a USB enabled UPS, and open up the UPS tab of Power Options in Control Panel, that it recognize my UPS there.  I wouldn't mind its own system tray applet if it provides features that Windows XP doesn't. Also, this program wrote settings to the Program Files.<br>To your second point, I think that's why Vista has the new "Saved Games" special folder. So for Windows XP, you have a great point. For Vista, used the Saved Games folder.</p>
