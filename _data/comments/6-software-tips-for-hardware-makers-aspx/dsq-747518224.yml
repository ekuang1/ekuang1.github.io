message: <p>Two slight rebuttals:<br>1. Part of the UPS problem is the fault of Windows. That system isn't necessarily capable of doing what you want it to. Windows Vista has improvements in that area and treats a UPS exactly like a laptop battery (so it fully integrates with power schemes, etc).<br>So they had to change the OS to support it working seamlessly.<br>2. The My Documents thing is problematic when you have an application that saves data automatically, such as a game. In the case of a game, you don't get a browse dialog to choose where to backup. In that case, saving to Program Data isn't the best choice since that directory is not part of common hardware or software backup solutions. So you put your stuff in Program Data, and your customers' external hard drive with the 1-click backup button won't pick up your save games.<br>That said, I think the number of times where the user documents folder is the correct place is way less than AppData. Just pointing out that a blanket "never store anything in documents" is appropriate.<br>(As a note, I LOVE the fact that Neverwinter Nights 2 saves in the Documents folder. I didn't have to go digging to find out where the saved games were, my backup automatically backed up my save games)</p>
