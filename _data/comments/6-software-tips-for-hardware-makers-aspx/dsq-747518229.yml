message: <p>And also add this:<br>Please don't install some useless softwares or trial applications on your hardware.<br>I just received a Dell laptop for my sister from states.  It's full of useless small applications (high speed internet, dial up mode manager, etc) as well as 30 (or 90, I can't remember) days Office 2003 trial.  I can install whatever I want or at least I should have a choice to ask you to install these apps for me for free.  For almost 2-3 hours I was uninstalling these apps for my sister to let her study for her exams.</p>
