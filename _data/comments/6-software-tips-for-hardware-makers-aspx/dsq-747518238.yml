message: <p>I'm only too happy to see I'm not alone in this :)<br>I recently bought a Packard-Bell that would have been pretty decent if it wasn't for the crappy OEM version of XP that came with it, crippled down by all sorts of totally useless bells and whistles, and NO backup tools...<br>Bad thing is, the dorks that are ultimately responsible for selling us this sort of crap will never be influenced one bit by ranting -- we really have to do something about it, like keeping a list of offenders as suggested above.  Those fatcats will only be impressed by their sales curve going down.</p>
