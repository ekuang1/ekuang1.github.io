message: <p>One limitation with the example that you explain is that it's not truly asynchronous. You know exactly when the event is supposed to be raised. <br>Things get trickier if the callback could happen a little later. That's were you need some kind of synchronization primitive like ManualResetEvent as Jeremy was saying.<br>To handle that case, I found a generic solution which takes care of the synchronization for you and also works with more complicated scenarios.
