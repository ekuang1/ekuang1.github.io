message: "OK so, I have within my VM a list of objects that is effectively a list of tuples {string, boolean}. I need to control the boolean with a checkbox, as ever this is throwing up problems that are leading me to the need for a JS solution to what should in theory be dealt with by MVC Model Binding. I accept that checkboxes in HTML are badly thought out in the first place, but be that as it may.    \r\n\r\nso to code: \r\n @for (int i = 0; i < Model.ProductGroupAssignments.Count; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        @Html.HiddenFor(m => m.ProductGroupAssignments[i].ProductGroupDescription)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n----\r\n@for (var i = 0; i < Model.ProductGroupAssignments.Count; i++)\r\n                            {\r\n                                <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ProductGroupAssignments.Index\" value=\"@i\" />\r\n                                <span>@Model.ProductGroupAssignments[i].ProductGroupDescription</span>\r\n                                <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"ProductGroupAssignments[@i].AssignedToContact\" />\r\n                            }  \r\nHow can I get the checkbox to bind to the AssignedToContact Boolean using this method please?\r\n\r\n"
