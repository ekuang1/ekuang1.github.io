message: <p>Like Terry, I want to know how to properly use ModelState.AddModelError(key, errorMessage) with this. For example,<br>ModelState.AddModelError("CategoryID", "Product category does not exist");<br>doesn't work because it should be something like<br>ModelState.AddModelError("products[42].CategoryID", "...");<br>However, the index (42 in this example) doesn't seem to be available to the controller.<br>Suggestion?</p>
