message: <p>@Trevor<br>Me too. Trying to figure out whats causing it. <br>I noticed this:<br><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=2540" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=2540">www.codeplex.com/.../View.aspx?WorkItemId=2540</a><br>Is there a work around example we can get? Even with Bind include narrowing down my list it still causes it.<br>Thanks.</p>
