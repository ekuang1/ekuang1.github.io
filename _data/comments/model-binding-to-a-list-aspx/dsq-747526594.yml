message: <p>Anyone asking about MVC 2 here's the answer. I'm working on an app that uses <a href="http://Asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Asp.net">Asp.net</a> MVC 2 RC2 and the BEST thing is, this technique still works as in previous version. I'm able to bind complex objects to a List&lt;T&gt;.</p>
