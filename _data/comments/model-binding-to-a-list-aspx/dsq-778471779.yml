message: "<p>I've noticed it too. The reason is indexing. If you are deleting the 3rd row before submiting you have 4 rows with hidden indexes: 0, 1, 3, 4. And when you submiting form something goes incorrect. But if before submiting you edit hidden indexes for last 2 rows and make them: indstead 3 - 2. Instead 4 - 3. And then submit. Here you got correct submiting result. So the the solution is to edit this indexes in javascript after delet clicked. But it's workaround. If someone bring more cute solution I will be happy)</p>"
