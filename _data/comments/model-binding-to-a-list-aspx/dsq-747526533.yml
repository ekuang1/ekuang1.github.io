message: "<p>I recently wrote a content moderation system using MonoRail which used a similar binding strategy.  I was wondering if/when ASP.NET MVC would support it.  It has a similar syntax to your example, although it only deals with arrays rather than ILists (fair enough really - you're only going to have had a fixed number of things posted back).<br>The use case for us was this: moderators need to lock and work on a batch of 10 blog comments/forum posts at once.  They accept/reject this content by selecting an action from a drop down, and can amend the content to make it suitable for publication.  Once this is done, all 10 items - along with the actions taken - are posted back to the server.  An appropriate ModerationAction DTO is used to pull this data back.<br>If this kind of functionality had not existed in MonoRail, we'd have had to write it (it was a non-negotiable use case), so I'm pretty pleased to see ASP.NET MVC is getting it.  As to the lack of helpers here, I'm not sure that's huge.  I got by just generating the [indexes] from the (NVelocity) view with a variable.</p>"
