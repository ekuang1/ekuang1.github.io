message: Twelve years later this is still a hot topic! This is pretty cool - especially the solution for non-sequential indices, but in my scenario I need the user to be able to add items to the list before it's posted back to the server and I don't think this article covers a way to handle that. The only thing I can think of is to use Javascript to inject indexes into the markup when the form is submitted.
