message: <p>Thanks for this nice post.<br>lets suppose that the list of books are part of a buy order to order those books to any provider.<br>we will list those books, and will select the provider from a combobox,  to set the id of the provider that is a value for the whole list an not a value for each book.<br>How do we do that?</p>
