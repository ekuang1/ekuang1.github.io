  Thanks again.



  Please, I have an issue posting several Collections of Complex Types.



  For instance, I need to post a Collection of a  Candidate's Work Experience and Qualifications.



  The problem is it always posts the highest number of Collections.



  If I make 2 entries for Qualifications and 5 for Work Experience, it posts 5 items in the Qualifications though I made ONLY 2. The other 3 items will just contain null for other.



  Please, help!!!
