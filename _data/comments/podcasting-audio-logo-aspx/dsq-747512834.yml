message: <p>We supply Audio Logos, Idents and Stings for precisely this sort of thing. Podcasters and others need a way of structuring a show to make it sound professional. Adding in chapters and sections really does work and if your budget does afford it then using some good audio and idents can really help you to establish a brand and a presence as well as enable users to remember you.<br></p>
