message: <p>From this post and your previous post, it appears that 2 design flaws are identified:<br>A) no compiler warning of conflicts between overloads and optional parameters (unlike VB)<br>B) optional parameters are compiled to and persisted with the callers; not adapter pattern.<br>Until enforcement can be built into the compiler, would you support the follow rules?<br>1) not to mix overloaded methods with methods that use optional parameters, use only one or the other. (workaround for flaw A)<br>2) if methods do use optional parameters, the caller must use named parameters in conjunction. (workaround for bug A)<br>3) don't use optional parameters in public or protected methods; only allow use for private or internal. (workaround for flaw B)</p>
