message: <p>Your neighbors to the west are heading to Puerto Vallarta as soon as I get home.  A week of lounging on the beach, drinking Coronas, snorkeling, and mountain biking in the jungle.  Paradise.  It's on the Pacific so the water is not as clear and it's not as reliably warm, but the flights are cheaper and the town is less touristy.
