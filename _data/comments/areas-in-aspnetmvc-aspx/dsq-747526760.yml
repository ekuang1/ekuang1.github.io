message: <p>Looks great Phil.  I was just looking into this a few hours ago wondering if it was possible.<br>This should make it much easier to migrate "class" webform apps to MVC.<br>I also want to second Andrew's idea of making it easy to combine multiple MVC applications to make a single site.  In addition to the Blog/Forum situation I think it would be a good way for commercial web apps to offer plug ins or modules.</p>
