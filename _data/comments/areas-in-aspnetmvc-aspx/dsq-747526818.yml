message: <p>Turns out my issue was only with strongly typed views.  I finally found the error, with a little hint from <a href="http://forums.asp.net/p/1378448/2906187.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://forums.asp.net/p/1378448/2906187.aspx">here</a>.<br>With the RC release, there is some new settings in the web.config file under /Views.  If you copy that file under the /Areas/Area/Views folder, then the strongly typed views with no code behind works perfectly.<br>Good luck!</p>
