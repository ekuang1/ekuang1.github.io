message: <p>Excellent work!<br>I think the method of building a website out of seperate applications (modules) really needs to be a strong convention. I really enjoy building websites with ASP.NET MVC in comparison to WebForms. <br>However, I recently tried Django to build a couple of apps, so that I could feed my experience of using a more mature mvc-like app into my <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc projects. What came across was that you could build a website out of multiple applications very easily.<br>Building a website out of multiple apps in ASP.NET MVC has been a bit of a chore so far. The extensibility points are there, so if I wanted to do my a website, and roll my own blog, forums it would be easy enough. However what we really need, is to be able to drop in applications that have already been developed.<br>So, if I want to develop a social community website I would drop in open source components/apps/areas like SubText MVC, Forums MVC. I don't see an easy way of doing this right now, although I know its early days.</p>
