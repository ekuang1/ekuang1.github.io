message: <p>Phil, did you ever get this developed further? Right now I'm looking at several separate MVC web apps in my solution, but sharing masterpages and css across projects is a real pain. (I do it with a Subversion trick.) I think areas and nested areas are the best way to do what I want. Thanks!</p>
