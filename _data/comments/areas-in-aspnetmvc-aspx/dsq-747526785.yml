message: <p>Nice post Phil.  This is something I have been interested in for awhile and happened to stumble upon it thanks to ScottGu's Blog.  What is the likely hood and/or possibility of making these "Areas/Modules" bin deploy-able?  I would think that you would have to use a compilable views and a view engine like Spark.  This would seem to make the inclusion of "Areas/Modules" extremely easy.</p>
