message: <p>I did it in an ASP.Net Framework i'm writing in my spare time.<br>You can create several different applications each one deployed in a set of custom assemblies (xcopy deployment). Every assembly can implemente one or more application ad every application can add new routes. By now is much more a proof of concept but it works since Asp.Net preview 3.<br>I plan to release some "real" framework (maybe with some help) in Q1 2009.<br>You can grab some sources from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ecosystem15/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://code.google.com/p/ecosystem15/">http://code.google.com/p/ecosystem15/</a><br></p>
