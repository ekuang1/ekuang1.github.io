message: '<p>We did something similar to this on my current contract re: overridable views and areas, as our application essentially needs to "reinvent" parts itself each year (different set of business rules, different potential flow, different additions/subtractions to or from the form elements).  <br>To Steve Mason: I have it working with the strongly typed Actions so if you want to chat further about it just drop me a twitter or something.</p>'
