message: <p>I forgot to say that the whole app is compiled (static resources, scripts, views, controllers, masterpages) and deployed as embedded resources. By now i've implemented a virtualpathprovider to mix filesystem and embedded resources, so you can easily create a portal just mixing the apps you want to deploy from an application library (or in the future from an application store :)</p>
