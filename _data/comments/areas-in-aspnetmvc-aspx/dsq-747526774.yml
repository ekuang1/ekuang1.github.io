This is the neatest solution to app areas that I've seen so far in ASP.NET MVC.<br>It gave me a few ideas about how I'd tweak this design, which I've written up at <a href=\"http://blog.codeville.net/2008/11/05/app-areas-in-aspnet-mvc-take-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://blog.codeville.net/2008/11/05/app-areas-in-aspnet-mvc-take-2/\">blog.codeville.net/.../app-areas-in-aspnet-mvc-...</a><br>@People posting about subcontrollers: It's not really related.
