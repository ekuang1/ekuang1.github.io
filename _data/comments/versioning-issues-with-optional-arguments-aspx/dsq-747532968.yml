message: <p>I found this really informative. I started as a C# developer and moved across to VB.NET 2 years ago. At first I hated VB's optional parameters and thought overloads were better as they are a more defined statement of the intended use of the method.<br>Gradually I've started to use VB.NET's optional parameters more, but it's interesting to read that they were added to C# for a specific purpose and are not necessarily intended for general use.<br>I guess it's now the same situation with C# as VB.NET - think carefully before using. It's often better to avoid them I think.</p>
