message: <p>I remember having arguments with the VB guys back in the .NET 1.0 days and saying how evil optional arguments would become if they were allowed and praising Anders and C# for not making that mistake.<br>I guess eventually the Office team either pulled rank on Anders, or he finally got tired of fighting them :(<br>I think this will decision (to include optional params in C# in .NET 4) will go down as one of the worst decisions in the language. Strong words, I know, but the impact of it is also pretty strong.</p>
