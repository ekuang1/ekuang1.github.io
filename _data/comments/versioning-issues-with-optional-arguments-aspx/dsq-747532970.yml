message: <p>@Dorian - I too am a C# guy living in a VB world at my current job.  I avoided Optional parameters for awhile as well, favoring overloads, but the truth is that I eventually came around and now believe that Optional parameters are more readable and use them often, but only for one specific scenario - if one method calls another method just to supply the additional parameter.  For example:<br><code><br>Public Sub DoIt(ByVal s As String)<br>   DoIt(s, 3)<br>End Sub<br>Public Sub DoIt(ByVal s As String, ByVal i As Integer)<br>   ' Whatever....<br>End Sub<br></code><br>This code is so much more verbose and less readable than just doing this...<br><code><br>Public Sub DoIt(ByVal s As String, Optional ByVal i As Integer = 3)<br>   ' Whatever....<br>End Sub<br></code><br>Now that C# has this, I think the same rule applies.  Only use optional params if you're just overloading methods that call each other.  Or, if you're making COM calls, but seriously - is that really a huge segment of the market anymore other than perhaps for Office automation... Microsoft could make that go away by providing a CLR API with a version of Office any day now... seriously MS, where is it?</p>
