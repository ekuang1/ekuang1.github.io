message: <p>It's important to note that if you do change the BasePageType and create a custom implementation of WebViewPage then you need to extend the generic and non-generic classes separately.  I had a pretty tricky time figuring out why my some of my expressions weren't able to do type-inference on the typed view&lt;viewmodel&gt;.  After adding RenderSection methods to both CustomWebViewPage and CustomWebViewPage&lt;TModel&gt; i was back in business, great article.</p>
