message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Just want to point out that you should be careful with this code, because unless you have some special routing rules in place, you've just introduced a vulnerability! :(<br>Say I upload a file called haacked.aspx, then I can just browse to &lt;site&gt;/uploads/haacked.aspx and execute whatever c# code I want on your server.<br>You should probably either:<br>a) make a note of this in your post so that it doesn't bite people who use this code <br>b) move the upload path outside of the webroot or <br>c) include some fancy routing rule to stop this  <br>Cheers :)</p>
