message: <p>Great article helped me a lot but my only issue with it is where you're storing the files, I'd recommend to anyone following the tutorial to create a folder in your solution for example images, then a sub folder called uploads and then replace App_Data with images in the path.</p><p>Just the App_Data folder is meant to be used for database files not images, documents etc.</p><p>All in all though spot on.</p><p>Cheers</p>
