message: "<p>To answer the questions about forms with mixed data (files and text fields), I believe I have the answer:<br><a href=\"http://bloritsch.d-haven.net/articles/2010/10/06/asp-net-mvc-2-uploading-files\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://bloritsch.d-haven.net/articles/2010/10/06/asp-net-mvc-2-uploading-files\">bloritsch.d-haven.net/...</a><br>Basically, you can use a any model you choose.  As long as there is an HttpPostedFile property that matches your file upload control you are all set.  Validations will even work (i.e. you can make the file upload a required field).  It's pretty snazzy.<br>Just a note: it appears that HttpPostedFile only uses the last part of the file path to identify itself.  The raw HTTP request has the full path of the client's file while Asp.Net only sees fit to give you the last part.  I'm uncertain if my Model approach solves the problem of two files with the same name and different directories.  I haven't tested that.  It does make it easy to have some of the file upload fields required and others not.</p>"
