message: <p>Hey Phil, <br>When I followed your example, I found that it uploaded several files without error, however when I attempted to upload an executable file as Thani suggested earlier I got an error.  I can't even break into the controller code to find out what the problem is.  If I can't upload EXE files, what other file extensions are not allowed?<br>Can you please shed some light on this subject?</p>
