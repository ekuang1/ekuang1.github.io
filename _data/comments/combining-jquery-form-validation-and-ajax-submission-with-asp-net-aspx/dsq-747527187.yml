message: <p>Thanks Phil.<br>I've been using the jquery form plugin with validators and it's worked well.<br>Other worthwhile plugin's to explore:<br>jquery mask<br>jquery jqmodal - great for modal dialogs (<a href="http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/">http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/</a>)<br>jquery blockUI<br>Now, what I've done personally is wrap this functionality up into Html helpers.<br>ie.<br>Html.Dialog()<br>Additionally, adding 'ajax' validation support like above, I attach helpers to the normal forms (rather than create a separate 'ajax form helper').  That part is nice because it's easy to encapsulate all the validation scripts, etc... in the helpers.<br>Glad to see jquery get some press - it's an incredible library - good support from the community - and truly 'unobtrusive'.<br>I think MS should create a jquery plugin to do the ms ajax 'proxy' scripting - it's the one part of the ms ajax library that I like.  <br>Even better - ask Nikhil Kothari to include it in his Script#   :)</p>
