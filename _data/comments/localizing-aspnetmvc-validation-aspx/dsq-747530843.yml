message: "<p>I've got a stupid question: is it possible to replace all of the english text around the validation errors with errors in a different language. WITHOUT using data annotations?<br>We've built a web application which currently only supports one language (dutch).  It will eventually be globalized, but the immediate problem is that the error messages are all (US) English.<br>It's not really efficient use of time to add several thousand attributes to view models just to change a dozen string constants..</p>"
