message: <p>How do I go about this problem - I have 2 date time values in my model and when I go to insert a new project the start date and end date validation error messages say that the format is incorrect. Im in the UK and add them as 30/05/2010 but the error message says its invalid and the format 05/30/2010 is invalid.</p>
