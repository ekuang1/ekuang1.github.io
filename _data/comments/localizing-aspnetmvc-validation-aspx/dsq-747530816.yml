message: <p>I'm unsure how your example is localized. All you've done is hard-code Spanish strings in the resource file instead of hard-coding English ones in the main source. To be localized, you'll have to be able to switch to culture-specific strings at runtime. In the past, you could do this with multiple .resx files and by using the ResourceManager - is this no longer possible in MVC?<br>Why not follow the instructions here, which describe multiple approaches, including using the culture info exposed by the browser visiting your page:<br><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905797.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905797.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905797.aspx</a><br><a href="http://quickstarts.asp.net/QuickStartv20/aspnet/doc/localization/localization.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://quickstarts.asp.net/QuickStartv20/aspnet/doc/localization/localization.aspx">quickstarts.asp.net/.../localization.aspx</a><br>MS should produce some best practices for localizing MVC based apps if the existing ASP.NET methods no longer work.</p>
