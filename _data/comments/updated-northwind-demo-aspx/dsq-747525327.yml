message: <p>Sorry, I should have added that it's the Product parameter in EditProduct (the POST version) that seems to blow up the app.<br>I was looking to implement this sort of automatic object inference in my own edit method, but again received the same error as mentioned above.<br>Basically I just want to find a good "edit" scenario example that works, with the simplest possible code, and this would seem to fit the bill.<br>Thanks for reading.</p>
