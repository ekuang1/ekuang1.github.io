message: <p>Hello,<br>I can't get the demo to work on the latest version of the framework. I'm getting a "StackOverflowException" when saving on the "Edit Product" screen.<br>I was trying to implement an edit in my own app and followed the example here, but in both projects I get the same unhandled exception error.<br>Any ideas?</p>
