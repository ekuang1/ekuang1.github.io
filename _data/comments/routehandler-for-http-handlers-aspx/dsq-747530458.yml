message: <p>I had been using a ASPX page with no content just to send some basic output to the response stream (for a simple variables within CSS files parser system that used the MapPageRoute method) but now I have this streaming the output directly. This is so much cleaner and seems to be miles faster. I would have never thought of this solution - thank you!</p>
