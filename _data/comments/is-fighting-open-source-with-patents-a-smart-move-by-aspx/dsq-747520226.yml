message: <p>MS will not sue customers because it would mean revealing which patents they think are infringed. Once they would do that it would only be a matter of time before all offending code is removed from the newest releases of Linux, and patches are developed to change it in current distributions.<br>If we know what we are infringing, we can rebuild it - it might be difficult, and time consuming, but it can be done. And it will be done if that's what is needed. We can always change the behavior and functionality in a way that is out of the scope of the given patent.<br>But Microsoft doesn't want the Open Source community to purge the infringements from their products. They want to keep them in their little war chest which they can show to potential customers who consider switching to Linux.<br>This is what happens:<br>You tell MS that you won't be renewing their windows licenes because your office is switching to linux. They respond by threatening to sue you for 200+ patent infringements. Management gets scared, ponies up cash for Windows licences and kills the linux project.<br>It's all FUD tactics.</p>
