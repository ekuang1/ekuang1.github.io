message: <p>@Mike - Yes, I agree that this smacks of FUD tactics designed to scare potential end-users.<br>However, just because I might not directly be targetted (although I have installed Ubuntu on a VM), that doesn't mean I should just sit by and say, "This is fine, it doesn't affect me." <br>I consider myself to be part of a larger community that <strong>*is*</strong> affected by these strong arm tactics. This time, it might not affect me personally, but next time it might.<br>@Jason, nothing is special about Linux that they shouldn't abide by patents. In fact, they take great care to do so.<br>In this case, Microsoft is avoiding specifics because they know the patents will be challenged, and many likely to prove illegitimate. So instead, they are simply creating an environment of fear in an attempt to disrupt a potential competitor, not to protect its own patent. This is the problem here.<br>As Tim Bray points out, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/13/Four-Words" rel="nofollow noopener" title="4 words for Microsoft">in his four words</a> for Microsoft, they should "Litigate or Shut Up."<br>Or even better, work with these projects first to give them a chance to amend the code to be non-infringing, before resorting to the almighty lawsuit.</p>
