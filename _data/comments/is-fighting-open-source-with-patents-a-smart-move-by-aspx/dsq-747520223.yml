message: <p>Well... If MS had some code that infringed on an open source license, you had better believe that the company that made that code would be taking microsoft to court, so i don't see why ms shouldn't be able to.<br>when it all comes down to it, patents should be upheld (to an extent... our patent system is a bit wack!). If i were ms though, i wouldn't be going for money, i would just be approaching the companies and saying "here is what is infringing. we would like to resolve this in a way that will keep your software free. you can attribute these parts to us, or here are some alternatives that you could do." and work with the companies.<br>That will give a better image and most likely strengthen interoperability between ms and oss vendors (like how things went down with novell).<br>All in all, ms never has been good with the "public image" aspect of the company.</p>
