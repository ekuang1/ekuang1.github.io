message: <p>Yeah, I'm not sure how to react on this one either. I think MS is simply afraid that many of their patents are going to be thrown out simply because they were obvious or someone else had clearly had "prior art" but the patent clerk guys decided they didn't care or whatever. So I'm guessing this is just a final attempt to maximize revenue from a horribly broken, exploitable patent system.<br>Reminder that the main issue with Software Patents is that they're essentially just mathematical algorithms and algorithms can't and shouldn't be patented. What are computers? Really big, complex calculators that run implementations of algorithms. (Imagine if someone patented the Pythagorean Theorem or Matrix Math.)<br>The graphical art contained within software, well that's a different thread.<br>Personally I like a lot of the stuff Microsoft does but the whole patent fiasco that's been going on since the 1970's (or whenever it was that MBA's suddenly became a valid degree) and the fact that they're taking advantage of that broken system has always left me somewhat uncomfortable with my decision to support them. I suppose inside I've always hoped they would eventually "get it" and help lobby to change the patent system for the benefit of all society (think anti-Eolas). But this current, new strategy is somewhat disconsering.<br>Maybe Mike Gunderloy is onto something? If Loonix didn't suck so much I might try switching... again. Maybe... someday.</p>
