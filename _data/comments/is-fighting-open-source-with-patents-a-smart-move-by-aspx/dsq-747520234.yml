message: <p>@Jay - On a second reading I guess that I see the same message. My original reading was that it was all focussed on what developers would do and how they would react. I'm not sure that is Microsoft's intent at all. They don't need to enforce anything or sue anyone. They just need to scare potential end-users of software away from developers claiming to use alternative technologies.<br>Developers will stop using it because it doesn't sell. If people don't use software it tends to go away. This is equally true of commercial and Open Source software. <br>This one move could potentially thin out the Open Source alternatives leaving a big company to just come in and sweep up the rest.</p>
