message: <p>I agree that this isn't good PR by Microsoft at all. It's difficult to quantify, but is the amount of cash they might generate from enforcing patents worth the negative publicity this is likely to generate? I doubt it.<br>When you consider the typical person that works on an open-source project, versus a giant global corporation with oodles of lawyers, it just seems ridiculous.<br>Microsoft would be better off fostering good relations with the open-source community and allowing it to keep demonstrating what a fantastic development platform .NET is.</p>
