message: "<p>First time posting here but an interesting discussion.  One thought about the Office Ribbon (since that seems to be one of the pivotal things that Microsoft is being anal about in their patent defense thing):   I personally hate the ribbon anyway, and would not want to license it from Microsoft OR try to mimic it.<br>Instead.... maybe a group of OSS developers, who have a widely varied experience and little if any loyalty to any particular company other than possibly their own, should come up with a brand new style of user interface, that doesn't infringe on Microsoft's interface elements... who knows, the result could be something truly innovative (the Ribbon is not innovative... it's just a slightly new take on the traditional toolbar).  And then patent it so that MS doesn't do it first.<br>Just my $0.02 worth.<br>Mike</p>"
