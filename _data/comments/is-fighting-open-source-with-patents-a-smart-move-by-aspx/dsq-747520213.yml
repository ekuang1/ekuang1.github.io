message: <p>Just a few things, <br>First off with the new Supreme Courts rulings about patents, this does not sound like a good idea on Microsofts part. Microsoft may have patents that are being infringed and they may not. They could be invalidated if push comes to shove. I do not feel that IBM and the others will allow this to happen. Is this why Microsoft does not list the infringing patents specifically, are they afraid that the patents are really invalid. Anyone can write that so and so infringes on my patents, but to actually come out and prove it is going to take lots of time and money. SCO is trying something like this only with code being copied into Linux and look where they are headed. All I can say is why is Microsoft afraid to show which patents are being infringed?<br>Next is that Microsoft themselves are know to infringe on many patents and they seem to do so so often. So they get caught and have to spend a few million to clear it up, how much did they make on that theft in the first place? Microsoft has had their hands slapped many times for infringing on others patents.<br>Why is Microsoft afraid? I think they either need to put up or shut up. Show us the code Microsoft.</p>
