message: <p>Ohhh, it's bad PR!   A bunch of slashdot readers will like Microsoft less!  And their mothers still won't care.  If they ever get jobs, their boss won't care either.<br>If I ever get a time machine, I'm going to hire Jobs &amp; Woz a really amazingly good lawyer, and thus get Gate's ass handed to him on a platter.<br>If anyone at Microsoft had one thousandth of a percent of the respect they claim to have for "intellectual property" then Windows wouldn't exist today.<br>They got rich off other people's poorly defended property, and now they're going to defend that property for themselves.<br>And they'll get away with it, because the big players (IBM, Oracle, etc) rely on the patent system enough that they'll help defend it.<br>If any Linux developers had actually broken into Microsoft and stolen technology, I wouldn't care about them. Any system that makes it illegal to independantly reinvent an algorithm is broken - and noone who has any real power actually cares, because it's broken in their favour.<br>Still, it's good to know that Vista is so wonderful that it can best compete on lawsuits instead of value to the consumer. Er. Um. Interesting.</p>
