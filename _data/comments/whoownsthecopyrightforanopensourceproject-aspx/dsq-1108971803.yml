message: <p>I am so sorry for introducing confusion.</p><p>I did think/mean the *license*, i.e. what makes you say that code you contribute to an open source project is by default agreed to become licensed the same way as the project?</p><p>To clarify, it is "By default, when you contribute source code to an open source project, you are agreeing to license the code under the terms of that project" that I am referring to - I am wondering what sources/facts there are for this statement.</p><p>I have not read that before, and I am under the impression that unless you put a license on the code you give to someone else, it will be without a license. The fact that you hand that code to them won't change that, unless of course it is detailed in some terms of use or similar that you might have signed (e.g. GitHub, in case they have something about this in there).</p><p>Again, sorry for the confusion! :)</p>
