message: <p>One thing that we learned on the DotNetNuke project, is that having a single copyright holder goes beyond just its effect on the code developers.  When working with Web Hosting companies they expressed concerns with having multiple copyright holders for the project as it could lead to problems if some of the copyright holders choose to change their licensing terms.  Ultimately there would not have been a single entity involved in the licensing of the product which could have potentially created problems for the users.<br><br><br><br>When using licensed components, it is easier for a project to insulate itself from the negative impacts of changing licenses, however, when code is threaded throughout a project, it is not so easy to rip-and-replace if the copyright holder changes to an incompatible license.<br><br><br><br>BTW, we follow the FSF model and require contributors to sign a legal document assigning copyrights to PMI.  In the case of some modules, which are now DotNetNuke sponsored projects, we request a split copyright which allows DotNetNuke to continue to develop the contributed code under our license and copyright (even though the original module may continue to be developed and distributed under a separate license).</p>
