message: <p>Hi,</p><p>Articles like this are needed, so kudos for writing one. I have a question though; You write "By default, when you contribute source code to an open source project, you are agreeing to license the code under the terms of that project, but you still retain the copyright." - Can you provide resources/references on this statement? I have read a fair amount about this stuff in general but never found material that showed this being the case (copyright automatically being given to the project when you contribute).</p><p>Thanks!</p>
