message: '<p>So one can hold copyright over their piece of work, which may be put up on say github as public repo, and still have an open source license for the project ?? What I mean to say :  "I have copyright on THIS work but YOU are FREE to distribute or produce derivative work from THIS work, as mentioned by open source license, but cannot use THIS work as it is" ? Something like Copyright + An open source license ?</p>'
