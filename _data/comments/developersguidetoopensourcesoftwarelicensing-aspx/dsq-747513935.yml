message: <p>You should mention the LGPL, too. It's very different from the GPL, and some high profile open source projects use it (SharpDevelop, for instance - <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/01/20/435999.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/01/20/435999.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/01/20/435999.aspx</a>)<br><br><br><br>As I understand it, LGPL is kind of a middle ground between GPL and BSD - closed source apps can use the components, but can't resell the source.</p>
