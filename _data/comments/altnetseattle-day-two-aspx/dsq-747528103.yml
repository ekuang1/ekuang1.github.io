message: <p><a href="http://xUnit.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="xUnit.net">xUnit.net</a> should support the built in runner though. But then you guys could include it in the ASP.NET project template and give support for it etc. It's really the best unit testing framework out there right now. And while you're at it, how about Moq too?<br>Would be pretty awesome, I think it's a win-win...</p>
