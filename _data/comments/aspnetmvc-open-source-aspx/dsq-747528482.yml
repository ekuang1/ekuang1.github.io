message: <p>Good news Phil, looking forward to the day when the project is accepting patches and doing all it's development on the public facing CodePlex box - but baby steps..  Great to hear the boat is slowly being<br>BTW - The license on the CodePlex project is still saying MS Source rather than MS-PL. Might be worth changing that to avoid confusion.<br>Thanks for all the hard work from you and the team and congratulations on the release.</p>
