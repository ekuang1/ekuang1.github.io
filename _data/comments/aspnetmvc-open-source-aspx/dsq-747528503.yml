message: <p>"How would you explain the expected payback for MVC and Forms?"<br>"...most .NET projects run on microsoft stacks"<br>This is the key point. The value proposition to Microsoft for the .NET platform has never actually been the platform itself; after all, you have always been able to install the framework for free. The value is in increasing the dependency on Microsoft tools and systems, which are the real revenue generators.<br>Making MVC open source increases the chances that some development shops, who might otherwise have passed on it (and gone with non-Microsoft open source technologies instead), will end up adopting it. This means more licenses for Visual Studio and other associated tools, more demand for Windows web servers, more books bought from Microsoft Press, more training from Microsoft and its training partners, etc. Just because you don't have to pay for the technology directly doesn't mean that it doesn't have value to Microsoft, and doesn't mean that they are any less committed to it than they are to any other part of the framework (which is all free).</p>
