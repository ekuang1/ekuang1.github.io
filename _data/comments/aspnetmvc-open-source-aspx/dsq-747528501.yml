message: <p>WHY?   Why is this good?  Look, I know that more people can get access and contribute and all that...  but ultimately this means unlimited competition for MS MVC and no direct revenue streams. It also means there will be no hard tie-ins to other MS products that might disclose IP.  I see this as a much weaker committment to MVC by MS than if they'd kept it internal.  They aren't releasing their Forms technology, are they?  Why keep Forms internal and let the whole world have free access to MVC?  How would you describe the difference in committment from MS?  How would you explain the expected payback for MVC and Forms?</p>
