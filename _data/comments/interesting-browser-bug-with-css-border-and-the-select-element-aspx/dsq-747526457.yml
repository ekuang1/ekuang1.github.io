message: <p>Firefox's Html Validator add-on is invaluable when building sites. It's amazing how a small mistake in your markup causes strange bugs you find difficult to spot. A quick run through with Html Validator and you spot them immediately.<br>I use it as yet another Lint alongside the browser's error console (usually firebug nowadays) and JavaScriptLint for checking my AJAX.</p>
