message: "Hey Mr. Haack,\r\n\r\nAwesome post. I wonder how much difference there is between US and where I live (The Netherlands) in this regard. Here it seems as if when you have a pulse and know how to turn on a computer, there will be companies lining up to hire you. From your post, and other posts about job hunting, I gather that there is a lot of effort involved in the US... \r\n\r\nOf course, if you want a job at a \"premium\" employer, I assume it will still take some effort here, but it still feels different.\r\n\r\nI wanted to suggest an edit as per your footer, but the link is dead. Anyway: I think you meant \"If you make it past the screeners\", rather than \"passed the screeners\"?"
