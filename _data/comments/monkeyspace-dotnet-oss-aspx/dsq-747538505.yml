message: "<p>@ mr metro: The \"tiny bit of effort\" refers to using MonoGame to target Windows RT, porting a game (Bastion) that has already been implemented in MonoGame for the iPad. It's not suggesting that the MonoGame code is also standard WinRT-compliant .NET code.<br>I wish I'd been at MonkeySpace. I will definitely make the effort to attend next year.</p>"
