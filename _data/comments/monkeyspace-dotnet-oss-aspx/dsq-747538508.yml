message: <p>I want to know why MS didn't / doesn't support XNA on WinRT right off the bat? Is there some other form of game development included in WinRT that I haven't heard about apart from XNA, or...? How did they expect devs to write gaming apps for WinRT? I'm just curious about this design decision, does anyone have any insights? Thanks,</p>
