message: <p>Nice post and good to see your positive observations on .NET in OSS and beyond.<br>I have a open source WinRT project <a href="http://win8rssreader.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://win8rssreader.codeplex.com/">Windows 8 RSS Reader</a> and if the number of downloads and developer participation is something to go by it certainly looks like .NET is not going down.<br>Wish I could bring my project to MonkeySpace some day,</p>
