message: <p>@Scott I didn't say the perception is true, only that certain moves created this perception. Remember the gap after they announced the JavaScript story for Windows Metro but didn't say anything about C# on Metro? That created this perception. They're still trying to dispel it based on conversations I've had. People had months to form these perceptions and the late C# announcements struck some as being a "turnaround" even though it was likely the plan all along (I have no inside knowledge of this).<br>Also, the huge emphasis on JavaScript strikes some as neglecting C# developers.<br>I do agree that .NET will play a huge part in the new Windows App Store and Windows RT ecosystem. It just feels like this fact hasn't been emphasized enough.<br>@Steve Thanks! Fixed!</p>
