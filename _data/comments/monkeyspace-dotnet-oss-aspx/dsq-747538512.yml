message: <p>Phil you're a saint of the C# community. Cheers!<br>I love C# so Xamarin please keep on keeping on. But please let this community not be dominated by client facing tablet apps. C# has a lot more strength than this space and isn't supported by many cloud platforms or tools. Love you XAML guys you make some great looking stuff but as a developer I know that the first thing that is going to change is the client facing device (and it's hard to keep up). I program with cloud services and won't be writing games or apps for any app store. I mean it's cute and fun. But this isn't where Java or even NodeJS is getting most traction.</p>
