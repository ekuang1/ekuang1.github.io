message: <p>WinRT is not 'a tiny bit of effort' like you said - I've spent several weeks trying to port my existing C# code. There's lots of API's that existed in .NET that don't exist in the Metro version (<a href="http://system.io" rel="nofollow noopener" title="system.io">system.io</a> has changed radically, arraylists, hashtables etc... etc...)</p>
