message: <p>Me again ... I feel like I should elaborate a little from my previous post.<br>It seems like languages at large are trying to solve problems when their strengths are in other places while Oracle crosses its arms and laughs saying in a deep God like voice "hahaha I might have alternative motives but like a software pimp but I'm already on every other platform ... especially the cloud". All the while the countless CTOs say hmmm maybe we should consider selling ourselves and become a whOracle. Not to solve any problems other than being able to get into cloud tooling and platforms beyond Azure.<br>I won't go into examples of where other languages sit in PolyGlot land but I really think C# and Xamarin could be a big secret sauce player to the PolyGlot world. Lord knows I've tried using them but have had to opt for something closer to Windows based each time, thinking hmmm maybe NodeJS, TypeScript and ECMA 6 will save my ass... God forbid a JS way bastardizing an OOP way that we know works better. I think JS can be very useful as how it has matured and community behind it but maybe C# can be a bigger brother in functionality to JS. And maybe we could even learn something from the JS community.</p>
