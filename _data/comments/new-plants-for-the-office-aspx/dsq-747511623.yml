message: <p>Just don't let that bamboo get into Ballona Creek!  Giant reed, or Arundo donax, (a close relative of your little plant) is an aggressively invasive species that we're spending millions of dollars to eradicate from SoCal rivers.  It chokes up river channels, causes flooding, and blocks spawning migration for native fish species.<br><br><br><br>This has been a Public Service Message, we now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.....</p>
