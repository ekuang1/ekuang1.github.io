message: <p>I actually never thought I was much of a bamboo fan until we started looking for an apartment in Singapore.  The apartment we live in has a large planter box with 3 tall stands (10 to 15 feet) of bamboo.<br><br><br><br>Obviously, there was more that drew us to this place than the bamboo, but I really appreciate spending evening sitting outside under it and listening to the birds that nest in it.  Yesterday, I also noticed that a few lizards live in the bamboo too.  The owner of the apartment also placed some lights to shine up at the stands at night, so its quite a dramatic effect.  What I like most about it thousgh is that we can pick out our apartment from several miles away!  Of course bamboo is a thirsty plant, so I pour about 6 gallons of water into the planter box everyday.  Being Singapore, this deluge has to be carefully managed, otherwise standing water will attract dengue fever carry mosquitoes to lay eggs!</p>
