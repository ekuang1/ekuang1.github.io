message: '<p>"The key here is that the burden is ultimately on the developer to be aware of what she is doing"<br>Which is completely antithetical to static typing. Usually the argument against dynamic typing, which is very different from dynamic dispatch (Ruby, Smalltalk, and Objective C are really dynamic dispatch, message based systems rather than dynamically typed), goes like this: "But what if some other programmer passes in the wrong object? I want the compiler to make sure that this type and only this type can be passed to my code.". <br>At which point I say, "Boy, you need to hire some smarter programmers. Who are these other programmers anyway?"<br>The duck typing class looked interesting, but it also seems like a giant reflection macro. ;)</p>'
