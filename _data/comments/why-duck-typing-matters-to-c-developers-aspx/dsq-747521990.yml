message: <p>Unsurprisingly, interface designers can never imagine all the possible applications of their code. They usually succeed in making us do more work than is necessary to adapt their tool to our use.  If I see a bunch of semantically consistent and related objects with really lax or unimaginative interface design and I want to apply my superior foresight but recycle the grunt work why should anybody stand in my way. Wrap the whole thing in {unsafe_duck_bs} and let me proceed. Back in the C days you could shoot yourself without even trying.  Now, I'm prevented from even owning the gun, lest I harm myself. This reminds me a lot of the modern IT guy. He removes all the usability from the software and proclaims the enterprise is safe from all threats. Why should he care that we can't do any real freaking work. Remember your roots people. If we came from C and developed all this great stuff providing judicious use of "power tools" in a language is not a sin. Loosen up a little.</p>
