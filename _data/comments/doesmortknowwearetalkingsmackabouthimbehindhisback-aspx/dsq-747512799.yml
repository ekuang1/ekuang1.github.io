message: "<p>Sorry but its not Mort that's the problem. Its you. Really.<br>See, consider the problem, Mort is an average programmer and he has difficulty learning everything he needs to learn in order to create the quality software you demand. Well, ok, I've got no problem with that... what I have a problem with is that you demand he learns new stuff all the time. I'm sure Mort has gotten to grips with VB6, he knows the tricks and tweaks over time and is comfortable with the language and the IDE. So what do you do? Yes, you tell him all that is obsolete and legacy stuff that makes you heave and that he has to learn a new language.. and framework.. and API... and all the little tweaks and tricks that he needs to make the software work properly. <br>If the designers at MS could make a perfect system then we'd be fine, but they cannot. Understandable, creating software is hard after all, and creating architectural systems is hard too, but changing things only makes Mort's life a lot harder. Now, lets say he's had to learn C# (to pick the current flavour-of-the-month) he only needs to forget to litter his code with try/finally/using statements and he's written below-par code. Just like that. So easy, its not surprising Mort writes poor code. So he gets that drummed into him eventually, and he learns about all the other bits of pieces he'll need to know... do you think he'll be allowed to continue writing C# code with the API he's become familiar with? Of course not - there'll be a new design block, or new server, or new framework that he must start using, new 'features' in the system that he'll have to learn to remember.<br><br>Is it any wonder Mort is in difficulty? *We* need to step up to the plate and realise that writing software is about producing business applications that solve business needs, not anything to do with 'technology' and definitely nothing to do with 'coolness'; we need to let Mort (and ourselves) learn to better use what we have, not become n00bs all over again.<br><br>(an example for you: when MS released .NET there was a flurry of evangelical talk about how great the garbage collector was, how nobody would veer have to worry about memory ever again, just let the GC take the strain for you... and then a few weeks ago one of the DARPA autonomous vehicle robots failed the test due to a ... memory leak. Those Princeton PhD grads who created an autonomous vehicle .. are Morts. What hope for the rest of us?)</p>"
