message: <p>Great entry. This is almost the same conclusion I reached here:<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000272.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000272.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000272.html</a><br><br><br><br>We need to stop paternalizing. Java guys are the worst in this regard, though some of the more zealous C# purists are nearly as bad.<br><br><br><br>Instead of wasting time complaining about Mort and VB corrupting the minds of innocent young developers, we should be pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps.<br><br><br><br>Similarly, time spent arguing about "pure" OO is better spent instilling a culture of hard work and professional investment, so all developers CAN become talented.</p>
