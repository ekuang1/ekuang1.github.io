message: <p>Some would argue that by definition, Mort does not know he's Mort. Furthermore, one could easily extend that and say that even if she knew she was a Mort, she wouldn't respond on a blog she's unlikely to stumble upon. <br>Unlike Morty, I don't *think* I'm a Mort, but there is that sinking suspicion that I'm only fooling myself. And if I were fooling myself, than it's only more indication I am a Mort. <br>*circles!*<br></p>
