message: <p>This is what i refer to as "passion for the art of your job".  if you don't have that, you are Mort.  Though skill is certainly critical, skill is nothing without passion.  Give me an average developer - but one who has passion for what they are doing - and i've got a investment worth having on the team.<br>As for those that have no passion - even the ones with some skill - (to me they are Mort as well) - we need to stop coddling them.  i agree, it's waAay past time to raise the bar so that the average developer is someone we can count on to get the job done - and done WELL.  Instead of trying to accomodate Mort, we need to be showing Mort the door ... before our clients show us the door.<br></p>
