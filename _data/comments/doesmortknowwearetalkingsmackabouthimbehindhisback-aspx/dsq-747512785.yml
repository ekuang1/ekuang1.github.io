message: "<p>I think it's unfair to categorize this as a developer archetype.<br><br>It's more a IT applicants archetype IMHO.<br><br><br><br>The real problem is the fact that everyone with a somewhat university degree and minimal programming experience (I include ppl who studied Turbo Pascal for 2 hours a week - hey look I've made it work - i must be talented), considers him/herself to be applicable for development project.<br><br><br><br>It's like \"I made cookies, hence I call myself a baker\".<br><br>(or the geek version: I made cookies, hence I call myself a webdeveloper ;)<br><br><br><br>I saw this at my first job... I started in 2000 - the year before the end of the \"Golden Years\" for IT people at one of the biggest Belgian dotcom companies , my team consisted of:<br><br>- someone with a master degree in math.<br><br>- someone with a master degree in biology.(a freakin botanist)<br><br>- someone with a master degree in bioengineering<br><br>- 2 \"starter\" peeps with a bachelor degree in IT.<br><br><br><br>They hired these people because they needed the manpower and experienced developers were too scarce and also too pricey.<br><br><br><br>Now comes the -DOH- part:<br><br>- One year later this company looses some important contracts.<br><br>(in my case it was the disastrous 6 months period after the 11/9 crashes, but that's not the point...)<br><br><br><br>- They had to let some people go... (like 90 peeps of the 160, AND they let them go by 2 each week during a year, only to avoid a legal issue when firing a lot of employees at the same time, but <br><br>that's not the point, again ;)...)<br><br><br><br>- They had to pay the university dudes the most, so they let them go first. In the meantime they worked there for 1 year so there CV (resume I think you call it) mentions at the experience section: 1 YEAR PROGRAMMING ASP. (they now call themselves webdevelopers)<br><br>While doing nuthing but rearranging some html and add ASP code to existing webapplications.<br><br>In the meantime dotnet got releases, so they read some dotnet tutorials on the net which results in another CV entry: MINOR EXPERIENCE OF ASP.NET.<br><br><br><br>- They did find another job however... there's always a governement branch/banking company with too much money to spend and too little time to conduct a proper jobinterview.<br><br><br><br>- I am getting so frustrated that I'm almost forgetting my point here ;)...<br><br>In a few years from now they apply for a job at your company. You'd then better ask the right questions and not look at their resume.<br><br><br><br>Keep up the bloggin'!</p>"
