message: <p>"Does Mort even know he’s Mort? Or is the "other guy" always Mort. There’s not much you can do for Mort unless Mort takes the first step and admits that he is indeed Mort." <br>I have to admit, im a mort. Im actually the worst kind too. It felt like you were describing ME in your article. I work at a place with way too much money, i have a mediocre IT-degree, and the best approach i know towards something that even resembles OOP, is how to define a function in PHP. None the less, i have buildt enourmous stuff. Full on CMS, Webshops, even digital versions of the punch in card. It all works, and it works rather well. However, thats also where it fails. For when the day comes were someone discovers a bug, or when it needs general maintanance, they will come to me. If i dont work there anymore, i will give a blatant no. If i still work there, i will probably politelly ask my employer if i could rather clean the toilets with my face. <br>There's a fair chance that not even the best developer in the world could clean up my mess. <br>Don't worry though, i've realised all of this, and im quitting in a few months, so that those who actually know what the hell they are doing can take over - and et paid accordingly.<br>M</p>
