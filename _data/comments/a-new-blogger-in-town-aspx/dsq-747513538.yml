message: "<p>Phil,<br><br>Just checked out CEO Micah's new blog... looking forward to some interesting \"deep thought\" material to read between my normal consumption of tech writings.<br><br><br><br>Speaking of which, I just read your primer: ASP.NET Exceptions 101 for .NET: What and Why (<a href=\"http://www.devsource.com/article2/0,1895,1888558,00.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.devsource.com/article2/0,1895,1888558,00.asp\">http://www.devsource.com/article2/0,1895,1888558,00.asp</a>). That's some good stuff. Coming from a JAVA-centric background myself, I never really knew (nor do I care to) a world w/o exception processing/handling. However, I have no doubt that this article is a great resource for much of the classic ASP &amp; VB audience out there as they move to the .NET framework(s).<br><br><br><br>Great work as always!<br><br>-Steve</p>"
