message: "<p>Actually, it's the same first lesson as always: the client has no idea what s/he's talking about. I'm appalled that the plumber actually TOOK YOUR ADVICE about what the problem was rather than investigating to see for himself. Unbelievable. Who was it, Mario? Luigi?<br><br><br><br>When people come to me with pre-defined solutions in mind, I always re-focus the discussion by asking \"What problem are you trying to solve? What's your goal?\"<br><br><br><br>In this case your goal was to have a toilet that didn't leak.<br><br><br><br>The plumber should have been able to take it from there.</p>"
