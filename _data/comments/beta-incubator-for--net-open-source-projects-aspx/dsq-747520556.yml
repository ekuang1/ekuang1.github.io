message: <p>Weird, I'd commented last week on Channel9 on how MS should hand out MSDN subscriptions to particular open source contributors, but how could you measure and decide; how much code contribution is enough?<br>(Of course part of that is driven by the fact that my subscription has ran out; it was donated by an MVP to me last year)</p>
