message: <p>@Rydal - This is not being run my Microsoft. Who chooses the projects? Good question. For the first project, it will be the members of the community mentioned in Rob's post.<br>Remember, in a way, this is a test run. We hope to learn from this first pass how to make this program work. We've never built an open source support network before. So we're approaching it like an agile software project.<br>@Chris - More good questions! :) I think these are things we all need to think about and consider. My feeling is that maybe we'd have some experienced OSS leaders provide mentoring to others.<br>As for code/design reviews? I don't think the idea is to get that much in the details of the actual code. From Rob's post, it sounds like he sees a few "gaps" where useful open source projects could fill in nicely.<br>So the incubator role might be to create a high level "spec" for such a project and if it happens to align with someone's passion, that person (or persons) can run with it.<br>Now if you ask me, I agree that we should look at supporting existing projects too. <br>Keep in mind that this is not a funded operation. This is a group of OSS project leaders trying to think of a way to help other OSS projects. You're still fuzzy on the idea, because honestly, we're still a bit fuzzy.<br>But a really good way to get clarity on the concpet is to try it out on a very small scale. I think we should set up a wiki to gather these ideas.</p>
