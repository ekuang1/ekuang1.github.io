message: "<p>I found that the <a href=\"http://producingoss.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://producingoss.com/\">Producing OSS</a> is a prime example of someone(Karl Fogel) who is very experienced with open source development and was willing to share.<br>Since I had no experience at all with open source projects I used it to create a few \"prior to launching\" checklists.<br>For example: <br> o) Choose a Good Name<br> o) Have a Clear Mission Statement<br> o) State That the Project is Free<br> o) Features and Requirements List<br> o) Development Status<br> o) Downloads<br>etc. I also refer back to it from time to time.<br>An incubator would be very useful for people to share this sort of experience and build their reputation amongst the open source community. <br>We setup <a href=\"http://sharpforge.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"sharpforge.org\">sharpforge.org</a> specifically to assist with the infrastructure side of running open source projects. To make sure we're building something that is relevant for open source projects we're using it to manage the development of SharpForge.<br>To support the incubator I can offer: <br>  o) free software project hosting on a project by project basis at <a href=\"http://sharpforge.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://sharpforge.org\">sharpforge.org</a>. Thats exactly why it was created and is ready for new open source projects right now. <br>  o) create a new portal specifically for the incubator <br>    eg. <a href=\"http://incubator.sharpforge.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"incubator.sharpforge.org\">incubator.sharpforge.org</a> <br><br><br></p>"
