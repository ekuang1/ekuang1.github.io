message: <p>Ok, fair enough, I'm all for trying stuff out. I think the Incubator should start out with 2 or 3 "lofty" goals - things you *really* want to accomplish and see if you are able to pull them off. That would at least provide the incubator with some direction and the OSS project some guidance.<br>Lemme throw 2 out for good measure:<br>1.) The Incubator will facilitate the OSS Project(s) by introducing the OSS Project coordinator to at least 5 individuals that are viewed as Market Leaders in the OSS Project market space. (i.e. If forums is to be the first one, then the Incubator should farms it's contacts for 5 leading contacts in that space to provide additional market guidance and insight.) This may help minimize the "me-too" syndrome of OSS and open up some opportunities for niche products or something similar.<br>2.) The Incubator will provide to the community at-large a web space where the community can suggest OSS Project(s). 3 Months (or some random number, I'm not going to banter on the details here) prior to the next round of project launch(es), the Incubator will present a "cleaned" list (get rid of redundant entries) for the community to vote on.<br>Questions and ideas, Questions and ideas . . .</p>
