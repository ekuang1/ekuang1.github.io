message: <p>WOW !! great news Phil !!<br>I need to read that again in the morning to know if I understand all the idea :P (is 1.30 am here now)<br>The licenses idea is good and I have a hand up on that, we work hard to keep the filehelpers updated and some licenses can make our work easy.<br>Takes a lot of tiem to maintain and support an open source project, and you know how hard is to balance our pasion for open source projects, the work and the personal life,  some motivation is needed to keep thing alive and running.<br>Here I go with another small idea that maybe you already think, but I want to share it anyway:<br>I feel that the "big problem" is the trust of the community (read here Enterprises) on some open source projects.<br>M$ theact the big enterprices to trust only on them, so is a mantra out there that a library or tool is good if is from M$ or only if is used for more than 1 millon of developers.<br>I think that if you can create a site when some "open source specialists" like you and others great blogers and respected people talk about the main projects, with the best and the bad of each one, so the spirit of the open source raise up.<br>Thats the most important thing to build and ecosystem where the main people guide to others to the right set of tools like the "hanselman tools list" something like that but about open source projects on .NET<br>What do you think about that.<br>Thanks for all, and good luck at your new job<br>Marcos<br>Open Source developers<br><a href="http://www.FileHelpers.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.FileHelpers.com">www.FileHelpers.com</a><br></p>
