message: "<p>This MVC team is really some kind of 'resistance'! Everything you guys do breaks the paradigm ... the old paradigm turned many away from MSFT.<br>It's so refreshing to read all these demystifying stuff. Before now, it was: \"We now give you this feature that will change the way you do this and that\". Now, it is, \"We have provided this feature to give you the option of doing this or that, AND this is how we implemented it, AND this is how you can adapt and modify it.\"<br>Awesome times!!</p>"
