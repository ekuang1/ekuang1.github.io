message: <p>@Sean yeah, you make a good point and in fact, I made a similar argument in a debate with a teammate on this point. He mentioned the implementation detail point which I think is important.<br>ASP.NET MVC was built out-of-band to the ASP.NET Framework. What that means is that we couldn't make changes to ASP.NET itself when writing MVC. For example, we couldn't make changes to the Page class in order to do what we want.<br>If we could have made changes to core ASP.NET, we would not have implemented this feature in this manner. Between you and me, it's a bit of a dirty hack, but one that provides a valuable feature.<br>In the future, when we can change the core ASP.NET bits (aka ASP.NET 4) AND when MVC takes a dependency on those bits, then we can completely get rid of this class.<br>In that case, we'd rather not have to support a class we intend to get rid of, so it's definitely easier on our part to keep it internal.<br>Having said that, we're still open to making it public. As my coworker said, "What's the scenario?". Now, I gave him a scenario, but my opinion doesn't count as much as our customers. And so far, not one single customer has complained that something they were trying to accomplish was broken due to this.<br>Of course, most people didn't even know this was here. Being the mischevious little monkey that I am, I've hopefully shed light on this and if customers start complaining that REAL scenarios that they are trying to do are painful because of this, we'll have more incentive to make it public.<br>However, I just hope we can fix the core framework soon enough that we can simply dump this class.</p>
