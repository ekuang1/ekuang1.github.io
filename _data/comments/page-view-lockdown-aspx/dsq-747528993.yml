message: <p>So, seems that in ASP.NET, we can replace everything with our customized code. This seems to be promising, but I can find no real-world application in which you want to "prevent a developer from injecting an script tag in a View". I mean, maybe that level of extensibility adds no extra value at all to the real-world examples.</p>
