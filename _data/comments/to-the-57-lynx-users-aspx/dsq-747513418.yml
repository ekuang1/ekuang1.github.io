message: "<p>As a blog-spam fighter, i often came accross very strange useragent strings... While not having any PDF or Real-media content, i've been visited by Acrobat, RealPlayer and various others...<br><br><br><br>However, my stats say 48.7% of my audience use IE in various versions (44.8% of total is IE6.0) and 17.5% of my visitors use Firefox, but only 5.8% use firefox version 1.0.4, and <a href=\"http://0.xxx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"0.xxx\">0.xxx</a>% use the latest version.<br><br><br><br>An amazing thing, that gives an idea of the fact those useragent strings are often faked : 0.8% of FireFox users have no identifyable version number!</p>"
