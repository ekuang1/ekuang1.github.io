message: <p>I sometimes still use Lynx when I want to browse docs or download something to a remote server.  It is one of the tools I have installed on all my Linux servers.  <br><br><br><br>Oddly the use of CSS has made Lynx work better rather than worse.  HTML has become less complicated and a lot of the difficult rendering problems are pushed into CSS.</p>
