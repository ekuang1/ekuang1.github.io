message: <p>You have me scared... I use the same feature of feedburner.  I didn't get any emails about the transition to google domains though... and my feed still works from <a href="http://feeds.jeffhandley.com/jeffhandley" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://feeds.jeffhandley.com/jeffhandley">http://feeds.jeffhandley.com/jeffhandley</a>.  I wonder if I'm on a different wave of transitions and should expect troubles soon.<br>What exactly does the redirect result in?  Can people still subscribe via <a href="http://feeds.haacked.com/haacked?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://feeds.haacked.com/haacked?">http://feeds.haacked.com/haacked?</a>  That's how I'm subscribed and your entries are showing up find for me.</p>
