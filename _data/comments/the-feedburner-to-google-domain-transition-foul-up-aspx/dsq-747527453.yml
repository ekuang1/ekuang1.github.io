message: <p>Wow, awhile back I decided to take on the challenge of writing my own blogging platform from scratch in <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a>, it has taken a lot of work to complete all the features that the standard blogging platforms offer including RSS feeds. While I took on this challenge just for the sake of having one and knowing I would learn a lot in the process I have spoken with many individuals whom have discovered issues with the platforms they are on but are married to it for one reason of another, your experience with Feedburner is the same kind of thing. I'm glad I have my own system so I can have complete and full control over this kind of stuff.</p>
