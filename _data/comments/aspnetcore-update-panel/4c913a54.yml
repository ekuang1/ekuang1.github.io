message: "@Ryan because `response.text()` doesn't return the text, it returns a `Promise<string>`. So one way or another, I need to call `then()`, either directly on `response.text()` or by returning `response.text()` and calling the outer `then()`. I like doing the latter because it reduces nesting of callbacks."
