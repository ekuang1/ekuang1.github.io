message: <p>Ah, I guess I needed to RTFM. Apparently posh-git suffers slowdowns with large repositories. Our project is around 700kloc and has 11-12 years of history that has been imported into git from SVN and SourceSafe. The git bash has no such delays, so I guess I'm back to using that. Appreciate the tip none-the-less though. :)</p>
