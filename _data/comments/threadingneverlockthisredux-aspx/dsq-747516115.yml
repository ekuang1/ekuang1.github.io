message: <p>Ah, I see.  Well personally, I never use the lock statement as is because it does not specify a timeout.  Instead, I use the TimedLock because it provides the best of both worlds. <br>It has lock-like semantics (via a using block), but allows you to specify a timeout (like using a monitor).<br>The problem with using a monitor directly is you need to remember to always write the exit code properly by putting it in a try/finally block.<br>And "try/finally" always triggers "using!" in my head when applicable.</p>
