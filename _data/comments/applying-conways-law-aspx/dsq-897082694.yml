message: <p>I am long in the tooth like Conway (first Fortran II course was fall 1968, last course was Cobit5 spring 2013) in the IT space .  Not only does current and past (since 1960's) organizational structures follow Conway's law; but failure to architect as per @jesse_toth has resulted in many organizational cultural classes and resultant software solution failures.  Just applying Conways Law and open source concepts to your current organization provides insight and understanding. Great blog!</p>
