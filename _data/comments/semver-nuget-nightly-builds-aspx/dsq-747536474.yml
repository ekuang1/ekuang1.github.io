message: "<p>@Stoyan I completely hate maven as a distribution/dependency management (Maven is a lot more: the ant-like build \"system\" is nice on the other hand)<br>A lot of companies loose money over Maven but don't realize it, or don't want to realize (yes there is experience behind that statement). But telling a java developer that they waste time with Maven is like telling ... <br>And telling a .Net developer the same about NuGet is almost the same... \"Microsoft endorses it so it must be good\".<br>So yeah I hear you, Nuget is great for solo developers, script-kiddies and the like, ...<br></p>"
