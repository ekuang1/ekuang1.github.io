message: "<p>The scenario you describe seems to be covered by SemVer 2.0.0-rc.1. Which as you can see from SemVer's own version allows dots after the string.<br>Section 11 in SemVer 2.0.0-rc.1 says the following about build versions.<br></p><blockquote><br>A build version MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST be comprised of only ASCII alphanumerics and dash [0-9A-Za-z-]. Build versions satisfy and have a higher precedence than the associated normal version. Examples: 1.0.0+build.1, 1.3.7+build.11.e0f985a.<br></blockquote><p><br>Note that this allows the usage of \"+\" for build versions.<br>Section 12 goes on to describe the precedence calculation:<br></p><blockquote><br>Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor, patch, pre-release, and build identifiers in that order. Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically. Pre-release and build version precedence MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier as follows: identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically and identifiers with letters or dashes are compared lexically in ASCII sort order. Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers. Example: 1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0-alpha.1 &lt; 1.0.0-beta.2 &lt; 1.0.0-beta.11 &lt; 1.0.0-rc.1 &lt; 1.0.0-rc.1+build.1 &lt; 1.0.0 &lt; 1.0.0+0.3.7 &lt; 1.3.7+build &lt; 1.3.7+build.2.b8f12d7 &lt; 1.3.7+build.11.e0f985a.<br></blockquote><p><br></p>"
