The only downside to SemVer is you will need to increment major version ALOT MORE frequently than you would realize if you don't follow SemVer.<br>Seeing as many people like to tie major versions with paid upgrades, having to increment the major version because you renamed 1 property is a bit stiff.<br>This is also potentially something you could evaluate for nuget, to use 4 version #s (matches .NET better too). And just increment the patch # for every CI build. By definition a nightly build should just be a patch increase, otherwise you've already introduced changes that should require a version increment further than a patch.</p>"
