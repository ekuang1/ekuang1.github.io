message: "<p>This right here is actually why I dislike SemVer. It keeps things simple for simple scenarios, but falls apart when you have anything more complicated.<br>Personally, I like date-based build numbers a lot better. My build numbers work as follows:<br>MajorVersion.YYYY.MMDD.TTTT. Then you know everything you need to know about when the build was released. <br>You might be thinking \"wow, you know I really hate it when people reply to a problem with a solution that does not apply/won't get adopted.\" And I would understand. But supporting a different versioning semantic is not what I'm proposing. Well, not entirely.<br>.NEt assemblies support two different versions: The Logical version and the File Version. Each supports separate scenarios. I suggest that NuGet continue to work the way it currently does with versioning, and do not change anything. Instead, support additional attributes, like \"IsPreRelease\" or \"IsNightly\" flags, s well as an arbitrary version string, to allow multiple versions to be in the feed without stepping on each other's toes.<br>In this case, the default public feed would show everything where those flags are off. The Package Manager UI would let you specify if you wanted to include PreRelease or Nightly builds in the feed. This would also have the benefit of being queryable, since the underlying feed is OData.<br>Otherwise, I think trying to cram too much into one version string will just cause more problems further down the line. This way, there can be a version string used for sort order, and a completely separate one for display only.</p>"
