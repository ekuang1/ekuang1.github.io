message: <p>I think it's impossible to argue against Haack's Law.  Coming up with a good way to solve a difficult business problem is never going to get any easier.  You will always need to have someone who knows the modern technologies at a deep level to define the best course of action to achieve the desired solution.<br>I guess that's the reason I like the term "Solution Architect" better than "Programmer" or "Developer"<br>So here is RyanSmith's Law:<br>"No matter how much a person makes, they will always find a way to live right up to their means - thus an individual will always be broke"</p>
