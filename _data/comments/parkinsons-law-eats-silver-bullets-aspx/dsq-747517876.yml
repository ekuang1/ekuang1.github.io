message: "<p>\"Software will be mostly made by putting together small units (components)\" is only half the Lego Programming Idea in these kinds of press articles.<br>If the articles just said that, they (a) wouldn't be wrong, and (b) would predicting what's already long-ago happened, ever since function calls were first invented.<br><br>The full Lego Programming Idea goes something like this:  \"Software will be mostly made by putting together small units (components), AND AS A RESULT, will become simple enough for non-programmers to create\"<br>The reason this is stupid, is because, of course, everything after the \"AND AS A RESULT\".  Putting together small units, inorder to solve a problem, is itself a hard-task, that non-programmers generally can't do.</p>"
