message: <p><strong>@AsbjornM</strong>, That's the same question that I asked in <a href="http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2006/09/23/Laptop_Warmer_Anecdote__Debunkified.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2006/09/23/Laptop_Warmer_Anecdote__Debunkified.aspx">my response</a>... and don't forget - this was a laptop from the late 1990's, so I'd be the hardware specs were really small.<br><strong>@Phil</strong>, Do you have CoComment support turned off? Anytime I post a comment to your blog it fails to show up on my CoComment <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/comments/ussherm" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.cocomment.com/comments/ussherm">Conversations</a> page.</p>
