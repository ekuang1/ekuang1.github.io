message: <p>Of course Thomas is tech support for Verizon DSL. He's in Afghanistan, or someplace like that, getting paid $5 a day, and probably handing that over to Osama. YOur lucky that he can type at all, most over there can't even speak their own language, much less English. Don't you know Verizon follows the American way...... oustsource everything you can to some underpriveleged nation, that doesn't comprehend English, and take advantage and exploit them as much as possible, unless of course your talking about the services your company offers. Then, overate, advertise the moon, sell the customer a seat on the next Space Shuttle, and provide nothing.<br>  And no Mandy, it does not go through the phone line, it is a fiber potic cable ran into your home, you will receive an adapter for your phone just like you would for cable VOIP service, a fiber optic modem for internet, and in some areas, a set top box for FIOS TV, hell they don't even offer the service here, although they advertise the hell out of it, I should be selling this thing, so I can rip off my fellow Americans as well. Isn't the way of our land lovely?</p>
