message: <p>I just signed up for 20/20 FIOS Internet + TV and phone. Verizon told me FIOS is much faster than my current cable provider, Comcast. I have 100Mbps in my wired computer. It is prity fast but sometimes gets slow. I 've been through the difference between MBps(Mega Byte per second) and Mbps (Mega bitper second), but still I cannot get a response about what Verizon offers if 20/20MBps or 20/20Mbps. When I called they asured me it was MBps delivered at the door not at the curb like Comcast(shared cable broadband)does, but the contract reads Mbps. Anyone of you knows what they actually offer if it is MBps or Mbps and if Verizon 20/20 FIOS is really faster than Comcast 100Mbps?</p>
