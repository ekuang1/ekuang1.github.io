message: <p>The offer sounds good but not without a guarantee of some level of bandwidth.  <br><br><br><br>Phil, remember all those network bandwidth problems we've been dealing with for *months*...  Well... take a guess at who the provider *was*.  <br><br><br><br>Sharp as a Marble says it all -- "they cut my cable while they were doing it."  They sure do know how to get the job done!<br><br><br><br>Months of promised bandwidth and all they could deliver was a broadband connection with download speeds less that a 56K modem.  *No one* within their organization could find the root of the problem.  They couldn't explain it and they couldn't fix it.<br><br><br><br>In short... do your homework before you pay Verizon $50 a month for internet service.  In the end you might find that it would be worth paying them $50 a month not to give you the worst customer service you'll ever experience.</p>
