message: <p>I have it worse than you. Several of my friends at work who live a scant 10 miles from me have it. One of them sends me screenshots on ocassion (he's actually hit 17Mbps).<br><br><br><br>Verizon laid the FO cable in my neighborhood a year ago. I remember it well because they cut my cable while they were doing it. However, that's all they did. They didn't hook it up nor do they have any idea when they will.<br><br><br><br>Now I know how King Tantillus felt.</p>
