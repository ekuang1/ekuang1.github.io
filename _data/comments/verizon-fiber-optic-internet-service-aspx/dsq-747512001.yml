message: <p>I have been interested in FiOS for a long time, and have heard that in some places its dirt cheap (read $20/mo. w/ limited download size).  All I want to know is if it is offered here in Nebraska and which cities (Lincoln and Omaha are obvious places so dont include them), who offers it, and how much it costs.</p>
