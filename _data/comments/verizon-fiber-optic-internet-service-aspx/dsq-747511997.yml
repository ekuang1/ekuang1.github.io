message: <p>YAHOO!!!, go onto a site I like to call "Google" and look it up.  It's not that hard.  Simply type in "fiber optic internet", and viola!  There are 23,400 pages waiting to tell you how it works, and why it doesn't need a phone line to work.  Also, it's spelled please.  The rest of your post was almost perfect in grammar, and you ruined it with "plz".  Also read the posts above yours, there is a link to the Verizon site for FiOS.  Please learn how to use the internet, rather than asking the same questions over and over again like a parrot.<br> - Rich</p>
