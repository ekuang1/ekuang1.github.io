message: <p>I have Verizon FIOS and I really like it (had it for about 1 and 1/2 months now).  Probably the only thing I do not like about the FIOS service, is that Verizon  makes you sign up for a two year agreement to get the discount on your telephone service and internet bundle.  Also they do not guarantee that any of you additional computers that you have a wireless connection going to the FIOS will perform at the same rate of speed as the initial computer. - and it doesn't, it is slower, sometimes very slow. I previously had Verizon DSL and felt it was quite slow.  <br>Regarding Verizon customer service, I have had Verizon since they took over GTE way back when for my telephone service and I have had Verizon Wireless since they took over Airtouch.  I find there customer service to be very good.</p>
