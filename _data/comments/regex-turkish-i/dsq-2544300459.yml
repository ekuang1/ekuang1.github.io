message: <p>As mentioned below, the real solution is to not rely on `[a-zA-Z]` but to use character classes that encompass entire ranges of unicode character sets. `\w` is a much more reliable test since it matches any valid word character in any language. Even in Perl, you should turn on Unicode rules, but even without it, you can use `\p{Word}`.</p>
