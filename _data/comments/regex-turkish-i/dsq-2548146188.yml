message: <p>The documentation itself is incomplete.  It states "The lowercase equivalent of c, modified according to culture, or the unchanged value of c, if c is already lowercase or not alphabetic."</p><p>That last phrase "if c is already lowercase or not alphabetic" should be qualified, with either one of the following:<br>  - "... lowercase or not alphabetic in the target culture"<br>  - "... lowercase or not alphabetic according to Unicode standards"</p><p>I also don't fully get what "modified according to culture" means.  Would the other direction char.ToUpper('i', new CultureInfo("tr-TR")) be 'I' or 'Ä°"?</p>
