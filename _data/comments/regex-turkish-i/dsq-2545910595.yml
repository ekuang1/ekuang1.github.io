message: <p>&gt; Ah, I understand. You're saying it should be Invariant because people who have been slinging Regex for a long time would expect it to do so, rather than sticking to the global .NET convention everything else uses CurrentCulture (such as ToLower() and StartsWith()). Seems like Regex should take in a CultureInfo as an overload, just like those methods do instead of that silly enum flag.</p><p>Yes! Exactly. It "sort of" follows the convention of strings, but regex is a different beast with a long history and idioms of its own.</p><p>I mean, what I'd really love is a regex literal in C#, but not sure if that will ever happen. :)</p>
