message: <p>Wow, you aren't kidding when you say the site is still in Beta. I would even say Alpha at this point. All the links at the bottom seem to be broken, I can't login after registering, there is no confirmation when registering, and it says "Orchard Gallery" a couple of places. Otherwise it looks great.<br>Anything I can do to help make the site better?</p>
