message: <p>Don't piss me off. I look forward to the sonic boom of reentry and get a little cranky when they take it away from me.<br><br><br><br>True story. A few years back I was sleeping at night as I am occasionally wont to do when someone driving an 18-wheeler full of cement hit my house at 120 MPH. At least that's what it sounded like. It was the TAIL boom from the shuttle (the original one had been the reason I was awake, I just didn't know it at the time).<br><br><br><br>Until you've had something the size of a large 3 story house break the sound barrier, you've just not lived life. And I was a Marine working on F/A-18's and Marine pilots aren't known for their strict adherence to rules.</p>
