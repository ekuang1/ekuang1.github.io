message: <p>I grabbed MvcTurbine and Windsor - and it was fine, except MvcTurbine uses a prior version of the Windsor included.<br>Anything to be done for this - because these types of mismatches are the real problem with OSS imo - not the delivery system (although a delivery system is nice to have).<br></p>
