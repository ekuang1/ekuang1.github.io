message: <p>Congrats on the NuPack and MVC Releases. In your "guiding principles" I found "works against your source code" to be confusing. You probably want "works with your source code" or "on" or any number of other words. I first read that as "works antagonistically with your source code" ...<br>Then again, I never was too bright.</p>
