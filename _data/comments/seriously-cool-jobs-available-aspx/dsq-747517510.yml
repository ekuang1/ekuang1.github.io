message: <p>There are certain features that I would like to add to SubText but how are these prioritized?  They aren't on the Road Map.<br>Some simple things I was thinking were:<br>Allow a email to be sent to a user when someone responds to your comment in any blog. For example, if you respond to my post it'll send me an email.  Right now I'll have to come back and re-check this "post".  Since I can't remember what just happend 5 minutes ago, I have little chance of seeing a response.<br>Allow a file to be attached to a blog posting.  Mainly to attach code, or word doc, or whatever.  I've been wanting to share some components I've built in an easy way.<br>Integrate (maybe just cross-post) with YetAnotherForums.Net (another OSS that I contrib to) to allow people to post a forum/blog post.<br>Create a package that allows a user to install blog, image browser, or forum - all with the same membership authentication.</p>
