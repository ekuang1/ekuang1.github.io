message: <p>@Asbj√∏rn Browsers have a history of caching problems, bugs, etc... As Zihotki says, that would be relying on every browser from now and into the future to get this correct. Not only every browser, but every Proxy server.<br>I'm not willing to lay my bet on that.<br>One nice thing about requiring POST is that it protects ALL browsers, old and new. Only an untrusted browser would be prone to this issue, but if your browser is compromised, then all bets are off anyways. It might as well send keystrokes directly to the bad guy. ;)<br>I also <a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2009/06/26/too-late-to-change-json.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Too late to change JSON?">wrote about an alternative</a> which would require everyone to change JSON itself. I have very little hope of seeing it happen, but it also has the benefit of suddenly closing the hole for old browsers.</p>
