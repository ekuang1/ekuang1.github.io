message: <p>Hi Phil! I've been using DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie (ClaimsIdentity) to sign in my website. In the past, I used to use Session, but we knows the problem handling it. Do you think that using authentication with cookies, could be a problem and put my website in risk when using JSON?</p><p>Best Regards,<br>Dan</p>
