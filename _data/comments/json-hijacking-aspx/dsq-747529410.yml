message: "<p>Very nice article and good debate,<br>Let me amuse you with more extreme thoughts (than using Post)...<br>I think for for whatever it's worth , we should not use browsers at all and use specific containers for the business applications so that all vulnerabilities, hacks associated with browsers are dealt in single shot.<br>Comparing this to a real-life scenario..when one withdraw big money from ATM/bank, then he/she prefers to travel in private vehicle rather than a shared/public transport. I am sure readers in US will not associate much with this. However, readers in India probably will. IMO, web security scenario is same in US &amp; India w.r.t. # and type of vulnerabilities.<br>With above being said, I think browsers will still make a good choice for informational websites (such as news) as well as a good vehicle to distribute business applications...<br>Now whatever I have said above is only for new applications, changing existing applications to new containers will require tremendous amount of effort so will not advise for it...<br> <br></p>"
