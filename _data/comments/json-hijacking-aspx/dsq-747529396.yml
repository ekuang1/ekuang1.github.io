message: <p>Phil,<br>1. Thanks for this post.<br>2. Thanks for the descriptive error in ASP.NET MVC 2.  I wouldn't have known about this if it weren't for that exception.  In general, I appreciate the attitude that "we should make them stop and think" but then also allow me to go ahead anyway via simple annotation.<br>3. I wonder how impossible it would be to take the next logical step and include a link to a MS KB article in the server's response?</p>
