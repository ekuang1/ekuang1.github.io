message: '<p>Thank you, Haacked, very important notes about jSon. But we will never found now sites where javascript not used. Controls from ASP.NET in big cases also use javascript libraries for generating events from client side. You are right that ASP.NET has better security and more reliable then MVC, but i must note that sometime error (mistake) of security is into wrong adjusting of web servers. Image next: if somebody has <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> site into root site with just only asp technology - then not any grantee that asp code easy to use to hijack strong security from <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a>(note: it will works like inserted by json javascripts but more worst - on server side). <br>My resume: problem not with technology of sending objects - problem how and where it must be used. JSON is good for news feed and for chat objects. JSON is bad for transmitting in banking, servicing and accounting systems where databases save a lot of records about providers and subscribers. <br>But i hope your article will help a lot of CEO find a right way for the web technology and do not a lot of changing every year regards of modern words in press. step by step we need use reliable technology and with maximal profit and faster and faster experiment with new ideas around.<br>Sincerely, LukCAD</p>'
