message: <p>Hi,<br>I'm currently busy with a RIA develoment.<br>I came to this post as I wanted to make sure that I don't have any security problems.<br>I'm currently bound to use MVC2 and VS2008 (damned employers...)<br>So, according to the inforamtion in this post and in the alternative proposal, I'm actually safe and this from the first time I took on hijaxing the forms...<br>This is merely due to a post (sorry, I don't remember which one and who is to grant for that) that was somehow questioning how to get json object returned with specific "attributes" or call the m properties...<br>So this would leave the possibility to include the actual result(data), a message and a status.<br>I was looking into some sort of same functionality in order to be able to perform client-side validation plus server-side validation and take appropriate actions depending on the validation results...<br>SO it finally sort out that currently the application repsonses will look all similar to this :<br>return Json(new<br>                        {<br>                            status = 0,<br>                            message = "You are Authenticated",<br>                            data = RedirectUrl<br>                        });<br>And as far as I understood the problem here, this response "template" is not opening the door to the bad guy.<br></p>
