  Nowadays I use a lot of mixture of static web sites + some functionalities provided by Azure Functions. One of the easiest to setup that I found are Cloudflare Workers which can do both, https and a bit of compute (serverless). Then, for real active parts I use Azure Functions. This mixture proved itself several times. Have you ever tried this blend?
