message: <p>Thanks, Phil.</p><p>For some reason, Disqus didn't notify me of your response and so I was looking at what others had done.</p><p>I did find some good posts and the consensus was to use Git for Windows because it supported 64bit PowerShell and all Modules available in the ISE. See Mike Robbins' post about it:<br><a href="http://mikefrobbins.com/2016/02/09/configuring-the-powershell-ise-for-use-with-git-and-github/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mikefrobbins.com/2016/02/09/configuring-the-powershell-ise-for-use-with-git-and-github/">http://mikefrobbins.com/201...</a></p><p>So, in answer to my questions 1 and 2 it seems that for those who wish to use PowerShell ISE with Modules the best method is to install both.</p><p>However, it seems like the two environments are quite separate and that any authentication method established by GitHub Desktop is not used by Git for Windows.</p><p>I guess that this was why I asked about intention to combine the two. A single installation that provided a full GitHub for Desktop and full Git for Windows experience would (obviously) be ideal. Especially, if that installer made it easy to manage Git setup across all of your PowerShell Hosts (powershell.exe, powershell_ise.exe).</p><p>In a later update to the article, Mike also recommends using https:// instead of SSH, at least on Windows - which is also what GitHub recommends:<br><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git">https://help.github.com/art...</a></p><p>Thanks for reminding me to RTFB regarding point 3. Actually, it makes sense now that I've been trying to figure out a way to make the PowerShell environment portable on OneDrive.</p><p>Regarding point 4, I don't think OneDrive is susceptible to any network latency, because apps write to a local directory at full speed. OneDrive handles replication to the cloud behind the scene.</p><p>Cheers. Thanks again, Phil.</p>
