message: <p>Hi Phil, thanks for a great article.</p><p>A few questions:<br>1. If we want to use the latest Git version with Powershell ISE do we need to install Git for Windows?<br>2. Is the intention there for GitHub Desktop to replace the Git for Windows installer and become the sole provider of a full Git experience in the command line?<br>3. Is it possible to just have GitHub Desktop installed and configure Powershell ISE to execute all Git commands without needing to use the Git Shell shortcut? This could provide a seamless experience, aka bash.<br>4. I want to keep my Git environment completely on cloud storage (OneDrive, etc), including GitHub Desktop (as well as Git for Windows) and all Git repositories. Is this possible? I'll also be configuring all Powershell modules and profiles to run from there, including all code editor configs.</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 and pretty much use Powershell ISE exclusively (are DevOps interested in using the regular powersell.exe environment, much - really?).</p><p>Cheers, nick.</p>
