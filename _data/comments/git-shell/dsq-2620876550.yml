message: <p>&gt; 1. If we want to use the latest Git version with Powershell ISE do we need to install Git for Windows?</p><p>GitHub for Windows should work. If you need the absolute latest Git the day it comes out, then you can install Git for Windows.</p><p>&gt; 2. Is the intention there for GitHub Desktop to replace the Git for Windows installer and become the sole provider of a full Git experience in the command line?</p><p>For those that like the experience we provide, yes because we automatically upgrade Git for you and provide a nice experience. Also keep in mind that we're packaging the same code as Git for Windows in a portable manner. So it's the same Git.</p><p>&gt; 3. Is it possible to just have GitHub Desktop installed and configure Powershell ISE to execute all Git commands without needing to use the Git Shell shortcut? This could provide a seamless experience, aka bash.</p><p>Yeah. Just set up your PowerShell profile to load shell.ps1 per the instructions in this article.</p><p>&gt; 4. I want to keep my Git environment completely on cloud storage (OneDrive, etc), including GitHub Desktop (as well as Git for Windows) and all Git repositories. Is this possible? I'll also be configuring all Powershell modules and profiles to run from there, including all code editor configs.</p><p>This is not a supported option at the moment. It might work if you map a drive letter to your OneDrive, but network issues using Git for Windows and GitHub Desktop against a "local drive" that is actually a flaky network could cause problems. </p>
