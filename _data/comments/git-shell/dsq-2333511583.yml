message: <p>I've been using ConEmu recently and really like it. It includes tabbed navigation, ability to launch cmd, powershell and bash (and more if you want!) and is incredibly customizable. You should check it out if you haven't tried it yet!</p><p><a href="https://conemu.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://conemu.github.io/">https://conemu.github.io/</a></p>
