message: <p>&gt; We keep everything updated so you don't have to.</p><p>Everything except Git, it seems ;). GitHub Desktop still installs Git 1.9.5 (a custom build, it seems), even though Git for WIndows 2.6.2 is available. Why is that?</p><p>Regarding ConsoleZ, I'm not really convinced of the benefits if you're using Windows 10. The default console host has been greatly improved in WIndows 10, and now supports resizing, Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V for copy/paste, keyboard selection, transparency, etc</p>
