message: <p>Why bother thinking up your own topic when you can just leave a comment on someone elses blog.  <br><br><br><br>Seriously, half the fun of having a blog is the lack of pressure on having to make that next post.  Regular readers read it via RSS subscriptions, so if you don't have any inspiration for 6 months, its ok because people only delete RSS subscriptions based on taste, not lack of recent entries.</p>
