message: <p>"Terror is the tactics of cowards, fighting for freedom in the world is right and just and takes courage"<br><br><br><br>If this is freedom, you can have it.<br><br>In February of 2003 there were 411 people killed by terrorist activities in Iraq - and the numbers since they have been "freed"? In May 2004 there were over 1,200 innocent casualties in that country.<br><br>These were not soldiers - these were people going to work or walking their dogs.<br><br><br><br>Apparently freedom tastes like blood.<br><br><br><br>I am so glad that the US has decided that Canada doesn't need "freedom".<br><br>I am tired of listening to the diehard "patriots" in your country trashing one of the only men in the US who actually takes your Constitution to heart. Freedom of Speech is not just a paragraph on a musty piece of paper, Freedom of Speech is a right and a duty. Apparently Moore is one of the only filmakers in the US that takes his duty seriously.<br><br><br><br>Honestly, I think that Moore has the right to his opinion. He has the right to broadcast that opinion over the airwaves 24/7. You have the right to ignore him. <br><br><br><br>You have the right to say to yourself "That's what Micheal Moore believes, but I don't think the same way." It doesn't warrant an all out attack on his beliefs or his opinions. Unlike the US government's opinions about Iraq - his views aren't occupying your cities and waving a gun in your face as they try to "free" you<br><br><br><br>And really people, its a documentary - not a bomb.<br><br>Most people will come out of that movie and not have their views changed one bit.<br><br>I know mine won't.</p>
