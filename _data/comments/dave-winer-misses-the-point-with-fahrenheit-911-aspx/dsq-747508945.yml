message: <p>"And really people, its a documentary - not a bomb. "<br><br><br><br>There is a difference between a documentary and leftist propoganda just as there is a difference between the truth an opinion.<br><br><br><br>MM is a sad, angry man who has found his voice through a camera.  He generates high-voltage opinions, so does Rush, Teddy Kennedy, Dennis Miller, Ann Colter, Alan Colmbs, etc.  All of these people attempt to distill truth and opinion to sound bites and clever reparte.   <br><br><br><br>The real truth is that there is a ideological struggle going on and blood is being shed.  Which side are you on - the side of cowardly terrorist ( the poor, oppressed victims, freedom fighters, holy jihadists) or the side of freedom (imperialsts, opressors, conservativies, capitalists)?  Pick your lables!<br><br><br><br>Remember however, there is a basic philosophy behind each side and you MUST choose.  Is it a clean choice - no, nothing ever is but the philiosphy is clear and the decision is not hard.<br><br><br><br>If you understand this below, the chioce is automatic.<br><br><a href="http://compuball.com/Inquisition/Galt/galtspeech.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://compuball.com/Inquisition/Galt/galtspeech.htm">http://compuball.com/Inquisition/Galt/galtspeech.htm</a><br><br></p>
