message: <p>Germany attacked the United States in WW2?  No, but Imperial Japan did... and Japan was in cahoots with Germany.<br><br><br><br>One enemy in cahoots with another sounds familiar.<br><br><br><br>A person living in a free and democratic society who attacks its leader is not courageous.  Try doing that in China, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, etc.  That would be courage.</p>
