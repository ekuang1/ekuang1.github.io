message: <p>"A person living in a free and democratic society who attacks its leader is not courageous. Try doing that in China, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, etc. That would be courage."<br><br><br><br>Erm, so you're saying that fear of death is the only legitimate fear, so unless a person lives in a totalitarian dictatorship, they have no right criticise the leader, because it's too *safe*, rendering outspokenness *cowardly*?<br><br><br><br>Wow.<br><br><br><br>I guess we can now add 'criticism is cowardice' to other famous sayings, such as 'ignorance is strength' and 'freedom is slavery'.</p>
