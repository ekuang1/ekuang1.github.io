message: <p>Dave Winer making judgements on a movie based upon the clips released for publicity... is rather like making judgements on the war itself based upon the scraps of edited intelligence released by the White House.<br><br><br><br>Someone should ask Dave whether he'd like to be judged by someone based upon selected clips of his site.</p>
