message: <p>Dave is usually pretty sanctimonios about this stuff. I don't pay much attention to his ideas of intellectual, ethical or moral purity. He's rarely all the way wrong about politics and culture but usually misses the point. I like his technology though.<br><br><br><br>I thought the congressional kids in Iraq part was especially interesting when viewed in relation to that Lilenfeld (sp?) lady, the one whose kid was killed in Iraq.<br><br><br><br>It is true that neither Congress people nor George Bush is able to command their child to military service. However, if they weren't hypocrits, they might have brought their children up to resemble those of Ms Lilenfeld.<br><br><br><br>She says that she taught them from an early age that military service was a valuable and important occupation. When they grew up, they were proud to enter the service.<br><br><br><br>I am betting that Bush's daughters did not get that message. I'll bet few Congress people's children did either.<br><br><br><br>The point is that these people are making decisions and taking viewpoints that they only believe in application to others. Michael Moore's guerilla theater dramatizes this fact.<br><br><br><br>One other thing.<br><br><br><br>F 9/11 is a work of art. Like Picasso's Guernica, it doesn't have to show literal truth to be useful. It needs to communicate a viewpoint that resonates with people and their understanding of reality. Although I believe that the facts of the bin Laden family connections to Bush are accurate, whether or not Bush himself is their servant need not be true to make the completely valid point that Bush has a lot of weird skeletons in his closet, has friends whose influence should worry us, and that there is plenty of reason to think he is corrupt. <br><br><br><br>The artistic viewpoint is that war is bad, the Iraq war is bad and hypocrits that are friends with the bin Laden family are worrisome. These are real, emotional truths that Moore has found a way to illustrate. Disagree if you want. Call him an artist, not a treasoner. He has brutally criticized George Bush. In America, the phrase "Etat, C'est Moi," doesn't apply.</p>
