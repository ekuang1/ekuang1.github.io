message: <p>We went to war in WWI and WWII because citizens were being killed just for visiting Europe.  We did not go into the WWII for high moral reasons.  In fact, the president at the time was an antisemite.  As with then, only now do we acknowledge the higher moral purpose (both WWII and Iraq).  Our war in Iraq was based on a number of things, the primary being that Cheney wanted it since he was ousted back during Sr.'s reign.<br><br><br><br>How about having the Right show a little restraint and ability to listen to the other side?  God knows, the Left has had endure it for four years.</p>
