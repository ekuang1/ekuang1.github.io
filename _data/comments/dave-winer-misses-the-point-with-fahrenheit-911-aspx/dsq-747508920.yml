message: "<p>Regarding the comment by Mr. Cheese: Those are rather strong statements.  Treasonous sociopath? C'mon.  Moore is many things but certainly not 'One who is affected with a personality disorder marked by antisocial behavior' as the dictionary definition states. He's a film maker with a definite opinion for sure.  He also supports an opponant of the incumbant president in an upcoming election.  I certainly don't think he has committed treason by any stretch.  That's what makes this country great - you can say whatever you want about whomever you want and they WON'T throw you in jail.  That's a feature, not a bug.<br><br><br><br>I just find it interesting how republicans are so quick to put negatively connotative lables on people just because they do not believe in the same things you or your political party do.  Sociopath, indeed.  If that's the case, it looks like you're living in a big glass house my friend.<br><br><br><br>The world is not all black and white - there's a lot of grey mixed in. And no matter how much you pour bleech on all that you do not like, you're never going to turn everything white.  Diversity is what drives this country and makes it successful; accept it.<br><br><br><br>Thomas Jefferson said it best:  \"Dissent is the highest form of Patriotism.\"  Republican was he, I might add. Of course things were a lot different then, I suppose.</p>"
