message: <p>&gt; Iraq did not attack us, Al Queda did.<br><br><br><br>Pearl Harbor had a return address. 9/11 didn't. I live in a country that has experienced "jehadi" terrorism first-hand for 20 years, and I know that these guys don't respect the nation-state. They use the advantages nation-states confer (freedom from extradition, etc) in order to subvert them.<br><br><br><br>&gt; Where is the tie to Al Queda?<br><br><br><br>Funnily enough, Putin warned the US about possible Iraqi terror attacks right around the time Farenheit 9/11 got onto the media radar.  The ultimate irony is that if it had actually carried some out, the same people who are criticising the Iraq war today would have accused the administration of "not doing anything". IMO preemption as a doctrine is painful but it works. Today (based on feedback from friends in the middle-east) the Arabs are scrared sh*tless of America (and despising it too). Sure, it's nice to be loved, but even nicer not to be taken as a wuss and bombed around because someone thinks you're the great satan.<br><br><br><br>On another note, I don't know why Saddam and his regime gathered so much sympathy. Do you really think life for most Iraqis was a bed of roses under that man? Compared to some of the crap the US has done (Vietnam, Nicaragua) this was positively *easy* to support.<br><br></p>
