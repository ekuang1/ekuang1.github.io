message: "<p>F9/11 is pure propaganda.  Sometimes the way to get people to take notice and ask questions is to pose your own questions in an utterly ridiculous manner.<br><br><br><br>MM is to the Loony Left what Rush Limbaugh is to the Wacko Right.  Those who take MM seriously are as guilty of sheep-like mentality as those who take Rush so.  America is in the middle of these two polars, and most, without the benefit of megaphone-mouths, are bemused by how much noise and energy is wasted by the two and their followers.<br><br><br><br>For Gabs, the Canadian: Yes, MM has the right to his opinion.  Yes, others are free to tune out.  But, others are also free to criticize him in as loud a voice as he uses to broadcast his own messages.  Yes, some are a little shrill but that's probably due to the fact that they don't have the multi-million dollar platform that he has.<br><br><br><br></p>"
