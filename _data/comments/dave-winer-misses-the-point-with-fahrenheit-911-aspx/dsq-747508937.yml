message: <p>Absolutely Akahige! I totally agree with everything you just said! Everyone can tell MM to F**K off for all I care. They can point out every little inconsistancy and half-truth in his movie all they want and broadcast it to the world. And MM is definitely the loony left.<br><br><br><br>But its when they have the audacity to call his opinions wrong that really gets me. Its an opinion - by definition it cannot be wrong. That's like calling Christianity incorrect - it may not be what you believe in but it certainly is not wrong.<br><br>(just an example, not trying to start a religious discussion)<br><br><br><br>If that was how the government was run it would be akin to a political Jihad - you're wrong and I'm right and I'm going to censor/kill/imprison you for it and in my opinion that is an awful thing to think of.<br><br><br><br>I don't agree with him, 'but I will fight to the death to defend his right to say it'<br><br><br><br>And thats what freedom is all about.</p>
