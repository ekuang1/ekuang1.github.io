message: "<p>Although I frequently disagree with Mr. Winer, he is right on target in his critique of Michael Moore.  Gabs - you are wrong when you say \"it's a documentary.\"  The movie is clearly propaganda, not a documentary; look up the meanings of the words in a dictionary if you don't believe me.  No less than NBC News and The New York Times have documented the falsehoods and manipulative editing techniques Moore uses to make his point.<br><br><br><br>In fact, the premise from which this whole discussion sprang (i.e. \"sending\" my kids to war) is absurd: as if I'd say to my 18 year-old son \"Well, junior, it's been a great 18 years, but I'm sending you off to the war now.  Remember to duck.\"  There is no draft; young men and women volunteer to serve because they want to.</p>"
