message: '<p>Hello guys. I have a site that drives me crazy. I want to make a post in there from a WinApp in C# but everytime I tried, had no luck. <br>The website is:  <a href="http://patrick.net/housing/news.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://patrick.net/housing/news.php">http://patrick.net/housing/...</a> but you can see that it redirects you at <a href="http://patrick.net/housing/login.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://patrick.net/housing/login.php">http://patrick.net/housing/...</a> which requires an email and a password first. <br>When you try a request with ie browser is something like this:  email=xcrysoft@hotmail.com&amp;pw=xxxxx&amp;submit=Log+In  Everytime I post with my app I receive as response the same login.php and no news.php that I want. This are the header from the request from my app: <br>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)<br>Cache-Control: no-cache<br>Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate<br>Content-Length: 59<br>Connection: Keep-Alive<br>Host: <a href="http://patrick.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="patrick.net">patrick.net</a><br>So, I managed to get rid of the 100-continue thing thanks to this thread... but still have this problem. Can anybody help me? PLEASE!!! I can tell you in details if someone wants to help me</p>'
