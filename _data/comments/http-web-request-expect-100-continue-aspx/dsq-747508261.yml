message: <p>Very nice describtion, anyways, I've set the property (Expect100Continue) to false and I'm still getting the time out exception...<br>Could this be just because of the connection? I mean, that a simple time out occures due to the slow connection?<br>Increasing the time out property seems to help...<br>Any ideas?</p>
