message: <p>i just spent a whole day trying to figure out the problem with my code. after firing up wireshark and sniffing the calls, comparing them with the same requests made in python successfully, i found out about this stupid expect header value. after googling the words "httpwebrequest expect continue", i found this blog post. thank you for sharing your rant, you saved my work.</p>
