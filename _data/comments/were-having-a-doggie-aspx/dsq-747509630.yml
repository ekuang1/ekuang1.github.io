message: <p>I was going to suggest the same thing. Italian Greyhounds seem to be very high-strung, nervous things. <br><br><br><br>We had a whippet that we got as a puppy and kept until he died of old age. We got him from a kennel at the age of almost a year. He was extremely neurotic in a more or less calm sort of way. Once I stepped on his foot by mistake and he stopped eating and gave me dirty looks for about a week.<br><br><br><br>He could run a lot faster than all the other dogs until he started developing arthritis, but he would deliberately hold back so as not to embarass them. He also could jump over tall fences without any particular effort. <br><br><br><br>He was useless as a guard dog since he didn't know how to bark and was very friendly to all.<br><br><br><br>He tolerated living in Philadelphia and only going out twice a day on a leash, but he was much happier when we moved to central Long Isalnd and he could roam around.<br><br><br><br>Regards from Darel and Patrick.<br><br><br><br></p>
