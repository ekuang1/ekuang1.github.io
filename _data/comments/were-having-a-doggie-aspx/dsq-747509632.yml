message: <p>My sister adopted a Greyhound from a blood bank.  Apparently, after they finish their racing careers, some go off to be blood donors.  Greyhounds, so I'm told, are universal (dog) blood donors.  Anyway, if you get them from the blood bank, it pretty much guarantees that they'll be healthy.<br><br><br><br>Other things I though I would mention:<br><br>- Her dog shed a lot.<br><br>- Her dog was given back because of a nasty disposition. (may not be common)<br><br>- Her dog ran fast, then sat around in the house.<br><br>- It was a nice dog, but it attacked Dubya (my dog) once, so...</p>
