message: <p>He was originally a member of Take That, probably the biggest boy band the UK has ever seen.<br>They had numerous number 1 hits all over the world before they split and he went solo.<br>He is a massive football fan, I think he supports Port Vale, which is a League 1 side over here.<br>I must admit I'm not a fan but whatever floats your boat.</p>
