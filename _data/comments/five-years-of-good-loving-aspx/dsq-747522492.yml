message: <p>My wife and I got married twice in the same week :D<br>Our wedding plans weren't turning out the way we wanted (both of our mothers had different ideas than we did about our how our wedding should be), so we went to Vegas and got married a week before our actual ceremony.  Our parents were slightly miffed... but they got to have the ceremony the way they wanted, and we got to have our small, quick civil ceremony the way we wanted.</p>
