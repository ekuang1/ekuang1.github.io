message: <p>@keyvan Well there was an across the board tightening up for security  reasons, though many measures were simply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Security Theater on Wikipedia">security theater</a>.<br>The real problem was the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service which is now rolled into Homeland Security) employees. I'm not saying all INS employees are bad, just every one we ever dealt with. Petty disgusting people, and you have to understand me, I pretty much never talk bad about anyone. Ask <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Rob Conery's Blog">Rob Conery</a>, I have a lot of patience. ;)<br>But the power these people have over immigrants, many who were immigrants themselves at one time, really inflates their head and creates one long power trip. My wife told me stories about how awful they were to her, but I didn't really understand until I had to go into the INS offices with her after we got married and experienced it first hand.<br>That's why I was glad to read in the papers about a new immigration office they are building in the U.S. I think it was Florida. They are trying to put a human touch back to what made America great in the first place.</p>
