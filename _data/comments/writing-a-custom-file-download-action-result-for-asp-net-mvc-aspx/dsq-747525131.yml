message: <p>I haven't downloaded these bits yet, I'm using preview 2.<br>So I wonder - how is this 'return ActionResult' going to effect things where in several instances I use a response.write from an ajax call, or where I create an excel spreadsheet and push it back to the client with response.end, etc...<br>Will I have to write a unique actionresult for each of these?<br></p>
