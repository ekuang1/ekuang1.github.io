message: <p>Does anyone know how to use httpcontext.response.transmitfile or any other httpcontext function to download a file from a network driver instead of local driver? When I tried to use context.Response.TransmitFile(DownloadPath) to download files, the DownloadPath has to be local driver. If it's a network driver, the download failed. Thanks in advance...</p>
