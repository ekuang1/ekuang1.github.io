message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I know it is typical to write a different public controller method for each view you want to render. I have noticed you have hard coded the the DownloadResult properties in your ActionResult method and i have been wondering ... do i have to write a separate render method to handle lets say two file download links on my page using your approach?</p>
