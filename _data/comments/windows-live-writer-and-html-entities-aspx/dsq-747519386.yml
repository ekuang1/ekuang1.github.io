message: <p>Am I right in thinking you're expecting HTML entities/encoding to be stored in your database instead of the UTF8 characters?<br>If so, that seems fundamentally wrong to me - mixing up the current presentation markup with the real content.  What if you want to serve it up somewhere else in the future that doesn't use HTML/these entities?<br>[)amien</p>
