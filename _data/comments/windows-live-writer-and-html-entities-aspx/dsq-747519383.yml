message: <p>thanks Joe. Yes, the mucking with my HTML is the problem. <br>The other problem was when I cut and paste the XML-RPC being sent back and forth into a file, named that file with a .xml extension, and then opened it with IE, it gave me an error with those characters.<br>So I started worrying the category thing was an encoding issue. But as you posted in my other post, it appears to just be a not-yet implemented "feature" of WLW. :)<br>Thanks!</p>
