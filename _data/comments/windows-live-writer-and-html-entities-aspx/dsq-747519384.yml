message: <p>While fresh in my mind, you've found a wonderful example of system incoherence and its consequences.  There's a whole change of potential transformation points in the path between you and the browser view of the blog post (or the comment form and the blog post view), and back again (from some intermediate point) for re-editing of the material.  <br>It is easy to introduce transformations in the wrong places, and it is easy to repair them in more wrong places.  This has happened in the bumpy evolution of e-mail and it is now happening here.</p>
