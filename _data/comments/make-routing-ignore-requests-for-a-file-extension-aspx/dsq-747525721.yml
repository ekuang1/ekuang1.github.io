message: <p>@Steve What Sean said is exactly correct.  The route URL in the ignor routes happen to be "catch-all" routes, meaning they match everything. They are not regexes.<br>The part *after* the route URL is the Constraints dictionary used to constrain what URLs the route will match. That part does use regex by default for fine grained control over matching.</p>
