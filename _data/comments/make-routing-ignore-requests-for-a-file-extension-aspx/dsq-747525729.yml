message: <p>Maybe it's just me but I am finding the usage of all these anonymous type parameters in the MVC framework really resistant to exploration and understanding.  To me they are non obvious and not self explanatory.<br>On another note . . . is there going to be a pure regex route handler pushed out by the MVC team?  Many people who are very accustomed to using regexes would greatly prefer them over the tokenized routes.  Well at least I know I would :)</p>
