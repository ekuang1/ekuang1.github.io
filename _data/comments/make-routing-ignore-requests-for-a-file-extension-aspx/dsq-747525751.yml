message: <p>how do we give link for a web-form(report) in a mvc2 page as link; which is located in folder called Reports in Views folder. when i try to give a link for that page in Report, I finding it hard since the request is by default going to the controller. I tried to use href and actionlink but i guess I am missing something.</p>
