message: "<p>After looking into this further. It seems like the behavior of all files being managed is expected, and due to the runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=\"true\" setting in web.config.  While the UrlRoutingModule might do nothing once it figures out the request is a static file, it's still problematic to have all static files be managed.  Here's a specific troublesome example: Forms auth with a redirect to a login page - all static files requested by said login page will be redirected as well.  That's right, the css file and images used by the login page will themselves be redirected to the login page, making for a very crappy looking login page.  How can we work around this?  The only solution I've found is to make certain that your static content is in a folder/app that is not managed by .NET.  That means all static files go in a separate website, or by creating an app within your web app that uses a different AppPool.  Is there a better solution for this?  It doesn't seem like it would be too hard to never send static files through the .NET runtime to begin with.  Perhaps a little more granularity than runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=\"true\".</p>"
