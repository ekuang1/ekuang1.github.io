message: <p>I can't do any of that. I used to be able to copy files from remote computer to my old computer (Windows 7 Professional). On the new computer (running Windows 7 premium) I have been unable to copy or to drop and past the files i need from the remote computer.<br>Just wondering if the operating system might have something to do or if i needed to set up something else on the Remote computer<br>Thank you</p>
