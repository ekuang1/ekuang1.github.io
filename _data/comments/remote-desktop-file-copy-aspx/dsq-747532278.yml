message: <p>One thing with remote desktop sessions that leaves me completely gobsmacked is how the heck do I disable my local PC speaker from beeping! It is terrible! Sometimes I remote in late i.e. when the wife is sleeping and when I'm laying in bed and all of a sudden a huge loud PC speaker beep emanates from my laptop, which kind of disturbs her. I have never been able to figure out how to suppress my local PC speaker from making it's obligatory beep!</p>
