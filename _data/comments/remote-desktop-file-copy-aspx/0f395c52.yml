message: The easiest way to transfer files from one cloud storage to another is to use "FTP Manager Pro". It also allows file transfer between PC folders, FTP servers, Android mobile devices and more. There are many excellent features such as automatic resume, transfer modes, SFTP and FTPS support etc. It has really helped me a lot.https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ftp-manager-pro/9n9sr72c98cm?activetab=pivot:overviewtab
