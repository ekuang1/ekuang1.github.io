message: <p>Can't remember when I first did that it's so long ago, probably in the 90's. <br>Since drag and drop is a core functionality of the GUI environment (ever heard of the Xerox Star system released in 1982?) I assume any semi-sophisticated application makes use of it. It's the first thing I try when trying to move something from A to B. It's only when that fails that I begin looking at the alternatives.<br>You'd be amazed at some of the objects that can be dragged from one environment into another. Try it sometime.</p>
