message: <p>Great feature, but retarded slow.  Even more slow if you're RDP'ing over an encrypted connection (e.g. you're on  VPN that's encrypted, and then the RDP is encrypted on top of that).  At that point, it's almost faster for me to drive to the office, throw a thumb drive in, get the files, then drive home than it is to wait for them to finish (granted, I'm talking about large files).<br>Either way, it works and it's easy to use.  MS doesn't do a good job of advertising it's features.  I mean, they've had *great* voice recognition since XP and built into Windows since Vista.  Mac comes out with it and everyone's like OMG, that's so innovative, you can talk to it and it does stuff.  When I broke my arm that feature saved me, yet, you don't ever hear about them touting features like that.  MS has one of the worst marketing teams in existence (like, remember the bomb that was the Jerry Seinfeld commercials where they spent like 100 million dollars and people were burnt out on the commercials before they were even released).  I mean, they over advertised the advertisement like it was something revolutionary.</p>
