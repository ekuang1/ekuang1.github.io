message: <p>While I knew about the local resources option I never expose my local disks to a machine I'm remote-desktopped into. There's too much of a security risk as usually the reason I'm even connected to someone's machines is because there's a problem with it and that problem may well be caused by a virus.<br>I'd love to be able to just copy/paste a single file. It's happened thousands of times that I'll need to move one file, usually a text file at that to or from a machine I'm remote-desktopped to. Dealing with this is nearly always a time-wasting adventure.</p>
