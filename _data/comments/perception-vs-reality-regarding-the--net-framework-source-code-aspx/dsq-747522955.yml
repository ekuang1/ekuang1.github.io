message: <p>But that's the thing - legal and PR don't set policy.  The policy is set, primarily, by the business groups who take very seriously the advise and assistance of legal and PR, but at the end of the day, they make the call.  In this case, the conception, planning, design, and execution of the plan was purely focused on helping .NET developers be more successful - of that I can vow.  Realize that this wasn't driven or mandated in any way by management or legal or anywhere else, it was really my little mission (with Scott's support) that I've been cultivating for almost three years now.  So, hey, however other people see it isn't something I can every be 100% sure of, but I do know the context and content of every single meeting and email about this over the last 12 months, and there weren't any pinky masterplans involved.<br>I'll stop kvetching now.  At the end of the day, I can't prove a negative, which is what much of this stuff boils down to.  Phil's post here nails most of the points I'd ever try to make, plus he's funny and stuff.<br>Alright, I'd better get back to dreaming up my next evil...uh, um...shoot...nevermind.</p>
