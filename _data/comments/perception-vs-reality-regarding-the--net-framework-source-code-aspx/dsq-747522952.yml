message: <p>@mallcontent, @edfee<br>I can assure all of you with 100% certainty, that's not what happened in any which way or form.  What did happen - and I tried to make this clear in the podcast that I did with Scott Hanselman - was that this initiative originated wholly within DevDiv (and more specifically from within my little noggin) and is purely targeted at helping our customers be more successful with our products, full stop.  No chairs were injured or mistreated in the making of this announcement.</p>
