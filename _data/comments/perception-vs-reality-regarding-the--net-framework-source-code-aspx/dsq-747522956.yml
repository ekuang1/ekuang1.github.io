message: <p>@Shawn, I think the question is focused on the aftermath. Understanding that the intentions are pure, there are many out there who feel that looking at the code could come back to burn them later.<br>For example, they fear that the legal team may be opportunistic and see this well meaning project as a gift for their hunt, so to speak.<br>It would probably help to have a post that addresses some of those concerns.</p>
