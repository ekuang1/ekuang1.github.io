message: "<p>re: patent infringement.<br>Yup, that's one of the reasons that developers at big corps, like Microsoft, often don't look to see if something has been patented already. That way you do infringe, you at least acted out of good faith and without knowledge of the prior art.<br>I forget where I saw an MS employee state that. I believe it was on Larry Ostermans blog, but I can't find it now.</p>"
