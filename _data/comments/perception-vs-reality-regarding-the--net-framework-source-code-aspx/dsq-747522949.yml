message: <p>I don't think people are actually thinking Scott Guthrie and his friends have been cooking up some pinky masterplan to hold the world ransom for... ONE BILLION DOLLARS!, but still alot of them realise that Microsoft is a big company and different divisions might have different plans. While this is a very nice move on behalf of the Developer Division, how can we be assured that the other, potentially less friendly, chair-throwing divisions at Microsoft will use this opportunity to spread some more FUD towards the OSS community? I think that's what's frightening the people who are so vocal about this issue.</p>
