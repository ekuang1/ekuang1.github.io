message: <p>@Paul ah, but I didn't want to use an indexer in Ruby in this particular case. I just wanted to do <a href="http://indexer.foo" rel="nofollow noopener" title="indexer.foo">indexer.foo</a> or <a href="http://indexer.bar" rel="nofollow noopener" title="indexer.bar">indexer.bar</a> where foo and bar are the keys to the dictionary.<br>I understand the qualms about method_missing, but in this case, I wrote the class I'm monkey patching in C#. So I have control over both sides.</p>
