message: <p>I love the creativity of this, I have been doing c# work for a long time, and have recently done 3 months of ruby work. Monkey patching is awesome, it really allows you to think meta. If you use a lot of reflection and attributes, monkey patching is totally your cup of tea. I am hoping extension methods with c# using reflection will be able to handle method_missing in the future. Although clearly some kind of dispatch abstraction will have to be put in place, at the same cost as DLR, it would be a really neat experiment.</p>
