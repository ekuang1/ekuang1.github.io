message: <p>Hi hudo,<br>I am having the same problem as balaji and I have tried removing the default.aspx to no avail. I am trying to integrate this with an existing application.  When removing the routeDebug statement in the gobal.asax I get an error saying the request does not match any route.  When I run the route debugger as a stan alone applation and put the route I'm trying to debug in it works.<br>Please help.</p>
