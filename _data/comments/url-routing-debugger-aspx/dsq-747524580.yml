message: <p>Haccked, <br>I think I can use this code to implement a totally customized ASP.NET MVC authentication mechanism. In other words, I can use this to see which action has been requested, then see if that action has a special attribute (like NeedsLogin for example), etc.<br>Do you think I really can use this code?</p>
