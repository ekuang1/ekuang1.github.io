This error can be caused by a virtual directory not being configured as an application in IIS.". <br><a href="http://forums.devarticles.com/net-development-43/section-registered-as-allowdefinition-machinetoapplication-beyond-application-level-10027.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://forums.devarticles.com/net-development-43/section-registered-as-allowdefinition-machinetoapplication-beyond-application-level-10027.html">http://forums.devarticles.c...</a><br>It seems the issue is, not to have two web.config inside the same solution, once i got rid of the web.config for the web app all golden!</p>
