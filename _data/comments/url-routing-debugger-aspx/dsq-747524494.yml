message: <p>Phil, any particular reason why this code accepts a route collection as a method parameter, but then goes ahead and accesses the RouteTable.Routes singleton directly?<br>Is this an oversight, or is there a reason you did this?<br>(I told Scott that we should call this BettererRouteHandler.  Think about it...)</p>
