message: <p>This is good news, We are currently building a site on ASP.NET MVC 1, and the development for this will probably go on for another two months. I am thinking we should use ASP.NET MVC 2 since it's already in Preview 2. Phil, What would you advice? Should we wait for the final RTM? Does Preview 2 have a go live license?</p>
