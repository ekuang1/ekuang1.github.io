The problems I encountered I have highlighted here: <a href="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/post/2009/09/18/A-RESTful-Wizard-Using-ASPNet-MVC-2e280a6-using-Data-Annotations.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://shouldersofgiants.co.uk/Blog/post/2009/09/18/A-RESTful-Wizard-Using-ASPNet-MVC-2e280a6-using-Data-Annotations.aspx">A RESTful Wizard Using ASP.Net MVC 2â€¦ using Data Annotations</a>. Something like the Validator class that is coming with .Net 4.0 but that would populate a Model State directly would be cool. Great to see you are moving this along!</p>'
