message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>Thanks for the quick release, I've upgraded my MVC2 Preview 1 project without problems and enabled the client side validation, it's working great!<br>On another topic regarding HTML Helpers, does your team have any plans for offering built-in Fluent Html Helpers? I have thoroughly enjoyed the fluent HTML methods from MvcContrib and would love if these were included out of the box with MVC 2. A slight point of contention I have while trying to influence co-workers to try out MVC is always regarding the mass number of overloads and not really knowing what method param does what without invoking intellisense (i.e., is the first param of ActionLink the Link Text, the Action Name, or a Controller Name? The fluent versions make this very apparent and much nicer to use.<br>One other thing I absolutely love from MvcContrib is the clever lambda-based anonymous dictionaries instead of creating anonymous types.<br>Quick "psuedo-code" example:<br>html.TextBox().Style(border =&gt; "solid 1px black", width =&gt; "200px")<br>as opposed to:<br>html.TextBox().Style(new { border = "solid 1px black", width = "200px" })<br>Not much different really, just throwing my 2 cents in. :)<br>Thanks again for all the efforts!<br>-Matt</p>
