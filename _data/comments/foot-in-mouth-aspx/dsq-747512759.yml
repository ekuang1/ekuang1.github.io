message: <p>Internal vs Software company development....<br><br><br><br>To use a metaphore from cooking:<br><br>Do you want to be a resturant chef or do you want to be a hotel chef?<br><br><br><br>Resturant chef = software company.<br><br>Besides an ecellent product it has to look flashy and draw people in. Individual creativity is highly important. You have to choose a target theme and hope it makes it marks, espcially if you're going up against others in the same niche (fusion, ethnic, etc.)<br><br><br><br>Hotel chef = internal development.<br><br>Yes creativity matters, the in house resturant has to have a certain panache to it but... you also have to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Most likley for the low end cafe too and you same kitchen has to provide room service to boot. So you need people who can get the job done, consistantly but they don't have to show flash or cretivity as long as they can crank out the meals to a variety of customers. In other words be able to be creative and still make a hamburger for some kid in room 3344.<br><br><br><br>I've been in both worlds... and my general impression is that people in the resturant world tend look down on the people in the hotel world. Though I read Joel and agree with various things he says (and I even use FogBugz...) this is one of his more arrogant colums.<br><br><br><br>Final critique... He ingores, this time, the fact that the "best" are a finite number.  You're not hiring the best, you're hiring the best out of the pool you've been handed. After that it takes time and an investmant by the company to make sure you have the best (or at least pretty good.)<br><br><br><br>Of course I now starddle both worlds... I'm a consultant. :-) (custom software for external clients.)</p>
