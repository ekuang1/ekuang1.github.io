message: <p>To digress...<br><br>The chef comparisson comes from a book (The Kitchen Book:The Cookbook by Nicholas Freeling) where the author started in France at high end restruants then went to resort hotels finnaly returning to England and was offered a job running a higher end resturant. <br><br><br><br>I should have made it clear that chef != cook in my semantics. Geneally I assume the title of chef implies that one has actully studied cooking in a formal way, or at least apprenticed in a brigade style resturant. In other words if you cook at Denny's or IHOP or a small mom and pop places that don't know what mise en place is then you're not a chef.<br><br><br><br>Now for the anology I did not mean to imply that a hotel chef was less then a resturant chef. I just see a similarity between the two and internal vs. external development. In some ways the internal/hotel position is harder in my opinion because you don't get to focus on one grand product line to which the company is wedded. As mentioned before you have internal one off software that affects the bottom line, but you also have to create ad hoc reports, support legacy systems, create and support customizations to existing software. In other words, depending on company size and age, you will have a variety of things to support that a software house/resturant does not.<br><br><br><br>Then again I've spent time in both worlds and have found I prefer internal development as I can see a direct result both on the companies bottom line (productivity, savings, that sort of thing) and users. Getting direct compliments that you've done something that actually helps another person is higher kudos for me then knowing I helped sell more units for the company.<br><br></p>
