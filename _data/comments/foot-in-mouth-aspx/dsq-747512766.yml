message: <p>Man, how sad is that to only work on a single product for a single business unit full time.  That must suck.  I love being an internal developer because of the different challenges every day.  My week has included initial rollout of a SharePoint Portal Server portal for one division, writing a few Crystal Reports for our BI application (which I also wrote), digging around years old DTS packages to find where vendor numbers are getting truncated, automating pricing updates (which used to involve 12 man-days per month, will now take 2-3), generating labor reports for another division from timeclock data, in Excel please.  It seems to me like working for a software company like Fog Creek, you run the risk of becoming a one-trick pony.  Deeply skilled in one language or another, but missing out on a lot of other great technologies.</p>
