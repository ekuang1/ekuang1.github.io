message: <p>Of all the many  "George Bush is stupid"  jokes, this is my favorite, and my family's favorite, especially the ones living in England. I never tire of it in the least. I've seen another version, where Jesse Helms is substituted for Cheny, I guess because he was supposedly a racist, and had half-black illigitimate children, but some how I don't like it as well, and I should I guess because I'm African-American. But having both Bush and Cheney looking so utterly stupid is the best, of the icing on the cake for me is having Colin Powell be the intelligent one.<br>God, I wish my ancestors could have lived to see these jokes.</p>
