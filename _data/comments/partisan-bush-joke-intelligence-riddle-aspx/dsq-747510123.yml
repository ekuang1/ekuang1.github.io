message: <p>Not entirely sure why the Queen of England does anything to "run an efficent government" in this story, as Great Britian in all actuality is a democracy, and not functionally a monarchy. I hope you readers out there know this. <br>Other than that.. Mildly amusing joke. Though "Bush and Cheney are stupid"-jokes feel a bit played out. The entire world knows that already.</p>
