message: <p>I downloaded a version about a month ago and it still has LONG way to even come close.  This is a great attempt and I hope it works so I can run .NET on my G5.  <br><br><br><br>The biggest problem is that they are still trying to get .NET 1.0 working and Microsoft will be at 2.0 in the next couple of months.  <br><br>The best we can hope for is that they have a version that is 2-4 years behind the latest and greatest.  If you can live with that then you'll be happy.  If not then it will probably frustrate the hell out of you waiting....<br><br><br><br></p>
