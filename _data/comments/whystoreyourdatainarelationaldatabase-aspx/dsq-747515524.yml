message: <p>Several years ago I did a project with CNET data systems in which a Swiss company with a few Russian programmers created a business that used OO db's to describe any product sold by a company on the internet. They literally had 5 teams entering and cross checking data. So a manufacturer like HP would send its product catalog with part numbers. It gets entered into the db as something like PC - Form Factor. PC-Accessories . PC-Keyboard. Whatever was being sold had a form factor and attributes. The system was very efficient. The company then offered its service to any ecommerce vendor who would send their entire catalog of part numbers in and get back a beautifully designed very searchable RDBMS catalog of products - not OO but RDBMS. Companies like Office Depot and Staples use a similar approach. Anyway the whole thing was fantastic and the OO db proved a great barrier to entry for any competitors trying to reverse engineer the system based on a copy of the rdbms catalogue. I dont think anyone has been able to crack their business. <br></p>
