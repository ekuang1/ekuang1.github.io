message: <p>Unfortunately this is the hardest time to figure out what to wear along the middle southeast; mid 70's during the day, 30's to 40's at night/early morning (as it relates to the commute).  Should stay warm-ish until around t-giving, then we'll have highs in the 40's until March.<br><br><br><br>You CA/FL folks are spoiled weather-wise :-).</p>
