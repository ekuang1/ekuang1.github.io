message: <p>k you guys don't know what you're talking about. to you those moves are pointless and you'll get destroyed if you try that shit on the field, but those guys are pro, up against the best defenders in the world and they have the quickness, creativity, and deception to pull those off. that is a tight video i think, cuz unlike those freestyle videos, which you really cant use much if any of the moves on the field, this is real game situation. this video gives me ideas of stuff to practice and creative ways of beating an opponent. this dind of stuff is what nike should do, instead of the freestyle videos, like the ship stuff a few years back, i loved that campaign, and it was so great to watch. please nike, make another campaign like the players on ship, or maybe just bring back that one, just with different players.</p>
