message: <p>How can I register a custom server control in web config and use it both (1) declartively in the code-infront of an ASPX page as well as (2) use it as a class library in a .CS file in App_Code? I can do (1) but I cannot seem to do (2). Do you have any hints? Please advise. Thank you. -- Mark Kamoski</p>
