message: <p>Great idea. To add to that some projects can go quite for a while and it's helpful to let some contributors know that you are still around. I have one project that I've been quite on for a couple months for various reasons. Recently I grabbed a screenshot of usage analytics for a few features someone added and sent them the screenshot with a thank you. It showed them that their work is actively being used and helping people. Lets them know the project is still going but just in a quite phase.</p>
