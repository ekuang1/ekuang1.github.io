message: "<p>I have a related question, and that is: normally after a PR of mine gets merged, I find it's courtesy to thank the maintainer for the merge too, but I worry if this is just generating too much \"noise\". What's the etiquette here?<br>I have to say the majority of my experiences on GitHub are positive; maybe because I mostly contribute to smaller projects, although MS's Visual Studio Code team has been great too.<br>Yeah it gets you down when you come across a grumpy maintainer or one that closes issues or merges PRs without saying anything, but you have to try to just move on.</p>"
