message: <p>I have been using GHfW for a couple of months and I love it.  It does make working with my repos much easier.  I do have one issue that comes up periodically regarding self-hosted SSH only Repositories (which is what I have). The issue is that when an update of portable git in installed it uses the default (or overwrites the existing) ...ProtableGit_...\etc\ssh\ssh_config file.  The only way that I could get SSH to authenticate me with my repo host was to add an entry to that file for my host that points to my IdentityFile.  It is not that big of a deal, since all I have to do is update that one config file following updates to PortableGit.  My question is, did I miss something and should those credentials go somewhere else?  BTW, I have Putty tools and pageant running, so from the Putty perspective and most other app requiring SSH access to this server the connection is not a problem.<br>But like I said at the beginning, even with this minor issue GHfW is a huge leap forward and I appreciate the hard work.  <br>Thanks,<br>William</p>
