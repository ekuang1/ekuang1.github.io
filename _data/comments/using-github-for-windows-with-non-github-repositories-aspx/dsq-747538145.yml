message: <p>Hi Phil, I just started testing out gh4w on our network repositories at work and I absolutely love it.  The UX is simple and intuitive.  It really reduces the learning curve of git which is great for new hires.  So far, I have only one request.<br>Being a large team, we pull/merge/push 10-20 times per day and deal with merge conflicts regularly.  This makes it difficult for us to ween ourselves off of git extensions with kdiff.  With a built-in tool to help us resolve conflicts, I could see our team going all in with gh4w.<br>Thanks for the hard work!  As a .NET developer, I was very excited when you were hired at GitHub and I am certainly not disappointed with this product.<br>-Ryan</p>
