message: "<p>@James: Please send an email to support@github.com with specifics on what's broken about the C# highlighting. Or better yet, send a pull request to <a href=\"https://github.com/github/linguist\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://github.com/github/linguist\">https://github.com/github/linguist</a> if you're really ambitious. :)<br>@Craig: we don't support that yet. You can open a Git Shell from the repository view and use the command line.<br>@Eric: We chose a simpler linear model to be in line with <a href=\"http://GitHub.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"GitHub.com\">GitHub.com</a> and GitHub for Mac. However, I've been doing some experimentation with <a href=\"http://haacked.github.com/SeeGit/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://haacked.github.com/SeeGit/\">SeeGit</a>. It's something I think about.<br>@Scott: We do support repos that use SSH, but only if you use an SSH key without a passphrase. We recognize that's not ideal security wise, but unfortunately, we don't have a way yet to inject ourselves into the process of supplying sshagent a password.<br></p>"
