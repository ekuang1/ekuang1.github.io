message: <p>Thanks for this. But am I not supposed to be able to use a repo as a remote without it being run as a git server? Why can't GHfW point to a second .git file locally? We would use git on a shared server, with everyone RDPing in â€” why can't we git on the server without setting up a server? (And in any case, I don't seem to be able to edit the URL for primary (original) remote for my repo, if I want to divert it from GitHub. Why not?)</p>
