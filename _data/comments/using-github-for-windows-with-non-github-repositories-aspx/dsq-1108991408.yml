message: <p>OK, I think I found the problem. It works when I don't run the app as Administrator. I have a custom console and I have an alias there for running GHFW. The alias is set like:</p><p>doskey github="%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\GitHub, Inc\GitHub.appref-ms"</p><p>When running GHFW from the console that is running as Administrator then the drag-and-drop feature on GHFW app is disabled, with no informative message or anything other than changing mouse cursor to "forbidden" icon.</p>
