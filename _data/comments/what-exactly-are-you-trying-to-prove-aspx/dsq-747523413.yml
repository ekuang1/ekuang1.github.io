message: <p>I'm from Austin and went to UT when Edsger Dijkstra was a lecturer there.<br>There was a rumor that floated around, that Dijkstra wrote out a C compiler by hand, on paper, and proved it correct.<br>That rumor may be just an urban legend, but I wouldn't put it past the guy.  Surely if it's possible to prove theories about complex calculus, it should be possible to prove common code pattern implementations, and then build on those theories to prove correct a large software product.<br></p>
