message: <p>Great post. I agree that those that think tests prove their code works are very wrong because you can only approach correctness.  100% code coverage doesn't mean your code is all correctly tested either.<br>I could believe that there are probably people (although hopefully very few) that do believe that their tests prove their code is right. *shudder*<br><br>PS. What's with all of the funny looking pictures? Is this something new for Subtext for those that do not have Gravatars?</p>
