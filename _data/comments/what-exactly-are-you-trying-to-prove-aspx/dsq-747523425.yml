message: <p>chuck, I should have defined what it means for something to appear exactly a number of times in a list. In fact, as you might have suspected, I should have written the spec in a formal language. Happily, Yves Bertot and Pierre Casteran already did it for me. Too bad you won't get to it.</p>
