message: <p>@pel This almost certainly an urban legend. And yes, it *may* be possible to prove something more than just a trivial piece of code, it would almost certainly not be a good use of your time. I could go through the pieces of my refrigerator to see if each part is working, but why not just open the door and see if it is cold?</p>
