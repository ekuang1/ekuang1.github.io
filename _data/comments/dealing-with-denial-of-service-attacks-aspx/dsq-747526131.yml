message: <p>I am experiencing something very similar (lines and lines of declares then encoded characters) and it appears to be an append to a query string in the vain hope that a stored procedure is somehow going to accept a verbose string as a param instead of an integer. It is very weird and happens almost hourly. The site is not down though and I've thought about a redirect back to the mitigating IP address. Is someone trying to overwhelm SQL Server but to gain what? If anyone's got any light on this, would like to hear.</p>
