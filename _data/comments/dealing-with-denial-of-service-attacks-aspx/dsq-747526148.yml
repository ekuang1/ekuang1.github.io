message: <p>The majority of these automated hackbots originate in China or Russia so if you wanted to eliminate 90% of attacks you could block those countries. There is a tool widely available that the hackers use to create an attack. They just enter the URLs that they want injected and press the run button. The bot then uses Google to find sites to attack and then tampers with as many URLs as possible in the hope of coming across a hole in the site. I would say this isn't really an SQL DOS attack as they tend to consume your DB servers CPU by running long winded queries involving convaluted LIKE and OR statements in the hope of searching all your data and returning no records. <br>The fact that your CPU was hit may just be down to the frequency and number of these automated bots that are currently doing the rounds. I was logging 2000+ attempts of this form of SQL injection up until a few months ago. I have reduced the number of logged attempts down to less than 5 day now by using ISAPI rewrite rules to redirect any requests containing the 3 most common SQL injection fingerprints about to a banned page.<br>You can see details of the rules and other quick fix "plasters" on an article I wrote about the matter.<br><a href="http://blog.strictly-software.com/2008/09/recovering-from-sql-injection-hack.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://blog.strictly-software.com/2008/09/recovering-from-sql-injection-hack.html">blog.strictly-software.com/.../...ection-hack.html</a></p>
