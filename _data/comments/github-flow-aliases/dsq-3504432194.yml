message: <p>I've found it's nice to let branches have descriptions longer then their names (say, commit-message-length), and having to manually edit a file for that, push it, etc. every time someone makes a new branch can be annoying.</p><p>Enter these two aliases:</p><p>git new-branch branch-name "Branch description here."</p><p>That creates and checks out the new branch, writes the description to a <a href="http://BranchDesc.md" rel="nofollow noopener" title="BranchDesc.md">BranchDesc.md</a> file, then adds, commits, and pushes the file. As a bonus, it also sets the upstream for pushing while it's doing so.</p><p>Then, to get the description of a branch:</p><p>git desc branch-name</p><p>This checks out the branch, cats out the <a href="http://BranchDesc.md" rel="nofollow noopener" title="BranchDesc.md">BranchDesc.md</a> file, then checks out the previous branch so you don't lose your work flow.</p><p>Together, these are super useful when you're working on multiple branches and are like, "wait, is banner-button the branch for the banner in the header, or the footer? And what was supposed to be the color scheme again?" Without having to go pull up your notes or switch to the branch, of course.</p>
