message: "<p>Very well-written, considered, and formatted post. A clean set of aliases/functions/personal utilities makes for a clean mind &amp; cleaner workflow. In making these aliases, I'm sure you clarified your personal workflow substantially.</p><p>A small-point: for xargs, you used the '-r' flag; I'm not entirely sure why you did this, and would  suggest an alternative.</p><p>There are a few minor problems with inclusion of -r:</p><p>1. -r is a GNU-extension to xargs, which means it will not work for many macos users unless they import that specific binary. I'm not sure which system you're on, but either way, around half of users with this invocation will have a fatal &amp; confusing error for this alias.<br>2. Even if present on the system, -r swallows the error case for 'git branch -d', that being branches aren't provided. With -r, no output is given, and so people are likely to expect it to have been successful, including yourself even having written the alias. It may be slightly confusing, because one would think \"oh but yes I did, I said `git bclean master`, but it at least shows an error when it should. (why are you running a cmd to clean merged branches if there aren't any?)<br>3. There could be a problem with one of the branches, but that shouldn't make git branch -d choke. Instead, for more flexibiliity, -I{} and then {} for the `git branch -d {}` invocation would create a branch -d instance for each run, as by default, it implies xargs -L 1; run, per each line of input from grep -v, the utility following.<br>4. Using the form: `xargs -I{} git branch -d {}` has a second advantage, and that's improved clarity. It's easier to more immediately tell what xargs is doing, both at first glance for those familiar, and for novices completely unfamiliar. <br>5. -I is compatible across nearly all systems/flavors of xargs, so you won't run into issues with macos, linux, etc.</p>"
