message: <p>For `up`, --rebase and --prune can both be set globally or per remote/branch with pull.rebase, fetch.prune, branch.$branch.rebase and remote.$remote.prune</p><p>`cob` seems a bit of a stretch, since it's the same as `co -b`, which is only 2 more characters (compared to `checkout -b` which is much longer).</p><p>`save` and `wip` could be replaced with proper use of stash (`save` is essentially `stash save -u`)</p><p>`stash save -u -k` could also be used in place of `wipe`</p>
