message: <p>Ah, fair enough. I will admit to using a "hotfix/" branch from time to time, although I try to encourage other approaches to that, but hot fixes are an old habit hard to break for a lot of businesses, when it "absolutely has to get fixed" before the next "scheduled release", because most of us live in hybrid agile/waterfall worlds...</p>
