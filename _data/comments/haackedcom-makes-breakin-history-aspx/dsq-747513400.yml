message: "<p>Phil,<br><br><br><br>Thanks for a trip down cheesy memory lane.  I forgot how easy is was to look fly in your marching band uniform and flat top afro or the  shiny pleather coat topped off with a confederate army cap.  Political correctness killed that trend.  I don't think enough men accessorize with the bandana these days.  I've just been putting one around our golden retriever's neck.  Who knew I could look super duper turbo fly with it as well?  Did anyone else have a crush on Lucinda Dickey?  I think my favorite film of hers was Ninja III: The Domination, but that may be because I haven't seen Cheerleader Camp yet</p>"
