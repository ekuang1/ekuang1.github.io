message: <p>Louis, you're cool guy and your work is certainly moving ASP.NET MVC framework towards gaining more popularity, which is simply what it needs to get addopted by coders from PHP/JAVA/RUBY world.<br>But as Ben said (and I stupidly shouted;-) you don't get intellisense, so you will write more and I on the other hand will just do *affirmative Sir!*. :)<br>Or even better, I usually use "soldiers" to do the design, and because they are generally "stupid" and all they know is XHTML/CSS I can't expect any other results from them.<br><br>What would be great for a lazy one like me is:<br><br>1. I'll import the design templates of all the pages in XHTML.<br>2. I run some _cool_ tool and it will transform them to View engine specific language (I really enjoy NHaml and I am not VB.NET guy) detecting common practices (very few in XHTML) and using View Engine tricks to do them "better" in less code.<br>3. Then it will (via some Visual Studio plugin) bring somehing like the design surface in code editor to better understand the structure (like different color background inside code editor for different blocks [think Firefox HTML plugins], highligthing the loops and "expanding" them when I hower on them with my mouse, and thinks like that, cool when I imagine it using NHaml).<br>4. And of course I will have FULL intellisense when adding/modifying stuff and bringing new ideas when connecting these things with JQuery.<br><br>Now I am starting my work with these bare views and connecting them to my controllers/models, and I am really enjoying what I see, it is like the design and code connected together, and modifying things is a pleasure because I really do write less and see more on a screen (NHaml doesn't have closing tags).<br><br>I think inserting some ASP.NET controls (which work) wouldn't be a big problem providing we would have source code, but it would be nice if the engines would support them.<br><br>wow, again a long post, that is becasue I am still a beginner in MVC world but I really like it, for me it is definitely better than Webforms...I feel more in control.<br>Thanks Phil for your work on ASP.NET MVC, and one question I allways wanted to write to Scott Gu but were afraid to ask ;-)<br>what about if the default views had .mvcx extension so we could differentiate them from classic webforms files more easily? I really like mvcx file extension ;P</p>
