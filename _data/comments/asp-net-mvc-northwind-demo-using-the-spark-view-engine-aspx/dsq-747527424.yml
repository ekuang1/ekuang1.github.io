message: <p>I've said it many time I'll say it again.<br>Despite many articles of (quite few) view engines and many many (and many more) gurus advocating them (and saying how the default spagetti like code behind engine is bad) I still see no reason to jump from the default to these engines...<br>1. .aspx gets the job done, everyone is familiar with it, zero learning curve, constant developement (etc etc), new things appearing on regular basis and I think it is quite feature rich<br>2. I can use some interesting free ASP.NET Webforms controls (recent example - charting control) quite easily as well as some paid one (telerik) and I don't see a reason not to do so. Can I use them in others? Like CAPTCHA controls and such?<br>3. In the end I am really doing just the basic HTML fillings, I am not a superb designer. Layout/Design is usually in the hands of Photoshop/XHTML/CSS gurus and they will deliver whatever C# developers need (and I just adjust minor things).<br>4. Imagine a situation where you will receive a lot of design stuff from your co-worker and you will start rewriting it to NHaml...wow, how geeky! I know it can be automated but...why?<br>A lot of criticism from me, nothing but success to View Engines folk. But just because I have a hammer in my hand not everything for me is a nail. I CAN change view engine, but give me _concise_ reason to do so.<br>Not this hackers (sorry Phil;-) toys that it looks cool and I feel better and (add whatever you want) but tell me something like - we've invented ASP.NET MVC controls which can do this and this ten thousands times lighter and better, supports JSON data exchange using JQUERY out of the box and partial AJAX updating is a matter of writting just half of a letter (you don't even need to click it, it will guees it for you =D ). NOW I will consider.<br>thanks for reading, maybe I am another newbie developer in MVC world, but Mr. Jeff Atwood built <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.stackoverflow.com">www.stackoverflow.com</a> using the defaults and didn't die (just was swearing a bit more ;-).<br>Now, I am really going to study spark, probably it has something which will increase my productivity, and will clean my car at least during the weekends :)</p>
