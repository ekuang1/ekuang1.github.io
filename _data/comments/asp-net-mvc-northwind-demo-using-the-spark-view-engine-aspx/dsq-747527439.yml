message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I'm really excited about Spark and all the things it brings to <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc world, why i'm saying so? because in the first time I saw the mvc engine I was really excited about it, but, the web forms view engine brings me, my rememberings, to the past, to the asp years, where the code was mixed up with the markup and all the things possible, and this makes me to not so think well about mvc..<br>But when I learned more about view engines, I saw it was possible to replace them, and I said "maybe it's possible to Ã²rovide a different engine, well organized and well structured".. I say this, because I really love Struts programming tags (eg. if, switch, ect) and the way them avoid to mix code and markup, I was waiting something similar in <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc which personally I think better the Struts way..even if, it's clear, <a href="http://asp.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="asp.net">asp.net</a> mvc needs to grow more...<br>So I really like Spark, and personally I'm going to use it in my next project.<br>Thanks and sorry for my english<br>p.s.<br>Uh, if nothing like Spark was come out, I was seriously thinking about starting a "call of duty" for an open source project to build up something similar...</p>
