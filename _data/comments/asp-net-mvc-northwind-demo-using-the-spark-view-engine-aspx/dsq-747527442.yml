message: <p>Oh of course, please don't worry about that. :) You're exactly right it's nice to have options and I wouldn't encourage anyone really happy with their technology to switch.<br>Also keeping a eye out for comments about what's missing helps guide priorities, so threads like this are very much appreciated.<br></p>
