message: <p>Bravo! Good post. I'm in agreement too. You can easily compare this analogy to the thought of wasting computer time and making slow apps. However, wasting cheap computer time to save programmer resources is a wise design decision. In other words, our time is often the most expensive in terms of software development and we all need to learn trade-offs.<br>In this business, if you cannot deliver functional applications in time, your out.<br>Writing good software requires that we make serveral tradeoffs with many factors out of our realm dictating most of the decisions. Blindly ignoring everything else in the name of writing the most efficiently crafted piece of software will most likely not end too well. <br>Simply, if you are creating the next best car with great milage, the fuel efficiency won't matter if the car doesn't work.</p>
