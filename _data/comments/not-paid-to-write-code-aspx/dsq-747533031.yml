message: <p>Hi Phil,<br>I think the space shuttle example is a red herring. As you point out, there is a big difference between quality as meeting business needs, and low defect count. Appropriate testing and whether you use formal methods or not depends on the context, but perhaps other forms of code quality are a more fundamental part of software development.<br>Posted my thoughts on this <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2010/08/quality-vs-shipping.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.davesquared.net/2010/08/quality-vs-shipping.html">here</a>.<br>Cheers,<br>David</p>
