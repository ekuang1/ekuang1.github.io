message: <p>@Joe I disagree. I think junior developers should care about the value they're delivering. After all, they're not robots. It's very gratifying to know that the code you write has impact!<br>When I was a junior developer, I found ways where I could meet the customers needs by writing <em>less</em> code. For example, by finding existing libraries that we could build on that solved their needs. If I were only focused on "doing my job" which is writing code, I would have written all that crap form scratch. Horrible!<br>I think when you focus on delivering value, you realize you're not being paid by the pound when it comes to code (unless you're an hourly contractor of course). ;)<br>And to all those mentioning poor code, believe me, I agree that quality is important. I'm not advocating choosing poor code vs good code. I'm just pointing out a distinction between good code and Space Shuttle code. I still set the bar high, but recognize it does get scaled within that high bar to meet the specific need.</p>
