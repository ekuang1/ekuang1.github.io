message: <p>While I agree in principle with almost everything in your post, I think quality still needs to be stressed to a certain minimum level.<br>I agree that there is little value in creating "perfect" software, but the other side of the spectrum (i.e. "time it market is everything") sacrifices your ability to push new features out quickly and maintain overall system stability.  <br>In my experience business trying to push all three points of the iron triangle at the same time usually find they have none delivered (expensive, slow, and bad).  And that my friends, is bad for business.</p>
