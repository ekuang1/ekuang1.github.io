message: <p>I agree. Besides, good code and providing value to the customer are not mutually exclusive concepts either. If something is hacked together in horrible ways just to meet a deadline and make a quick buck, the application will eventually fall apart (run slow, fail in weird ways, etc.) -- and that definitely is not valuable to any customer, unless they specifically ordered an "app that crashes every time I tab out of it".</p>
