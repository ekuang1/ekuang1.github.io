message: <p>actually i am really surprised why a lot of people in software industry are arguing about obvious things...<br>What you are saying is that "you are paid for results/value, not the process (writing code, construction work and etc.)"<br>In real life any customer doesn't care how much time you spent on bringing the value to them.<br>So, does it make sense to discuss such topic at all? Or is it software developers are SO special ?...</p>
