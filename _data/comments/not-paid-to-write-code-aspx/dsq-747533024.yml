message: <p>I agree for people in leadership positions - software development managers, lead developers, architects, etc. But several of the places I've worked have only one or two people who actually understand the business needs and make sure the solution meets business needs.  The rest of the department is made up of people whose job <u>IS</u> to just write code, and their jobs can be measured by code quality and quantity.<br>In a large shop, I wouldn't expect the junior developers to know or care about how much value they're delivering to the customer. It's simply not their job, any more than it's the job of the receptionist to make sure they're getting the best deal on long-distance phone service.</p>
