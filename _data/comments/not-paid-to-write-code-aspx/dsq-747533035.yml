message: <p>Actually, you most likely are paid to write code.  The fortunate consequence of you writing code means problems are most likely solved.  <br>Unless you are in a position to steer a company, you must play your part on the team.  Over stepping your bounds could put you in hot water with your management or team. (even worse)<br>That being said, I fully agree with your sentiment, but am skeptical of your rhetoric.</p>
