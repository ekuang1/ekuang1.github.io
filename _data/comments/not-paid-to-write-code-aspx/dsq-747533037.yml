message: <p>"As narcissistic developers (câ€™mon admit it. You are all narcissists!), we tend to see the code as being the only thing that matters."<br>Nope, can't agree with that. The only thing we all have in common is that we're all introverts. Really. You would not have spent your youth in front of a computer screen if you weren't. You'd have been out chasing girls.</p>
