message: <p>The first thought that came to my mind was "how typical, a program manager at the company that delivers the game console with a 50% failure rate is de-emphasizing quality . . . ", but I get your point, even if I believe that it was imperfectly delivered.<br>I would use the term "benefits" to the user, not "value". In marketing, "value" is most often associated with cheap stuff than to quality. Wal-Mart emphasizes value. GM emphasizes value. Lexus doesn't. Nordtram doesn't.<br>From a dictionary standpoint, "value" is supposed to mean everything that a user gets out of something, but that's not the most common use.<br>Also, I wish that you had mentioned usability instead of shipping date. Usability is intrinsic to value, but is often neglected.  Nothing sucks away user happiness like a poorly designed interface. Let's say that I'm late for work and I've got 5 minutes to use a site to make an online transaction. I can't be slowed, because I couldn't figure out an unintuitive UI.</p>
