message: <p>Phil,<br>I hope this post is not a reaction to any recent evaluations.<br>To many people, you are a coding "God" .... your small team has recently revoultionised web development on the MS stack and all indications are that you will continue to do so.<br>I for one appreciate every blog you make and the contributions you have made to the betterment of the devleoper world could be considered priceless.<br>To use any simple "metric" against such outstanding skills in communication, foresight and "setting the right eample" would be silly to say the least.<br>Keep doing things the way you have been doing them!<br></p>
