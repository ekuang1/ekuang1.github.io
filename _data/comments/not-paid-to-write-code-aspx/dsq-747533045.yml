message: <p>Explains why we wrote superb/well packaged apps and never got anyone to buy into the product :-(. Did take my money though so in that instance.. i suppose was paid to write code.. :-D<br>Provocative piece... given me something to ponder over.... Although i wonder, In the instance that your customers care more about efficiency/maintenability code than delivery would this still apply? I reckon you cannot always achieve the same result with the same tactic.. Considering external factors are also in play</p>
