message: <p>A project can be done fast, done right, or done cheaply. Pick 2. You will never ever be able to pick 3 unless you find someone like Mr. Haack to write code for free. =P <br>Like anything in the world. Development is a balance of many things. There is a perfect balance to every project. The problem is getting everyone from the CEO down to the lowest code monkey to be on the same page.</p>
