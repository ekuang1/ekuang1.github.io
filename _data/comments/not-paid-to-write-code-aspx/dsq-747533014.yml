message: <p>At my last job I had a statement similar to what you said.  The code we were working on was far from complex.  It was a lot of database calls, and handling a process. <br>I remarked that if we're getting paid to write code, we're ripping the company off.  Because they could always find someone cheaper to write this code.<br>We're getting paid to help solve business problems.  Sometimes that means identifying bottlenecks, sometimes it means seeing bad policies, and sometimes it means finding the off-the-shelf software that will solve their problems.</p>
