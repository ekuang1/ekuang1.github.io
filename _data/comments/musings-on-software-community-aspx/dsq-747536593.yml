message: <p>Could it be that 1) .Net folks are also better supported given the MS and non-MS resources available, 2) there is more of a possibility of a critical mass of MS-knowledgeable folks at work that you can network with than for some of these other tools, 3) we're too busy to attend multiple user group meetings -- I know I am, or 4) we're all so specialized in our tools that you may be only interested one LUG?  <br>Making the blanket statement that .Net people are isolated simply because they don't go to multiple LUG meetings is a bit of a stretch, imo.<br>Plus, there's the argument that monthly LUG meetings are antiquated and only useful for those looking for jobs, looking for new employees, or consultants looking for new business.<br>Personally, I only go to a monthly meeting if the presentation seems useful (and I leave immediately if it's not) or as part of the cheering section if one of my co-workers is making the presentation.  Otherwise, going home to have dinner and a drink seems a lot more productive to me.<br></p>
