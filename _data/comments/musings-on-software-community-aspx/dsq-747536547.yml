message: <p>I would have an upcoming post related to this, but the question is what is the outcome of community for a .NET developer to be active on it? To be honest, I haven't received anything for my community contributions and feel that it's been like a one-way highway from me to the so-called *community*. Recently, I had a very bad experience that totally turned me cold about any engagement on this community. The .NET community is mostly built on top of some small networks of people based on geo-location and I didn't find it very open to new names and faces. I would say other communities are really different and it's not about the variety of skills but also about the nature of the community, the communications, and the outcome, and I believe that they have been more successful than the Microsoft/.NET community.</p>
