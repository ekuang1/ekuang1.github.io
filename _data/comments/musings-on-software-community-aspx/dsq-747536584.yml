message: <p>I totally understand this point of view, but some of us have lives to lead as well as code to write! I'm more of a systems architect these days; I know T-SQL, C#, VB, JS, CSS and HTML... but I still very much consider myself a .Net developer. To be honest, my primary focus are design patterns, but even those are implemented differently between languages / platforms. I've dabbled in Java, PHP, C++, Oracle and Flash, but unless I spend a lot more time on them, I wouldn't proclaim myself competent at all...<br>The problem is that there are so many aspects to .Net, I don't have time to look in to many other languages / platforms. With Entity Framework, MVC, Winforms, Webforms, WCF, WPF, WWF, LINQ, plus all of the extensions, plugins and nuget libraries available for Visual Studio, it's very hard not to become consumed in .Net and blinker everything else.<br>Besides, what do these other technologies offer us that .Net doesn't? From what I can see; just a "preferred" way of getting a similar end result. If I speak to a developer who writes in different languages, I'll always try to relate what they're saying to what I know... some things are lost in translation, but that's why they're called "languages" :)<br>I've seen a lot of developers move from older technologies (such as VB6, for example) and try to use .Net in the same way, without even trying to understand the differences. It makes me a bit sad, if I'm honest. I'm still learning, and always will be, but those who are unwilling to accept the change that newer technology provides us with are unlikely to learn much more, regardless of the language they're developing in.<br>I say, if you have time, learn as many platforms as possible... but I don't think those of us who don't have time are missing out all that much?</p>
