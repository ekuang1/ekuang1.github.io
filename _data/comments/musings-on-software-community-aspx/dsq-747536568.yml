message: <p>I recently moved from Portland, OR to St. Louis, MO where I immediately connected with the <a href="http://Alt.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Alt.net">Alt.net</a> user group here. The first meetup I will be able to attend will not be for a bit, but I am interested in learning more about this community of .net focused devs who consider embracing other (<a href="http://non-.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="non-.net">non-.net</a>) technologies a key part of their ethos. Your point about considering oneself a "software developer" first is right on the money. Diversity of know-how can only add to your ability!<br>Nice post!<br></p>
