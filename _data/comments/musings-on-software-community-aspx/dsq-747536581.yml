message: <blockquote>Of course, Microsoft could do more to encourage this kind of thing.</blockquote><p><br>In part, this was the goal of setting up the Outercurve Foundation and of projects like NuGet. My hope with NuGet is that it makes it trivially easy for developers who might not try open source software to try it out.<br>I think parts of Microsoft have come to the realization (well at least I did) that with millions of Windows and .NET developers, there's absolutely no way that Microsoft can meet every need. There's too many niche libraries, niche requirements, that no monolithic company could ever meet all needs.<br>Rather, it requires the community to scratch its own itch. To meet its own needs. That's the goal of NuGet, to provide a community based catalog of open source in such a way that it's one click to start using such libraries.<br>I think large companies such as Microsoft are good for providing foundational elements that such community projects can build upon. For example, Kinect would have been hard to develop as a broad community effort. But now that Microsoft has done it and open up the SDK, I'm excited about the prodigious output of the community building on top of it.</p>
