message: <p>The following 2 quotes from previous comments is the way I see it here on the developers in my group (usa, mexico, venezuela and russia):<br>"But I also think that the .NET community at least in Denmark is aware of this, and tries to make som e cracks in this believe. Its always time to get inspired my other technologies to be able to make great solutions."<br>"I think a lot of .NET user groups would welcome people from non-.NET fields, but a lot of people in the FOSS world follow Stallman's view that .NET == evil, just because it was originated by Microsoft."<br>I think things aren't as black-white like many people like to believe. There is a lot of trying new things, not everybody is vocal about it. Those who love to preach their side as the one and only solution, are usually very vocal about it. Some people feel uncomfortable when that happens, personally I love the discussion and all that comes out of it.</p>
