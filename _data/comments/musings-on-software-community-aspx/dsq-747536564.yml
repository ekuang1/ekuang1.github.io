message: "<p>@John <br>Well I agree that they're a lot more tolerant towards OSS (i.e. its no longer a cancer). Unfortunately \"Turning over a new leaf\" is as temporary as a \"change of heart\" and FSF places their trust in absolutes, i.e. they want to ensure the software that they endorse will always be free of patent limitations. <br>Given Microsoft's recent foray into actively seeking patent negotiations even on software they didn't make or own (i.e. android, linux licencing fees) isn't giving anyone any confidence.<br>Note: FSF's \"Microsoft Empty Promise\" is in direct response to Microsoft's Community Promise, they don't believe it goes far enough which the article goes into detail about.</p>"
