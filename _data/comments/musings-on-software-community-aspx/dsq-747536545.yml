message: <p>Couldn't agree more. I've always found this unfortunate. Ultimately, as developers, we're all motivated - and professionally obligated, really - by whatever technology is working best for us in each project and circumstance. The whole us vs. them thing isn't just silly, it's self defeating. Great post.</p>
