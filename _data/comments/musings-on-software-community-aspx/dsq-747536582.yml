message: <p>@haacked<br>A problem with Outercurve (I'm actually surprised to learn of its purpose) is it has close to 0 mind-share, it was(is?) a project that didn't seem to hold any authoritative/qualitative voice and IMO no one took any notice of. Running on the side, not amounting to much. <br>What has significant mind-share is what I like to call the '.NET PR machine' VS.NET hooks/sugar, MSDN announcements/releases/blogs &amp; other high-profile .NET blogs, MVP awards, Channel 9, Mix, etc. <br>This is stuff that gets the most attention, if it's not mentioned on any of these channels it has a rare chance of gaining any noticeable popularity or community around it and very seldom is (non-affiliated/competitive) .NET Tech/OSS projects ever featured. <br>In a lot of ways .NET has been chasing other platforms for years, i.e. MVC, jQuery, package manager, ORMs, NoSQL/Caching, HTML5/JS/SPA's, REST, etc. Even when these technologies had existed in some form for years in .NET OSS variants - they aren't considered until either MS releases a product (MVC,NuGet) or popularizes one (jQuery). This repetitive cycle brings .NET late into the game and has shown not to ignite much of a community outside of MS. <br>For better or worse, Microsoft has the influence to point .NET mind-share into directions that would otherwise not be considered. I believe a decently marketed 'featured spotlight section' show-casing alternate/OSS .NET projects on NuGet could help.<br>Although I do believe NuGet has helped OSS projects to some degree by providing a gateway into VS.NET.</p>
