message: <p>The problem is the MS even today regards OSS with fear - I worked inside a MS team, and every time sometimes tries to use an OSS library, if it's not MS-PL on Codeplex, the first word is "OSS alert" :) and the proposal is dismissed because it would take too long for the lawyers to review that license (even if it's Apache or LGPL license).<br>About .NET communities, in some countries at least, MS tries to control them insted of encouraging those small communities to be independant. If one community becomes too independant, the MS branch quickly tries to create an "altenative" community under their influence. This, combined with the low credibility of some MVPs in some countries, have erroded the .NET communities that were strong at the beggining.</p>
