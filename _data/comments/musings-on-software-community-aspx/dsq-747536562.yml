message: "<p>@Demis Yep MS has a chequered history, but seems to have turned over a new leaf post-2005.  Not perfect by any means, but better.<br>Also, FYI, MS already have a license that protects the FOSS community from patent claims : <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/openspecifications/en/us/programs/osp/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://www.microsoft.com/openspecifications/en/us/programs/osp/default.aspx\">www.microsoft.com/.../default.aspx</a><br>For the record, I like Ruby (though Rake broke badly on Windows x64 on a minor version upgrade) and Node.js and the NoSQL technologies.  My point wasn't that the FOSS community are \"wrong\" - it was that as much as we are saying that .NET groups should welcome Rubyists etc, those guys should also want to engage the .NET community because there's cool stuff happening there as well.</p>"
