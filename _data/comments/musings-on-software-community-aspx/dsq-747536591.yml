message: "<p>@Joe<br>DotNetNuke is a classic example of a non-strategic, verticalal-targeted OSS project that Microsoft has no interest in competing with but actively supports. It's used as an example project used to show-case the ASP.NET platform and as such is featured in '.NET PR Machine' channels, e.g. a supported install option in the Web Platform Installer. <br>It's a classic example of the success a .NET OSS project could get if it was given MS support.<br>Other .NET OSS projects do not share this same fortune.<br>Java and .NET is not Apple/Oranges, for a long time Java was the #1 choice for .NET OSS projects, it's has recently losing mind-share to other JVM languages (e.g. Scala/Closure/etc) simply because the language has remained stagnant and shares a strong resemblance to Java 1.1 (and IMO the oppressive and less OSS-friendly Oracle is now governing it).<br></p>"
