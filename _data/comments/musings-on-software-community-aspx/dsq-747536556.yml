message: "<p>I always had this feeling, but I think it was more concept than reality. It was only after I left Microsoft that I felt as if \"The Great Decompression\" began. It was always IIS, ASP.NET, SQL Server - everything else was a nod to \"yeah I know that's out there. <br>I remember the precise time and place: I was in Portland, as I am this very second, and I had just given my notice. I went to Powell's Books and bought a Linux Admin book, Ruby for SysAdmins, and an annual subscription to PeepCode - that's when it hit me just how much I didn't know. And it was really scary. And absurd. And I did it to myself.<br>The good news: the learning process is fun, and I'm not as dumb as I first thought :). And there are a number of talented, helpful people there who are are ready to help with The Great Decompression.<br>I've never had so much fun in my career.<br></p>"
