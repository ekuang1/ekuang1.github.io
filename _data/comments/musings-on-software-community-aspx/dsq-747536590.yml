message: <p>Everyone has a different view of this "elephant".  My experience with DotNetNuke has been much different than other views expressed here.  I worked for many years in both the Java community and the Delphi community.  They were not much different than the .Net community.  If you think MS is controlling, you should have seen all the fireworks in the Java community when Eclipse was first released.  Sun (and subsequently Oracle) weren't exactly altruistic when it came to community engagement.  Likewise I found exactly the same thing when dealing with Borland and the Delphi community.<br>Comparing Ruby, python or php communities to .Net community is a little bit of apples to oranges comparison.  None of those communities have an 800lb gorilla in them and that fact alone changes the landscape quite considerably. <br>MS certainly had an adverse view of the OSS community for a long time based in part on their experience with Linux, Java and Firefox (amongst others).  But I have certainly seen a large thawing in the last 8 years in how MS interacts with and supports OSS. MS was very supportive of the DotNetNuke project very early on and they have only become more OSS friendly during our project lifetime.  While everyone may not share that view, it has certainly been my experience.</p>
