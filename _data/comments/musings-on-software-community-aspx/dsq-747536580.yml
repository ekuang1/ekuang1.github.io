message: <p>Maybe it's because developers in other communities mainly promote OSS projects and themselves either out of generosity or to gain the acceptance of their peers. .NET developers seem to just be looking for acceptance from Microsoft. (MVP, RD, listed on ASP.NET, etc ...)<br>Not saying that there aren't some .NET devs who do things out of generosity, just saying that most of the other communities don't have a central authority that doles out praise and acceptance.<br>I guess what I'm really saying is that the .NET community has daddy issues. One step away from stripping.</p>
