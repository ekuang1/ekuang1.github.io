message: <p>Great post and it is correct. I identify myself as a software developer. I recently started learning Ruby and CoffeeScript and there are great language features and ways of doing things that we all can learn from.</p><p><br></p><p>I do primarily .NET work and I love what Microsoft is doing with C#, ASP.NET MVC and other projects that are groundbreaking such as Rosyln. Still, at the end of the day, a language or platform is simply a tool to do our job, which is creating software that will create value for a business. Construction workers don't identify themselves based on what kind of hammer they use. They can use any hammer to get the job done.</p>
