message: <p>Great post Phil.<br>As a member of the IIS and ASP team in the late '90s and someone who worked on the CLR in the very earliest days I have always been a ".NET guy".  <br>As I was leaving Microsoft this last year I devoted a bunch of time to learning the "other stuff".  I taught myself Python, played with Node.js, and really dug into Ruby. I've now written enough Ruby on both Rails and Sinatra/Padrino to be dangerous. <br>When I first got started learning Ruby I found the community, somehow, more accessible than the .NET community. It certainly is a more vibrant and broad community, and it certainly has more traction within the startup space. <br>So I've enjoyed it and learned a ton.<br>However, I recently embarked on a new project (mostly for fun) and decided that the domain required me to learn a huge amount (online calendaring systems) and I would not be as productive in Ruby because I'm still pretty much a Ruby-noob. So I went all in with ASP.NET MVC 3.  <br>As I did this, and experienced the .NET community again, I really came to see the following:<br>- The Ruby community IS more open minded, but they don't see .NET as relevant so don't pay attention. They will quickly build a new framework or library and move on (within Ruby) and they will use things like Node.js without hesitation, but they simply don't even really know .NET exists.<br>- The .NET community is more closed minded and simply focused on .NET.  They will copy ideas from Ruby etc..., but the idea of actually building something 'over there' somehow feels 'dirty' to them. <br>I think both of these perspectives are wrong. I'd like to see people focus more on the problems they are trying to solve and just use the tools that allow them to be the most productive. Folks should quit giving people shit for what stack they use and instead focus on what they produce.</p>
