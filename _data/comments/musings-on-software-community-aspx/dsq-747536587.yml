message: "<p>Man o man, so many good things in this thread, from so many people: Haacked, Galloway, Belot, Conery.<br>It seems to me, that the underlying problems and solutions have already been covered. There's not one single cause, and the day to day followers of Stallman and (enterprise only) Microsoft aren't helping the situation.<br>I had a nice story to tell about why I prefer C#/.NET, yet still use OSS libraries whenever I can, but the more I wrote it, the more it went off topic. Maybe some other time.</p>"
