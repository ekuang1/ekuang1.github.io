message: <p>You can have my underscores when you pry the bits from my cold, dead, L2 cache.<br>Honestly, I'm agnostic, although anything that irritates Google is good for me. Google is NOT the MCP (anyone else remember Tron?) and we should not force our coding standards to make Google's life easier. Google is supposed to adapt to us, not vice versa.<br>That being said, dashes are easier to read, for sure.</p>
