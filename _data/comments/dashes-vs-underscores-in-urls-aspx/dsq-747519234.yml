message: <p>It's true that underscores are not allowed in domain names, but they're perfectly valid in the rest of a url (just as question marks, ampersands, and solduses (soldi?) are).<br>That said, I think some domain name registries do allow underscores in domain names, which they really shouldn't. In fact, that's what I was looking for when I came here.<br>On this subject, I like the look of underscores, because they more clearly separate words, while hyphens bring words together. That's their function in language, and I like to differentiate. But hyphens are easier to type, so I'm undecided. So far, I've gone with hyphens. Camel case is evil.<br>TRiG.</p>
