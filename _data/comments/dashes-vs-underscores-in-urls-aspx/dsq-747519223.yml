Why?  because it looks nicer than %20 which spaces tend to show up as, more often than not.  If you had dashes for the spaces, and then had a word with a dash in it, the system could get confused.<br>You can see what happens with these category names:<br>Wolverine-Hoosier Athletic Conference<br>2gether - The Series<br>Northeast-10 Conference<br>Northern Illinois-Iowa Conference<br>Magazines and E-zines<br>Magazines and E-zines<br>Ramstein-Miesenbach<br>K-12<br>Have Gun - Will Travel<br>Rehburg-Loccum<br>Co-Ed</p>
