message: <p>This article was extremely helpful in helping reslove a few issues I was having with Response.Redirect.<br>Now that I have changed to Server.Transfer I am not experiencing the bugs I was with the Response.Redirect; however, I am unsure of how to clear the buffer to eliminate the html content being attached to the original Response buffer.<br>Any suggestions?<br></p>
