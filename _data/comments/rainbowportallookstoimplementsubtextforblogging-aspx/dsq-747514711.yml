message: <p>Well at this point, it seems that DotNetNuke is still leading the portal game in terms of open source type portal developments.<br>Regardless of the fact that it's written in VB.NET (yuck!), it's still easy to extend, customize, skin, install and is constantly evolving to keep up with the times.<br>What is disconcerting about Rainbow is that it's in Alpha phase for .NET 2.0 compat while .NET 3.5 is already released?<br>Perhaps make it a proper open-source project to better DNN and get more developers on board to assist with making this the next best thing?<br></p>
