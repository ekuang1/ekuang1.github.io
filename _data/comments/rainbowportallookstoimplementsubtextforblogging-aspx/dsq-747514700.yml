message: "<p>Thanks Phil for a great snippet.  I hope SubText will be awesome as a new module.  When we get going, I will also make a forum for subText Rainbow Integration.<br>To the above commenter:   Rainbow 2.0 is now changing.  We are keeping our template interface and have now added API's.  It is now easier than ever to install and you can also install with SQL 2005 Express.  This makes rainbow completly free seeing how it can also be run with mono on linux :).    <br>We are making extension easier with zip file deployment in the works.  As it stands, all you need to have is a user control and anything you can do with ASP.NET, you can do with rainbow.  We even have copy/paste <a href=\"http://asp.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"asp.net\">asp.net</a> code funtionality.  As in you can write <a href=\"http://asp.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"asp.net\">asp.net</a> code into the portal and it will compile in on the fly.<br>We also have areas where you can extend your own web apps into rainbow.  Within 1 week, 1 developer was able to not only port YAF to .net 2.0 but stick in our latest Alpha 3 build.  <br>We have ASPNETDB membership on the way [ already in alpha 3.1] and racing to the April-June deadlines of a core open source product.  If subText also uses membership [ hint, hint], we could take sweet advantage of SSO.<br>Any questions : ramseur [at] gmail[dot] com</p>"
