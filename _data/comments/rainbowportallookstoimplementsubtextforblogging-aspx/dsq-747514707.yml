message: <blockquote>I disagree about the skinning hardship of Rainbow. It's the same process for both systems. With master pages in Rainbow in the next release, this should solve that problem.</blockquote><p><br>I tested DNN vs Rainbow portal in September 05...<br>if you say the problem will be solved with the next release.. it means that with the version I tested, it was not as easy as in DNN</p>
