message: <p>Thats why DNN sucks. It requires too much rewriting to integrate applications. It's easier in Rainbow. <br>I disagree about the skinning hardship of Rainbow. It's the same process for both systems. With master pages in Rainbow in the next release, this should solve that problem. <br>Phil, good to see that you've got Subtext out. The screenshots look good.</p>
