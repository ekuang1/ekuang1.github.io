message: <p>&lt;quote&gt;I tested DNN vs Rainbow portal in September 05...<br>if you say the problem will be solved with the next release.. it means that with the version I tested, it was not as easy as in DNN&lt;/quote&gt;<br>With Rainbow 2.0 release we will support ASP.NET 2.0 skins/themes as well as master pages.  This will eliminate all issues with skinning and allow you to use other ASP.NET 2.0 skins [ as most define the common web controls] with ease.<br>Rainbow 2.0 Admin<br><a href="http://community.rainbowportal.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="community.rainbowportal.net">community.rainbowportal.net</a></p>
