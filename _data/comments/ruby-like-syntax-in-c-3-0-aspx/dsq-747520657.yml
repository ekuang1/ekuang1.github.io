message: <p>To be honest I seem to recall Don Box similarly showinf how C# 3.0 had much Ruby goodness, so I can't really claim to have suddenly thought about it, only to have been thinking about if for a while.<br>The jury is a little out on 'fluent interfaces', for this is what is really at issue here, and how maintainable they are.<br>However I hope to be open-minded as to the possibilities; I get the impression some C# developers are pretty closed to usage of some C# 3.0 language features such as var, lambda expressions etc.</p>
