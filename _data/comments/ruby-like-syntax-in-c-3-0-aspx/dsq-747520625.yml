message: <p>This is exactly why *I* believe C# extensions are going to be the tits, and much bigger and better ones than Ruby is (or will be). As much as I really want to learn another language and another syntax, and as much as Ruby is more of a naturally expressive language it's cryptic when I look at peoples code. I wonder what is Ruby and what is code. Okay, so extensions is going to do similar things here but I personally feel it's going to be great to say link in a "natural extension" assembly that gives me this type of syntax (assuming I wanted it in the first place) and give me the compile time syntax checking I want.</p>
