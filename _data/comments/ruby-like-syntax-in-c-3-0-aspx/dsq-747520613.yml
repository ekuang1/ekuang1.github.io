message: <p>@Ryan - Doh! I hadn't seen Ian's comment.<br>Ian said:<br>&gt; not compiled so treat as expression of intent instead of working code<br>Hey Ian! We compiled it. It works! :)<br>@crimar - running around? How about right click and "Go To Definition"? I mean, you get the same problem with good object oriented design. For example:<br><code><br>ISomething something = Factory.Create("GiveItToMe");<br>something.DoSomething();<br></code><br>Now given the above code sample, how do you find out what <code>DoSomething</code> does? If you go to definition, you get to:<br><code><br>public interface ISomething<br>{<br>  void DoSomething();<br>}<br></code><br>You can only tell what is happening at runtime. With an extension method, you can tell at design time.<br>This particular extension method cannot be applied to a string. you can tell by the type of the *this* argument.<br>So the <code>Minutes()</code> method only applies to instances of type <code>Int32</code> (or int) and the <code>Ago()</code> method only applies to instances of type <code>TimeSpan</code>.</p>
