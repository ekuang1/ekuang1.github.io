message: <p>@The Other Steve:<br>Check out our latest checking for SubSonic. Working on this post with Phil inspired me to create a "Sugary" set of of helper methods in SubSonic (which Phil said we should call "SubSonic.Sugar".<br>In there are methods like (Dates.MinutesAgo(20), Dates.HoursFromNow(10), Numbers.IsNumeric("12"), Strings.Strip("This long string","long"),Strings.RemoveLast("long string with comma,",1) etc.<br>I know it's sorta silly, but hey, if using these saves some time and makes your intent a little clearer - hurrah!<br>The idea here, especially with Ruby, is the concept of intent. YES, we all know C# but in general you can't read C# the same way you can with Ruby:<br></p><blockquote><br>5.times do {print 'I love shrimp'}<br></blockquote><p><br>or<br></p><blockquote><br>    exit unless "restaurant".include? "aura"<br></blockquote><p><br>I stole these examples from Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby - something I've read for fun over 10 times. Do yourself a favor and read it - it takes maybe 2-3 hours and is one of a kind.<br><a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-2.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-2.html">http://poignantguide.net/ru...</a><br>Finally - "back in your day"? That sort of paints a picture I'm not sure you want :).</p>
