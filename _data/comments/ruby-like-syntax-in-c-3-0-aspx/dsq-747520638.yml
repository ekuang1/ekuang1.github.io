message: "<p>Please excuse my earlier comment.  I was having a juvenile moment.  :)<br>@Haacked -  I think what J.Irvine was implying is that DateTime.Now.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20)); follows a common convention across languages, a hierarchical OOP syntax that makes sense regardless of your native tongue, while 20.minutes.ago seems to pander to the English speaker, the English syntax;  e.g., the adjective \"ago\" applying to \"minutes.\"  I'm not saying I agree, but I think that's what he was saying.<br>I've got to be honest, while I'm 100% with Scott H. on \"sharpening the saw,\" I'm still not sold on Ruby, even with all the Watir scripts I've written.  I don't know if I'm hardwired for things like DateTime.Now.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20)), but that OOP hierarchy of properties and methods speaks clearly to me, enough so that I really almost derive some kind of satisfaction out of writing it.<br>Plus, it's very obvious to me what I'm looking at: DateTime (structure/value type) .Now (static property) .Subtract (method) (TimeSpan (structure/value type) .FromMinutes (static method) (20 (integer)).  I look at 20.minutes.ago, and I have no clue what I'm looking at.  I realize that's the essence of the appeal, but I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with it.</p>"
