message: <p>@Don - well it's not *that* bad, but wouldn't you say that:<br><code>20.Minutes.Ago</code> is more readable. <br>For someone with a lot of experience with C#, it might be hard to be impartial. You probably read <code>DateTime.Now.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20));</code> like it's the Sunday funnies. It's easy to decipher.<br>But for someone new to the language, something like this:<br><code>20.Minutes().Ago()</code><br>... is quicker to comprehend the intent of the author.</p>
