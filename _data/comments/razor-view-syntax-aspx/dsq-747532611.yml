message: <blockquote>what developers really want and need rather than too much pie in the sky architectural astronomy.</blockquote><p><br>There's quite a laundry list of MSFT teams and people that could really use some of that focus.  Far too many teams and L65+ seem to take 'make big bets' as 'make large, overly complex frameworks designed to be all things to all people'.<br>It's great to see the Gu org continue to do great work like this.  For shareholders everywhere, let's hope this kind of focus eventually becomes the rule instead of the exception it is today.</p>
