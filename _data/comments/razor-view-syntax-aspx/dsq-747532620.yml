message: "<p>Looks good. I have a question about HTML encoding, if @ automatically HTML encodes is there an alternative that won't encode? I think the # symbol would have been better as that's how you would do an automatic encode using &lt;%# %&gt;. None the less, I think Razor really simplifies writing code in views.</p>"
