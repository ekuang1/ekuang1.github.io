message: <blockquote><br>n ScottGu’s blog post, if you look carefully, you’ll see Spark listed in the view engines drop down in the Add View dialog. We’ll make sure it’s trivially easy to add Spark, Haml, whatever, to an ASP.NET MVC project. :)<br></blockquote><p><br>That is so exciting! Woohoo! It's about time. I love the Spark view engine and was hoping that there would be better built-in support.<br>This makes my day!</p>
