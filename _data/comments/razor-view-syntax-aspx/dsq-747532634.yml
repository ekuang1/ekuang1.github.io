message: <p>@Brett because I'm a hypocrite and I hate myself. :)<br>Actually, I hate it when they do it on Twitter. Or in a blog post that offers <em>nothing else of value</em>.<br>At least in this case, it was in the context of a blog post that actually talked about what I'm working on and I'm just hinting there's a bit more.<br>See the difference?<br>If not, then let's go with the I'm a hypocrite answer. :)</p>
