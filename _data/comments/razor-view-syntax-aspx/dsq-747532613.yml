message: <p>Happy to see some positive feedback here after the nonsense tweeted by some irresponsible leaders in our development community. <br>Well done guys, this is good news - the framework is evolving and it's great to see MS doing it's duty in that regard. Can't wait to play with the bits. <br>:)</p>
