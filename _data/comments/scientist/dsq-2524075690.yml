message: <p>Sweet! The plan is to work on haacked/<a href="http://scientist.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="scientist.net">scientist.net</a> under my GitHub account. But eventually, once it's been battle tested, I'll move it to github/<a href="http://scientist.net" rel="nofollow noopener" title="scientist.net">scientist.net</a> and it'll be the official GitHub release of the library.</p><p>Would love to have you jump in and take a look and merge efforts!</p>
