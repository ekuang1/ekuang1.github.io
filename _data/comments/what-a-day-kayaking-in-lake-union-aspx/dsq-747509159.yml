message: <p>The boat cannel from lake union took you into the mouth of lake Washington, an area called Union Bay (that is where you were under the freeway).  Accross union bay from where you were is the house my wife and I will be living in in about a month and a half or so.  A few paddles away from that freeway underpass is the bird sanctuary.  If you made it that far you would have seen a blue herron and even a couple swans.  <br><br><br><br>For those of you concerned with LA Traffic, Seattle is just as bad, just not on the lake!<br><br><br><br>-W</p>
