message: <p>@J. Irvine - A reasonable terror. ;) However, if you fear your coworker's use of Extension Methods, aren't you also in fear of their use of ...say...code in general? ;)  <br>Maybe it's time to hide their keyboard. I think the issue of abusing extension methods is definitely a worthwhile topic. I actually find Extension methods to be easier to understand in one respect than typical interface inheritance.<br>Ex...<br><code>public void DoSomething(ISomeInterface blah)<br>{<br>  blah.Foo();<br>}</code><br>When reading this code, what does Foo() do? You can use Resharper to find all classes that implement ISomeInterface and get a sense of the range of possibilities.<br>Now suppose you're reading code and you see <br><code>20.Minutes().Ago()</code><br>Since this is using extension methods, you right click on Ago and find reference and it takes you directly to the implementation. Ah! This method returns a DateTime. What does Minutes() return? Right click, go to definition, boom! You are directly at the implementation.<br>I think the real fear of abuse is that when I type "20.", Intellisense presents a list of 500 methods. ;)</p>
