message: <p>As the one who started the whole "English" thing, I guess I should respond. I agree with your assertion that the ".Ago" syntax is both simpler to read and understand - that was not really my point. The point is that the existing syntax, regardless of being "harder", is standardized. Language just makes it easy to illustrate. Custom operations implemented using Extension Methods need to be carefully designed or the result will be confusion.</p>
