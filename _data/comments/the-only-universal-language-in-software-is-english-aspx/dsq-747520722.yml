message: "<p>\"Feel free to create a programming language with all its major keywords in another language and see how widely it is adopted. Itâ€™s a fact of life\"<br>The only fact of life is that American English speakers a 'lazy' (just to avoid stupid) enough to not learn other language and expect other people to learn and speak their language. Technically much more people speak other languages: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_by_speakers\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_by_speakers\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a><br>So, from 6.5 billion only 0.341 billion English native speakers - around 5% (FIVE percent)!!!  And a lot of them do not speak American English but British English. So, claiming anything like - historical reasons, great America etc etc is just excuse to keep yourself lazy :) Do not forget also the fact that most of the \"great American's\" are foreigners who are paid to do the job that native once can't :)<br>There are human languages that are more precise, more expressive, more accurate and more short sentenced than American English and can be used even for programming.<br>Between Ruby is one of the languages that tries to avoid exactly this defects of English language that is  used in other programming languages. With Ruby you says more things with less writing.</p>"
