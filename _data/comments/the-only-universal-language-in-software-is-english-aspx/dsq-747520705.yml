message: <p>I believe Pascal used to come with compilers that understood all its keywords in French... which rather reinforces your point. <br>As for American English... as an Englishman with something of a love for English English, I still use American spellings in code, if only because it saves me the friction of having to remember one more thing. (All I need now is a way to avoid remembering whether the methods in a given library are PascalCased or camelCased.)<br>Anyway - for the record, I hate that. Please could everyone agree to use English English spellings?</p>
