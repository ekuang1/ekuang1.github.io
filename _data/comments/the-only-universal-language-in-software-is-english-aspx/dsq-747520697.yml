message: <p>When I was at MIX this year I asked Miguel de Icaza if he sometimes coded in Spanish. He smiled and said he "used to" but never any more since English IS NOT the Universal Programming Language, it's The Universal Language in the same way that Latin was when that Other Empire ran the globe.<br>The Brits started it, so don't get mad at us Yanks :).<br>I think the cart's before the horse here when thinking about Ruby. The joy of Ruby is because it's syntax is so damn clean, and it's clean, in part, because you write as you think - there is no translation from the thought "hmmm, now what's the syntax again for 20 minutes ago?"<br>A great example of Ruby's power (stolen from <a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-2.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-2.html">Why's Poignant Guide To Ruby</a>) is this gem. Read it aloud to yourself if you can't tell what it does:<code><br> require 'net/http'<br> Net::HTTP.start( 'www.ruby-lang.org', 80 ) do |http|<br>     print( http.get( '/en/LICENSE.txt' ).body )<br> end<br></code><br></p>
