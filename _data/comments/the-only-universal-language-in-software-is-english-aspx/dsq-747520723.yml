message: <p>Let's beat this horse to death :)<br>I think someone above brought up the point about OOP, and someone whispered a breath of "Functional". That's really at the core of this - C# is very much a OO language, Ruby is a functional language - there's a fundamental difference in thinking and approach.<br>And for all you wankers who complain that English is the Lingua Franca of programming - Really? I mean Really? (Phil insert that link here).<br>When writing, we do think in terms of the language - it only makes sense. It's because we're expressing <i>ourselves</i>. When someone's reading what I wrote, they might very well not think like I do. In that case, can't we agree that a common method of understanding is, well, ENGLISH!</p>
