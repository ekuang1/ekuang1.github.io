message: <p>I'm not exactly picking on COBOL, but pointing out how an attempt to have a language cleanly expressed in English failed.<br>You talk about good abstractions; ++ for example is a good abstraction; all languages have meaning and their own terms, be it English, French or C++. <br>You want to express intent? Fine; but English is not a suitable language for this, it's not structed enough, unlike, say Esperanto. English has massive problems, duplicate meanings for words, sentence structures that are not logical and so on. <br>The time example is an interesting one; simply because of the Add method; if we had a subtract method as well<br>DateTime.Now.Subtract(20 Minutes); <br>that would be more expressive and easier to understand. The use of ago is, to my mind, too loose. Consider, how much is long ago? What about "next Friday"? The meaning of that (at least in UK English) changes, according to the day of the week. Say "next Friday" on a Monday and it's the Friday in that week. Say it on a Thursday and it's 8 days away.<br>Code can express intent, and does, without syntatic sugar based on a natural language which doesn't lend itself to logical parsing.</p>
