message: <p>"but we get used to our language constructs; it's part of what makes you a good developer."<br>At first, you have to chain the elephant to a heavy stake driven deep into the ground using a thick chain. Eventually, the elephant learns that they can't pull the stake out of the ground or break the chain so they stop trying. Then you can substitute a rope for the chain. Eventually the elephant becomes used to the sensation of the rope around it's foot and thinks that it is stuck. At that point, you don't even have to drive the stake into the ground. Just tie the rope around the elephants foot and it will stay put.</p>
