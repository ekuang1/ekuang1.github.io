message: <p>Phil I think your analysis is flawed.  There is a big difference between understanding words in a language as separately defined entities, from understanding gramatical structure.  To you 20.minutes.ago make sense, but for some non-native speakers 20.ago.minutes makes more sense.  The C# example only requires you to understand simple words without also needing to fully understand sentence structure, verb tenses and other gramatical constructs.<br>If you don't think there is much of a difference - then try using one of the language translation tools to see the difference between translating a single word from translating a whole sentence.  The same word will often be translated differently because of the added context provided by the other words in the sentence.</p>
