message: <p>Ah Jeremy, the old Singular/Plural Table names debate!  As a recent convert to RoR, this is the one thing about it that Gets my Goat - so you can work out where I stand on the subject.  Also as  Python programmer I can't be neutral in the Spaces v Tabs debate either!<br>But probably in general, if you want to start a total riot and alienate all your work colleagues, start a team meeting by thinking out loud, saying, "I think it's about time we had some Programming/Design Standards in this shop - who wants to chair the Working group?"<br>Stand well back from that one!</p>
