message: <p>- ASP.NET v.s PHP<br>- WebForms vs. MVC<br>- Handcoded SQL v.s. ORM<br>- Inline C# (Razor) v.s. codebehind everything<br>- designer v.s. no designer (webforms / mvc, there are actually developers who say MVC is a huge step backwards, the lack of designer support proves this :p. Personally I NEVER want to see WebForms again)<br></p>
