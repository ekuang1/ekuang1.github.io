message: <p>Straight on!<br>But as Aaron said, don't dis cats. Also don't dis cat-like animals. For example, putting a fire fox (Incidentally also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda">an animal</a> if you didn't know) to work can greatly improve staibility and usability of your web experience.<br>(However, my personal religion is Opera.)</p>
