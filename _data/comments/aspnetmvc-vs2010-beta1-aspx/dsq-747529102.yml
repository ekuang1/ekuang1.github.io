message: <p>Love the conspiracy theories! Truth is that MVC would have had to lock down a lot earlier to get into Beta 1; which is a massively complex undertaking with integration of content from around 50 different teams, take a fair bit of time!<br>To have made the Beta 1, MVC would have been way less mature than it is right now.</p>
