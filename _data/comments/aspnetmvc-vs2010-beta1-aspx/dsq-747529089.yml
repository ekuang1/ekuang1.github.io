message: <p>I see that ASP.NET 4 has some new features which make it competitive with MVC from a routing standpoint.  I use some Devexpress utilities and they have been somewhat slow on adapting to MVC.  I'm curious if they are simply waiting for the next version to appear.  In either case, I am using all flavors of ASP.NET now (webforms and MVC) to cover all the bases.</p>
