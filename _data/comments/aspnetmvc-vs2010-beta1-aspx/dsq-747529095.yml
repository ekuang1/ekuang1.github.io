message: <p>The MVC team has been nothing but open with the community. So, I wonder why I shouldn't take their word for it. Features miss deadlines all the time. And let's face it! VS is a very large product with respect to feature set, team sizes, etc. Size requires structure, folks.<br>MVC enjoys one of the hottest profiles at MSFT right now. Even a VP blogs this thing regularly, for crying out loud. Moreover, there's a workaround hack for Beta1, an OOB installer is in the works and we are promised that MVC will make Beta2. So, I don't know where the apprehension is coming from. We can't wait to 'stick it to The man', can we?<br>ASP.NET MVC is a cool, cool one! We haven't had any sweetness of that kind (the team, the tool, community focus, etc) from MSFT in recorded history. But, hey, guys, let's not start a holy war yet. Better still, let's not even start a religion out of this in the first place.</p>
