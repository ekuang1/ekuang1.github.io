message: <p>I've spent 4 hours trying to remove Visual Studio 10 beta and .Net framework 4.0 from my system after upgrading to Win 7, all the microsoft installer/uninstaller processes where hanging in a loop ... but after 4 hours of tweaking reg keys, and killing installer processes to manage to uninstall VS 10, I can't really say how I've managed to do it ... Everything seems fine right now and everything else is working properly with no issues. Lucky me I guess, a full reinstall of everything would have taken me 2 days not 4 hours.</p>
