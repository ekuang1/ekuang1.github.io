message: <p>Glad to see that MS is really putting their weight behind MVC....Not wanting to read too much into this, but it kinda seems that MS pats you guys on the head; lets you build your cute little MVC thingy but doesn't want you to interfere with shipping their "real" developer products and the next flavor of web forms.<br>I know you guys are passionate about ASP.NET MVC, but it's hard not see the notable absence of MVC from the beta as a sign that rest of Redmond continues on the Clueless Train and still doesn't see MVC as important.</p>
