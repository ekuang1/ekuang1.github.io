message: I seek a kind of charity scheme that would be project/need based as against money-based (money just for the numbers)... one where we'd be be told something like... (a) you'd register as a willing benefactor (b) you receive notification of needs e.g. 1,000 people may be notified of say the damage caused by a hurricane in x country and be told "please donate $49 so we can get things for people in x country and if you'd like to join us in going to the venue, please click here for further instruction..." sometimes i want to be involved in the activity, and also get a sense of fulfillment that a problem is been addressed. This would enable empathy, trust in the scheme and an opportunity for an adventure...
