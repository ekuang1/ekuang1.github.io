message: <p>I thought Bloglines was the best reason to post an RSS feed. I read your blog through RSS; if I didn't use Bloglines, I wouldn't have time to check your site and &lt;a href="<a href='http://www.bloglines.com/public/NickDouglas">71' rel="nofollow noopener" title='http://www.bloglines.com/public/NickDouglas">71'>http://www.bloglines.com/public/NickDouglas"&gt;71</a> others&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, a writer can't complain about the size the publisher makes his book. Content creators will see our work twisted up and read in many contexts, and that's our lot.</p>
